        "content": "Children of all ages experience abdominal pain occasionally. But the causes of tummy ache in    infants  can be different than what may be causing your child's abdominal pain as they get older.  Here are some causes of stomachaches in children    (also see \" Abdominal Pain in Infants : Possible Reasons Your Baby's Tummy Hurts\") :\t Constipation  often is blamed for abdominal pain. While it's rarely a problem in younger infants,  constipation  is a common cause of pain in older children, especially in the lower part of the abdomen. Bowel problems are more likely when a child's diet lacks plenty of  fluids , fresh  fruits and vegetables , and fiber-rich whole grains. \t Urinary tract infections ( UTIs )  are much more common in 1- to 5-year-old children, especially girls, than in infants. UTIs may produce      pain in the abdomen and the bladder area, as well as pain and burning when urinating. Children with UTIs typically urinate in small amounts but more frequently than usual, have blood in their urine and wet themselves. They may or may not have a fever. If your child has these symptoms, see your pediatrician for an exam and urine tests. If they have a UTI, antibiotics can eliminate both the infection and the abdominal pain.\t Strep throat  is a throat infection caused by  Streptococci  bacteria that occurs frequently in children over 2 years old.  Symptoms  that include a sore throat, fever and abdominal pain. This is because swallowed bacteria can cause irritation of the bowels. Children can also get perianal strep, which is a strep infection around their anus. This can cause pain, constipation (because they don't want to poop) as well as abdominal pain. Your pediatrician can examine your child for either type of infection and may swab their throat or anus to check for the bacteria. If the results are positive for strep, your child will need to be treated with an  antibiotic .\t Appendicitis  is very rare in children under age 3 and uncommon under 5 years old. When a child does have  appendicitis , they may complain of a constant stomachache in the center of the abdomen. Later, the pain moves down and over to the right side. Children with appendicitis typically stop eating; they won't even feel like eating their favorite food.\t Lead poisoning  most often occurs in toddlers living in an older house (built before the 1960s) where lead-based paint has been used. If they eat small chips of paint off the walls and woodwork, the  lead  is then stored in their bodies and can create many serious health problems. Also be aware of toys, dishes or other products with unacceptable lead content. (Recalls are posted on the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission    website .) Symptoms of lead poisoning include not only abdominal pain, but also constipation, irritability (the child is fussy, crying, difficult to satisfy), lethargy (they are sleepy, don't want to play, have a poor appetite) and  convulsions .   \t If your child is exposed to lead paint, has eaten paint chips or been exposed to toys with cracking, peeling or chipping paint and has any of the above symptoms, call your pediatrician for a  blood test . \t Milk allergy  is a reaction to the protein in milk. It can produce cramping abdominal pain, often accompanied by vomiting, diarrhea,    blood in the stool  and skin rash. Children may also have a milk intolerance or sensitivity. This means their body does not make enough of the enzyme required to digest milk sugar, which can lead to stomachaches, bloating and diarrhea. \t Emotional upset  in school-age children sometimes causes recurrent   abdominal pain that has no other obvious cause.  (See  \"Disorders of the Gut-Brain Interaction: Functional Abdominal Pain.\" )  Although this pain rarely occurs before age 5, it can happen to a younger child who is under unusual    stress . The pain tends to come and go over a period of more than a week and often aligns with activity that is stressful or unpleasant. In addition, there are no other associated findings or complaints (fever, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, lethargy or weakness, urinary tract symptoms, sore throat or flulike symptoms). There also may be a family history of this type of illness. Try to find out if there's something troubling your child at home or school or with siblings, relatives or friends. Have they recently lost a close friend or a pet? Has there been a    death  of a family member, or another stressful event like divorce or separation? If your child has trouble expressing their thoughts or feelings, you can use toys or games to help the child act out their problems. Your pediatrician can also refer you to a child therapist, psychologist or psychiatrist. When to see the pediatrician for your child's abdominal pain Fortunately, most stomachaches disappear on their own and are not serious. However, if your child's complaints continue or worsen over a period of three to five hours, or if they have a fever, severe sore throat or extreme and lasting change in appetite or energy level, you should notify your pediatrician immediately. These symptoms may indicate a more serious disorder.",

        "content": "By: Mashette Syrkin-Nikolau, MD, FAAP & Hannibal Person MD, FAAP  Abdominal pain is common in children, especially during a baby's first year. While your baby can't yet tell you when their tummy hurts, you may notice some signs of discomfort. They may be extra fussy and squirmy, for example, and have a change in their bowel movement, sleeping or eating patterns. There are many different reasons for abdominal pain. Here are some of the causes that can bother babies. As always, be sure to seek medical advice from your pediatrician if you have concerns about your infant's health.  Colic Colic  affects about one in five infants. It is defined as increased fussiness or crying that lasts for three hours at least three times a week. Colic usually starts a few weeks after babies are born and goes away by the time they're about three months old.  Beyond the crying spells, infants with colic are healthy. They should not have any other symptoms like excessive sleepiness, weight loss, poor feeding, vomiting or dehydration. If you are concerned your baby has colic, have them evaluated by their pediatrician to rule out other causes of fussiness and irritability.  How can I help soothe my baby's colic? The cause of colic is not clear, and there is no one specific treatment. Probiotics, gripe water or gas drops may be worth a try, but discuss it with your pediatrician first. Other ways to help comfort a colicky baby include  swaddling , using of a sound machine (white noise), swaying and rocking and walking with your baby, dimming the lights, and giving them a warm  bath  or running warm water over their head while swaddled. Colic can be very frustrating and difficult for caregivers. If you're feeling overwhelmed,  take a break . Try setting your baby down in their crib for a few minutes, for example, or ask for help from another adult.  Excess gas All humans produce gas, even the littlest ones. Gas can be especially uncomfortable for newborns, who are still getting used to the sensations of gas and learning to let it pass. The buildup of gas cause discomfort, but it is not dangerous. Gas pain typically peaks at 6-8 weeks of life and improves drastically by 3 months of life.  How to help babies with gas There are a variety of ways to help reduce excess gas. Avoid feeding your baby when they're overly hungry; they may swallow more air if they are frantically feeding. If your infant is using a bottle, you can consider switching to an anti-colic bottle to reduce excess swallowed air.  Burp your infant  before, halfway through and after a feed. Keeping them upright after feeding can help their stomach empty.  Holding infants stomach down and increasing  tummy time  can help move the gas through the intestines. Bicycle leg kicks and tummy massage may also help. You can talk with your baby's pediatrician about trying gas drops and probiotics, but these are not always helpful.  Milk protein allergy (or other dietary protein intolerance) Cow's milk protein intolerance (also called  milk protein allergy ), is an abnormal response of the body's immune system to a protein found in cow's milk. Milk protein allergy is very common in infants. Babies with this condition may also have an intolerance to other proteins in the diet, including soy.  There are no specific tests for milk protein allergy. It is diagnosed based on your baby's symptoms. These may include pain with feeds (back arching, fussiness), vomiting, blood or mucous in the stool and weight loss or poor weight gain.  What should I do if my baby has a milk protein allergy? Treatment for milk protein allergy often starts with eliminating milk protein (casein and whey) and soy from your baby's diet. If you breastfeed your baby, eliminate dairy and soy from your diet, too, so it is free from these proteins. It can take up to 2-3 weeks for the protein to leave the breast milk after taking it out of your diet.  Some families choose to use special formulas with the proteins pre-digested. Most infants will outgrow cow's milk allergy by age one. Dairy and soy can slowly be reintroduced after 1 year of age with guidance from your pediatrician.  Infant constipation If your baby has hard, infrequent, and sometimes painful stools, they may be constipated. Along with abdominal pain, symptoms of constipation can include vomiting or bright red blood on the stool or with wiping. Always mention any blood in your baby's stool to their pediatrician.  Constipation  can be triggered by illness, dehydration, changes in diet, not enough water (if older than 6 months) and changes in routine. Common times for children to become constipated include transitioning to solid foods, toilet training and starting preschool/school. Some children will also hold back bowel movements after experiencing pain with stool passage. It is important to address constipation early on, as the issue can quickly worsen, particularly through stool withholding.  What can I do to help my baby's constipation? Make sure your baby is getting enough breastmilk or formula and other  healthy beverages  after that. (Note that while cow's milk can be a healthy beverage for children over a year old, but too much can cause constipation.) Once your baby is ready for solid foods, provide a good source of dietary fiber. Examples of foods high in fiber include prunes, pineapple, pears, peaches, kiwi, avocado, chia seeds, flax seeds, lentils, chickpeas and other beans. See your pediatrician for constipation that lasts for more than a week or if you see  blood in the stool .  Pyloric stenosis Pyloric stenosis  is when the muscle between the stomach and the small intestine (the pylorus) thickens and causes a blockage so that food cannot exit the stomach. Common symptoms of pyloric stenosis include forceful, projectile vomiting soon after being fed and poor weight gain, dehydration, irritability and fewer stools. Your baby may also seem hungry even after eating. Pyloric stenosis is most commonly in seen in male newborns between 2-8 weeks of life, though can occur in female newborns.  How is pyloric stenosis treated and diagnosed? An ultrasound can be used to diagnose pyloric stenosis. The condition is usually repaired surgically.  (See \" Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (HPS): Help for Babies with Forceful Vomiting .\") Intussusception Intussusception is when bowel \"telescopes\" or slides into itself and gets trapped, creating a painful blockage. Although the condition is rare, it is the most common abdominal emergency in children under age 2. Typically, it occurs between 6-12 months of age. Symptoms include periods of intense abdominal pain in which the child abruptly cries and draws their legs to their chest. They may vomit, have a swollen belly and dark, mucus-filled bloody stools.  How is intussusception treated? If your baby has these symptoms, call your child's doctor or seek medical care right away. The doctor may order an ultrasound or a type of X-ray called an air contrast or barium enema. This test can confirm the diagnosis while also unblocking the the intestine. If the enema does not unblock the intestine, prompt surgery may be needed.  Gastrointestinal (GI) infections Many types of infections can cause abdominal pain in infants. They can cause vomiting, diarrhea, fever and even blood in stools. Stomach infections are typically caused by a virus but can also be caused by bacteria. Viral stomach infections pass with time and treatments like antibiotics will not shorten the duration of symptoms. Supportive care, including encouraging hydration and treating fevers and pain with acetaminophen, is recommended.  How are bacterial and viral GI infections treated? Bacterial infections of the gut are much less common. However, bacterial urinary tract infections and pneumonias can also cause abdominal pain and vomiting. Bacterial infections more often require antibiotics. Bring your child to their pediatrician for any concerning symptoms including fever, bloody bowel movements, urination symptoms, excessive sleepiness or breathing problems.  Reflux and GERD Reflux  is the movement of stomach contents into the esophagus and sometimes the mouth. Reflux symptoms are more pronounced in infants because the muscle between the stomach and esophagus (lower esophageal sphincter) is not fully formed. This muscle contracts to help hold food in the stomach and prevent backwards movement in the esophagus. The muscle becomes stronger throughout infancy and is fully developed by age 2 years old.  Babies with reflux are sometimes called \"happy spitters\" when reflux is without discomfort and have no other signs of illness, like weight loss. Reflux symptoms peak around 4-6 months and then improve over the next 6 months. They are typically resolved before a year, though sometimes can continue until 18-24 months.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is when the reflux of stomach causes irritation of the stomach and/or esophagus lining. This can result in painful feeds, back arching, pulling off the breast during feeds and wanting to feed excessively.  What can help my baby with reflux or GERD? Giving smaller more frequently feeds and holding baby upright for 15-20 minutes after each feeding can help reduce reflux. Normal baby reflux will not cause weight gain issues, blood in stool or pain with feeds. If you baby is experiencing these symptoms, take them to a healthcare provider for further assessment.  Some babies with GERD require anti-acid medication to reduce acid and prevent injury. Talk to your pediatrician if your baby has any of these symptoms.

        "content": "​​Appendicitis is an infection of an organ called the appendix, a narrow pouch connected to the colon. When it is infected, the appendix can swell. This causes pain in the abdomen and other symptoms Appendicitis happens in 7% of all people in America at some time in their life. It happens most often when we are children or teens. The appendix has no known important function. If appendicitis develops, your child may become very sick.      Symptoms of appendicitis One of the most common signs of appendicitis in children is abdominal pain. Your child may say it hurts in the middle of the abdomen near the belly button or along their right side. The pain will continue and become worse over time. The pain may feel worse with movement, like walking or riding in the car. Your child may not want to eat and may feel sick to his/her stomach or throw up. Your child may also have a fever.      How is appendicitis diagnosed? Your child will have their blood pressure, heart rate and temperature checked. The doctor will see your child and perform an exam. The doctor will ask you and your child about the pain and other symptoms. If the doctor thinks that your child may have appendicitis, more tests may be needed. These tests may include: Blood test—to look for signs of infection Urine test—to see if there is a urine infection X-ray test—to look at the intestines Ultrasound test—to look at the appendix CT (\"Cat\" scan) or MRI test—to look at the appendix What is the treatment for appendicitis?\t Medicines.  The doctor or nurse may insert an IV in their vein to give your child fluids and medications. IV fluids will help hydrate your child. This is important because they will not give your child anything to eat or drink if they think that they may have appendicitis.  If the tests show appendicitis, they will give your child antibiotics into the IV. Antibiotics are important to treat the infection of the appendix.  Your child may also be given medicine for pain to help them feel better.\t Surgery.  If your child has appendicitis, a surgeon will see them. The surgeon will tell you if they think that your child needs surgery to remove the appendix, and also talk about when to do the operation. Which is better: medicines or surgery?  Your doctor will give your child antibiotics to treat appendicitis. This is important to treat the infection of the appendix. Usually, antibiotics are given before the surgery to start treating the infection of the appendix before it is removed. Surgery to remove the infected appendix is considered the best way to treat appendicitis. Sometimes, antibiotics can be enough to treat appendicitis. Your doctor will discuss with you if your child’s appendicitis can be treated safely with only antibiotics. For most children, however, surgery is required to remove the appendix. Remember If you think your child may have appendicitis, call your pediatrician or seek emergency care right away. The earlier appendicitis is diagnosed and treated with medications or surgery, the better your child’s recovery will be. If the infection gets severe enough to cause the appendix to leak or burst, which can spread the infection.

        "content": "By: David T. Schindel, MD FAAP; Humberto Lugo-Vicente, MD Biliary atresia is a    rare  liver condition that affects babies. Because of inflammation and scarring in the bile ducts, digestive fluids (bile) can't drain from the liver into the intestines. Most infants with biliary atresia are full-term and otherwise healthy. The baby will often have    jaundice , pale stools and dark urine by 4 to 6 weeks of age.  What problems does biliary atresia cause? Because bile is blocked from draining from the liver into the intestine with biliary atresia, a pigment called bilirubin, and other substances found in bile, collect in the liver, blood and other organs, including the brain. As these substances build up, the liver and brain can be injured. What are some signs or symptoms of biliary atresia? Failing to gain weight and developing jaundice are early signs that a baby may have biliary atresia. Jaundice is what you see when bilirubin collects in the tissues. People with jaundice have gradual yellowing discoloration of the skin and white parts of the eyes. Another common finding is that the child's stools, which are normally yellow, green, or brown because they contain bilirubin, become pale. Often, along with abnormally pale stools, the urine becomes very dark or amber in color. What tests will be done to diagnose biliary atresia? If you have any concerns, your baby should be seen by their pediatrician as soon as possible. Following an examination, blood will be drawn to check liver function as well as other vital functions. An ultrasound of the abdomen is recommended to look for the bile ducts and gallbladder. If these structures are not well-visualized, further advanced studies, such as a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan, may be needed to confirm bile ducts are present and normal.  What can be done to make my child better? If test results suggest a diagnosis of biliary atresia, based on increased bilirubin and missing gallbladder or bile ducts on a HIDA scan, surgery is recommended.  In the operating room, a cholangiogram is performed to confirm the diagnosis. This is done either through a small incision in the child's upper abdomen or through a laparoscope. To perform a cholangiogram, the surgeon places a small tube into the gallbladder, if present, and injects a medication that can be used to see the bile ducts using an X-ray machine.  If bile ducts are not seen connecting the liver to the intestine, the diagnosis of biliary atresia is confirmed. At this point, the surgeon will perform a procedure that re-establishes a connection between the liver and the intestine to allow drainage of the bile from the liver into the intestine. This procedure is called a  Kasai operation .   \t   Remember Regular visits with your child's pediatrician can help diagnose biliary atresia early and prevent related complications.

        "content": "By: Robert W. Frenck Jr., MD, FAAP\t Clostridioides difficile —sometimes called    C difficile  or \" C diff \" for short—is a type of bacteria that up to 5% of people have in their digestive system. About half of healthy babies under age 1 year have    C diff  in their stool without any symptoms. However, sometimes  C diff  bacteria produce a toxin (poison) that causes diarrhea, stomach cramps and colitis (gut inflammation).  It is not clear why so many children have the bacteria but do not become sick. However, it may be related to the balance of other bacteria living in the gut. Read on to learn how the bacteria spreads, symptoms of and risk factors for  C diff  infection and how it may be treated. How do children get C difficile? The bacteria spread through the poop of an infected person. This can happen when a child touches an object or surface with the bacteria on it and then puts their fingers into their mouth, for example.\t C difficile  was called    Clostridium difficile  when it was discovered in 1935. Researchers are still learning more about    C difficile  in infants and young children. We do know that    C diff  is associated with recent antibiotic use. When antibiotics kill \"bad\" bacteria, they also kill \"good\" bacteria. Some of the healthy bacteria that get killed are those that help keep    C diff  bacteria from causing an infection. Because of this risk, children should    only take antibiotics when needed  to get rid of a bacterial infection. It's estimated that at least half of all antibiotics prescribed for children at medical and dental visits are not necessary. What are symptoms of C difficile? A child with mild C. diff illness may have diarrhea, a mild stomachache and low fever. More severe symptoms include a high fever, stomach cramps, bloating and sometimes blood in the stool or bloody diarrhea. Just finding    C diff  in the stool is not enough to say that the bacteria are the cause of a child's diarrhea. When diarrhea does not go away, your child's stool can be tested for toxins produced by    C difficile.\t A child with    C difficile  should be taken off their antibiotic. In mild cases, children often get better once they stop taking the antibiotics. If your child does not get better, they may need to be given a different antibiotic than the one that caused the infection, such as metronidazole or vancomycin. Despite antibiotic treatment for    C diff , about 2 to 3 out of 10 people continue to have symptoms. They may need two or more courses of antibiotics. If a child has a stubborn infection that keeps coming back, a treatment called    fecal microbiota transplantation , or FMT, may be recommended. For FMT, a product that is    prepared from stool  from a healthy donor is given to the person to help replace \"good\" bacteria in their gut. How long should my child stay home from child care or school if they have C diff? People can carry C diff  in their body or on their skin and    spread it to others . Keep your child out of child care until their symptoms get better. Children with    C difficile  diarrhea may return to child care when: Stools can be contained in the diaper well, or potty-trained children do not have toileting accidents.  The stool frequency is no more than 2 stools above that child's normal frequency.  Children do not need another stool test to see if the infection is gone. C diff can remain in the stool for weeks after symptoms have resolved. How to prevent C diff infection To avoid spreading germs to others, handle    dirty diapers  and other waste matter with care. Always wash your hands with soap and water to remove    C diff  bacteria. Hand sanitizer does not get rid of the germs. Recent antibiotic use may raise your child's risk of    C difficile  infection. If your child has an    ear infection , for example, your pediatrician may take a wait-and-see approach and only prescribe    antibiotics  when absolutely necessary. Talk with your pediatrician if you have questions about keeping your child healthy.

        "content": "Campylobacter  are a type of bacteria that produce infections in the GI tract. They are a major bacterial cause of diarrheal sickness among children in the United States. You may hear your pediatrician use the names  Campylobacter jejuni  or  Campylobacter coli,  which are the most common  Campylobacter  species associated with  diarrhea . Common ways that a child can get the infection are from  contaminated food , especially undercooked chicken;  unpasteurized milk ; and household  pets , most often puppies, cats, hamsters and birds. Infection can also spread by person-to-person contact. The incubation period is usually 2 to 7 days.\t Signs and Symptoms\t Illness caused by  Campylobacter  infections includes diarrhea, stomach pain, and fever. Blood may be present in the stools. In young infants, bloody diarrhea may be the only sign that an infection is present. Severe diarrhea can cause dehydration, with symptoms such as excessive thirst and a decline in the frequency of urination.  Campylobacter  can also enter the blood stream and infect other organs, though this is not common.\t In rare cases, complications caused by the body’s immune system may develop. The antibodies made against  Campylobacter  can react against the child’s body, causing an uncommon form of arthritis called reactive arthritis, a skin sore called erythema nodosum, and a serious condition of the nerves called Guillain-Barré syndrome. With Guillain-Barré syndrome, the child develops weakness that usually starts in the legs and moves up the body.\t What You Can Do\t If your child has blood in his diarrhea or stools, you should call your pediatrician. Children with  Campylobacter  infections tend to get better on their own without any particular treatment. Until your child’s diarrhea goes away, make sure he drinks lots of fluids. Rehydration fluids are sold in stores, but can also be made at home. Talk to your pediatrician about how to include the proper amount of salt and sugar.\t How Is the Diagnosis Made?\t The blood and feces can be tested in the laboratory for the presence of  Campylobacter  bacteria. This will help your pediatrician give you an exact diagnosis of the cause of your child’s diarrhea.\t Treatment\t Sometimes, particularly when a  Campylobacter  infection is severe, antibiotics may be given. If taken early in the course of the illness, antibiotics such as erythromycin and azithromycin can eliminate the bacteria from the stool in 2 to 3 days and shorten the length of the illness. When your pediatrician gives these medicines, make sure your child takes them as instructed. Over the counter antidiarrheal medicines may make your child sicker and should not be taken if there is blood in the stools.\t What Is the Prognosis?\t If your child has a mild  Campylobacter  infection, the illness may last only for a day or two. In other cases, youngsters may recover within a week, although about 20% have a relapse or a prolonged or severe illness.\t Prevention\t Many cases of  Campylobacter  infections are connected with touching or eating undercooked poultry. Therefore, proper food handling and preparation are important. \t To prevent these infections in your family:\t Wash your hands  thoroughly after handling raw poultry. Also, wash cutting boards and utensils with soap and water after they’ve been in contact with raw poultry. It is important to cook poultry thoroughly before eating.\t Drink only milk that has been pasteurized.\t Because pets can be carriers of  Campylobacter  bacteria, members of your family should wash their hands thoroughly after having contact with the feces of dogs, cats, hamsters, and birds.\t Wash your hands carefully after touching the underclothes or  diapers  of young children and infants with diarrhea.\t Children should always wash their hands before eating.\t If a child that attends child care has diarrhea, you should tell the caregivers right away.\t Preventing Gastroenteritis\t Wash your hands.\t Don’t share utensils.\t Wash and/or peel raw fruits and vegetables.\t Cook meats thoroughly.\t Avoid contaminating foods eaten raw (eg, fruit, salad) with foods that get cooked (eg, chicken, turkey, beef, pork).",

        "content": "​By: Anthony Porto, MD, MPH, FAAP People are thinking about celiac disease and the possibility of a gluten intolerance more often now than they have in the past. About 30% of people living in the United States are following some form of a gluten-free diet—either by choice or due to a medical condition.  In this article, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) answers common questions about celiac disease, gluten-related disorders, and following how children can follow a gluten-free diet. What is celiac disease? Celiac disease is a life-long condition affecting the small intestine. When a person with celiac disease eats, or is exposed to gluten (a protein found in food that contains rye, barley and wheat), his or her body destroys the intestinal villi—small, finger-like projections in the small intestine that absorb nutrients from food. Damage to the villi means that nutrients from food cannot be properly absorbed by the body and can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms, poor absorption of nutrients, and potentially to poor weight gain. No matter how much a person eats, he or she remains malnourished. When this happen to children, it can affect their growth and development. Once a child stops eating gluten, the villi heal and can absorb nutrients normally. Who is at risk for celiac disease? Approximately 35-40% of people carry one or both celiac genes —called HLA-DQ2 and DQ8.  Those who carry one or both genes are considered to be \"at risk\" of developing celiac disease, although only a small percentage will actually develop the condition. In addition, children with certain conditions and/or syndromes may be more at risk for celiac disease.  Children with one or more of the following are at an increased risk of developing celiac disease and should be considered for testing: First-degree relatives (children, siblings) of a person with celiac disease Down syndrome Type 1 diabetes Selective IgA deficiency Turner syndrome Williams syndrome Autoimmune thyroiditis What are the symptoms of celiac disease? The symptoms of celiac disease vary widely and are influenced by age.  Very young children  may have poor growth, which begins at the time that they start eating any gluten-containing  solid foods —about 6 months of age.  Other classic symptoms in children this age are diarrhea and gas.   Older children and teens  may have other symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. Non-gastrointestinal symptoms include delayed growth during puberty ( short stature ), skin rashes, iron deficiency  anemia  that does not respond to iron supplementation, elevated liver function tests, and bone problems (osteoporosis).  Note that some children, particularly those in high-risk groups, will not show any symptoms and are typically found to have celiac disease through a blood test.  What is the difference between celiac disease and gluten sensitivity? In addition to celiac disease, there are two other classes of gluten-related disorders: wheat allergy and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.  Wheat allergy  is an immediate, allergic response to wheat protein (IgE-mediated). It can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms and other symptoms seen with celiac disease.  Non-celiac gluten sensitivity  is not well defined, and some doctors believe it may only be caused by an intolerance to wheat and not to all gluten-containing grains. The type of intolerance seen in non-celiac gluten sensitivity does not lead to intestinal inflammation, as is seen in celiac disease. How do I know if my child has celiac disease or another gluten-related disorder? For celiac disease:  Several tests are done to officially diagnose celiac disease. The first step is a blood test to look for certain antibodies—including tissue transglutaminase IgA. The level of these antibodies is usually high in people with celiac disease, but it is almost never increased in people without it. If the test is positive, a biopsy of the small intestine is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease. The biopsy is usually collected during a test called an upper endoscopy—where a tube with a small camera on the tip is passed into the mouth and down the gastrointestinal tract and removes small pieces of the surface of the small intestine. The biopsy is not painful and is performed by a  pediatric gastroenterologist  while a child is sedated.   ​Other testing may include additional blood work for other antibodies such as deamidated gliadin IgG and endomysial IgA. Genetic testing may also be performed by taking a swab of the cheek; this is done in certain circumstances if the diagnosis of celiac disease is not certain.  For a wheat allergy:  Blood tests or  skin- prick tests  can be done to see if there is an elevated wheat IgE blood level or a skin reaction to the presence of wheat antigen on the skin.  For non-celiac gluten sensitivity:  There are no accurate tests available for evaluating.  A child should continue to eat foods containing gluten until all testing is complete. Starting a gluten-free diet or avoiding gluten before testing may make it difficult to confirm the diagnosis.  What is the treatment for celiac disease? The only available treatment for celiac disease is a strict life-long, gluten-free diet. It is important to limit cross-contamination—even crumbs containing gluten can lead to symptoms and intestinal inflammation. Additionally, gluten may be found in certain medications and in some non-food items such as shampoo and make-up —but these are not harmful unless they are eaten.  Talking to a knowledgeable dietitian can help parents and children make the needed adjustments to a gluten-free lifestyle. Without treatment, children with celiac disease can go on to develop anemia, osteoporosis, and other complications. Is the gluten-free diet healthy? Just because a food is labeled \"gluten-free\" does not mean it is better for you. Therefore, reading labels may not always be the most efficient way to remain healthy and symptom-free.  See  Gluten-Free Food Labeling .   ​ Processed gluten-free foods are not vitamin fortified . For example, they may lack B vitamins and iron and be high in fat and sugar and low in protein.  Eat naturally gluten-free and healthy foods . These include fruits, vegetables, meats and fish, as well as a variety of grains including amaranth, millet and quinoa.  Some children with celiac disease may also need a daily multivitamin . What accommodations can be made for a child with celiac disease? Parents of children who are newly diagnosed with celiac disease will need to speak to their child's teacher or child care provider about the condition, what foods are safe, and what to do in case of inadvertent exposure to gluten. School lunches:  Schools are required by law to provide substitutions to the school meals for children with celiac disease—if their needs are supported by a statement signed by a licensed doctor. The doctor's order may require certain products to be purchased for the child. Schools may not charge children with certified special dietary needs more than they charge other children for program meals or snacks. In other words, children who receive  free lunches  cannot incur any charges for their meals and children who pay full-price cannot be charged extra for the special foods the school must purchase. Classroom management:  Children with a  504 plan  or those who can document their condition are entitled not only to lunch, but to a plan for classroom management of their celiac disease. That might mean young children with celiac will not have access to glue or other gluten-containing art class items they might taste or put in their mouths. It might mean older children will not have field trips where they might encounter gluten, such as a tour of a bread factory.

        "content": "By: Adam Ratner, M.D., M.P.H., FAAP   Cholera is an infection of the intestines caused by bacteria called  Vibrio cholerae . The infection usually spreads through contaminated drinking water or food, such as raw or undercooked shellfish.    In the United States, cholera is rare. Most of the cholera cases that happen in the United States are due to travel. Each year, a handful of cholera cases are reported after travelers return from areas with active cholera transmission. Right now, these areas include parts of Africa, Asia and the Americas. A small number of people have been sickened after eating contaminated seafood from the Gulf coast.    The oral cholera vaccine is recommended for children and adults ages 2 through 64 years who are planning to travel to areas with a current or recent  cholera outbreak . Here's what else families should know about cholera before they travel.    Cholera symptoms  Symptoms of cholera include vomiting and watery  diarrhea  that can range from mild to very severe. An   infection does not always cause symptoms. In most cases, however, there is both vomiting and mild to moderate diarrhea. In about one in 10 infections, the watery diarrhea becomes severe and significant  dehydration  occurs, a condition called cholera gravis. Early signs of dehydration include thirst, dry mouth, sunken eyes and decreased urination. In the most severe cases—especially when lost fluids are not replaced—very serious complications can develop, including  seizures , shock and coma. If dehydration from cholera is not treated, it can be fatal. Seek medical care if your child or you  develop symptoms  of watery diarrhea that occur within 5 days after travel.    How cholera is diagnosed & treated  Laboratory tests can detect the presence of  V .  cholerae  bacteria in the child's poop.  Children with  dehydration  due to cholera need to be rehydrated right away. This can usually be done with  solutions  given by mouth that are available over the counter. For children who are moderately to severely ill, intravenous (IV) fluids are necessary.  Antibiotic  medications, such as doxycycline, ciprofloxacin or azithromycin, can decrease the amount of bacteria in the poop and shorten the duration of the diarrhea. Antidiarrheal medicines should not be used for cholera.  How to prevent cholera  Vaccination, hand hygiene and food and water safety precautions can help keep children safe when visiting an area with active cholera transmission.  The bacteria can be killed by boiling, filtering or treating water with chemicals such as chlorine or iodine. Fish, shellfish, rice, grains and other foods that may have been  contaminated  by  V. cholerae  should be fully cooked or reheated to destroy the bacteria.  To keep food from spoiling, refrigerate leftover cooked seafood as soon as possible. Fruits and vegetables should be peeled before eating. They should not be purchased already peeled, as they may become contaminated after peeling. Parents planning to bring children to an area with active cholera transmission should discuss cholera vaccination with their pediatrician.

        "content": "By: Patrick T. Reeves, MD, FAAP & Christine Waasdorp Hurtado, MD, MSCS, FAAP\t Constipation  is a common problem in children. In fact, roughly    1 in every 20 visits  children make to a doctor are because of constipation. Children with constipation may have stools (poops or bowel movements—BMs) that are hard, dry and difficult or painful to get out. Some children with constipation have infrequent stools.  Read on for more information about constipation (signs and symptoms, causes and treatment) and how to help your child develop good bowel habits. \t   What is normal pooping? An important milestone in the life of a child is learning to poop in the toilet. Different children poop different amounts and number of times each day. Some poop one time a day and others may go after every meal (three or so times per day).  The most important aspect of pooping is the character (or \"softness\") of the poop. You can use the    Pediatric Bristol Stool Form Scale for Children  (see below) to determine if your child's poops are the correct softness. The goal is to poop a Type 3 or a Type 4 on the scale.\t \t \t Image courtesy Patrick T. Reeves, MD, FAAP, adapted from Lane et al.  Types of constipation in children There are two main types of constiptation: organic and functional. Organic constipation Organic constipation is a fancy way of describing when painful poops occur because of a disease. These types of constipation are very rare and might include celiac disease, thyroid problems or other    disorders .  Functional constipation Most children have    functional  constipation. It can happen when children hold back bowel movements. It also can happen after a child has had a gastrointestinal infection.   \t Stool withholding Functional constipation usually results from withholding behaviors: a fear of pain or discomfort from pooping, or a lack of awareness of the body's signs for needing to poop, have led to significant discomfort for the child. For example: Your child may try not to go because it hurts to pass a hard stool. ( Diaper rashes  can make this worse.)  Children aged 2 to 5 years may want to show they can decide things for themselves. Holding back their stools may be their way of taking control. This is why it is best not to push children into    toilet training . Sometimes children don't want to stop playing to go to the bathroom. Older children may hold back their stools when away from home (such as camp or school). They may be afraid of or not like using public toilets.\t Post-infectious constipation It is important to note that some children may develop functional constipation after a gastrointestinal illness (diarrhea stomach \"bug\" or stomach flu). This is known as post-infectious functional constipation. What happens if constipation gets worse?   Sometimes, a withholding cycle—when the child holds in the poop day after day—can cause more severe symptoms like:  intense abdominal pain (stomach aches) or bloating  decreased appetite  nausea or  reflux   diarrhea from bowel overflow What is encopresis? When poop overflows like diarrhea because of constipation, we call this    encopresis . Encopresis can be very alarming to children and parents because it can look like diarrhea caused by infections. However, it is actually the child's body attempting to evacuate a large amount of poop.  What are other signs of constipation a parent can look for? Anal fissures The large, rocky hard poops caused by constipation can cause injury to the skin around the rectum and anus when a child finally has a poop. This can lead to pain with pooping, but the hard poops can also tear the skin around the rectum. This can cause bleeding. Most often, the blood loss is minimal and only noticed when blood is seen on the toilet paper after wiping.  Fecal streaking Sometimes children have already developed constipation and are becoming backed up, but have not yet reached the point of encopresis. When this happens, sometimes passing gas (farting/ flatulence) can lead to small streaks/chunks of poop smearing in the underwear, known as fecal streaking. How is constipation treated?   Many treatments and strategies exist to help children manage their constipation. While some of these medicines are over the counter, we recommend that you discuss any treatments with your child's doctor before starting. Let's look at some of these options:    Diet There is no specific \"constipation diet\" that has been shown to be effective in preventing or treating constipation. However, increasing water intake and the use of natural fibers from fruits and vegetables are a healthy option that can be recommended to children.     Hydration Making sure that children    drink enough water  every day is crucial to many bodily functions. When the body does not get enough water, it becomes dehydrated and takes water from the gut and pushes it to other important places in the body, like the heart. This can be what starts the cycle to make poops harder. Increasing a child's water intake without medicines is not an effective treatment for constipation.   Fiber There are many sources of fiber including from foods and supplements. Food-based, natural fibers are recommended over supplements. Many fruits that children enjoy-like kiwi- are higher in fiber content. These options can be a healthy, important portion of the child's diet.\t \t  Eat 5!  A simple way to make sure your child is getting enough fiber is by making healthful food choices. If your child is eating at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day along with other foods that are good sources of fiber, there is really no need to count fiber grams.\t Add 5!  If you find it helpful to keep track of total grams of fiber that your child is eating, add 5 to your child's age. For example, a 5-year-old would need about 10 grams of fiber each day. (The total daily recommended amount of up to 25 grams for adults can be used as a general guideline for children.) Some foods are high in fiber. Beans, vegetables, fruits and whole grains are good sources of fiber.\t Can fiber supplements make constipation worse? It is important to note that fiber supplements taken without enough    water  can worsen your child's constipation! Pre/probiotics\t   There is not enough research to support the use of these therapies for children with constipation.    Change toilet posture Children sometimes have bad posture on the toilet: they slump at the waist and do not sit up straight, they cross their legs, their legs dangle in the air or they clinch their bottom cheeks together. One tool to improve toilet posture is the defecation posture modification device, a potty stool. This kind of stool can improve toileting posture by promoting the relaxation of the puborectalis muscle and straightening of the \"ano-rectal\" angle to make passing a poop easier. A    recent study  showed that the potty stool is safe and effective (when used with medicines) to treat functional constipation in toilet-trained children.    Laxative medicines There are many laxative medicines available to treat children with functional constipation including stool softeners, osmotic laxatives, stimulant laxatives, secretagogue laxatives and rectal therapies.\t Stool softeners  Examples include docusate sodium. These medications attempt to bring water that is already nearby, but outside of the poop, into the poop to make it softer and easier to expel.\t Osmotic laxatives  Examples include polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG), PEG 4000, Milk of Magnesia (magnesium hydroxide), and Magnesium Citrate. These medications attract more water to the colon to ease, hydrate, and soften poop. PEG 3350 is the recommended osmotic laxative to be used in infants and children. Recently, there has been non-scientific, sensationalized media about the concerns for association of PEG 3350. The latest    evidence  shows:  PEG 3350 does not cause autism spectrum disorders PEG 3350 is safe in infants, toddlers, children and adults and does not cause increased levels of glycol in the body,  Children do not develop a dependence on PEG 3350 or other osmotic laxatives. \t Stimulant laxatives Examples include: senna (and other sennokot plant derivates), bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate (not sold in United States). These medications work by stimulating the muscles of the colon, the organ that holds the poop, to flex and push poop out of the body. The    evidence  shows that stimulant laxatives are safe in children. Children do not develop a dependence after short-term or long-term use of stimulant laxatives.   \t Secretagogue laxatives These are highly specialized medications that should be used by pediatric gastroenterologists. They are not approved for use in children by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. When recommended by your gastroenterologist, these medications are \"off label.\"\t Rectal therapies Rectal therapies include suppositories (which give medicine directly to the rectum) and enemas (which given medicine higher into the colon to provide additional hydration, lubrication or stimulation to evacuate poop). Evidence shows that enemas are equally effective for fecal disimpaction (a \"cleanout\") as PEG 3350, but should not be used as the first choice for daily (maintenance) therapies. Constipation action plans  There is    research  showing that children and parents benefit from receiving a    Constipation Action Plan  at the time of diagnosis. These plans help parents understand what amounts (doses) of medicines to give at what times, and, if need be, to give larger doses in response to worsening symptoms.   How long does my child need to take their medicines for constipation?   Some children may need a medical disimpaction (or cleanout) before starting maintenance therapy. If this is the case, there is a 3-step process to treatment:  Step 1:  The initial cleanout  removes the backed-up poop from the body. Usually this requires much higher doses of the medicine (such as PEG 3350) over the course of 1-4 days before going to a lower daily dose. The goal of Step 1 is to produce diarrhea because we are evacuating the buildup of poop. The diarrhea will stop when the cleanout is completed.   Step 2:  Maintenance (daily) therapy  prevents stool build-up by keeping stool soft thus cutting down on withholding behavior and allowing the colon to return to its normal shape and muscle tone. During this step, it is important to encourage regular bowel movements in the toilet.   Step 3:  Counseling and behavior modifications  may help children who are embarrassed or feel they are \"bad\" because of the soiling. A counselor can help structure the treatment plan and help the child cooperate.\t Constipation should be treated with maintenance medications for at least 2 months. After the 2-month period is completed, the child should be treated for at least 1 additional month while they are asymptomatic. Constipation while potty training Children can become constipated during  toilet training . If this happens, your child should CONTINUE toilet training and take their medicines until toilet training is completed and they have been free of symptoms for one additional month.   What if all of these options fail?   In rare cases, children with functional constipation can undergo more testing to determine if the brain and nerves of the gut are working appropriately. The most common test for this is performed by pediatric gastroenterologists and is known as anorectal manometry. This testing can be done when the child is awake but can be associated with some discomfort. In addition, there are highly specialized therapies that can be used by pediatric gastroenterologists and pediatric surgeons if the above medications by mouth strategies fail. Please ask your gastroenterologist about these options. Remember If you have any questions or concerns about your child's health, talk with your child's doctor.

        "content": "When children suddenly get loose, watery and more frequent bowel movements, they have diarrhea. Diarrhea is a common symptom of illness in young children. In the United States, children younger than 4 years may have diarrhea 1 or 2 times each year.    Here are some questions you may have if your child has diarrhea, tips to help manage it, and when to call the doctor. What's the best way to treat or manage diarrhea?\t Mild diarrhea without vomiting.  Diarrhea often goes away in a couple of days on its own. Most children with mild diarrhea do not need to change their diet and electrolyte solutions are usually not needed. You can keep giving human (breast) milk, formula, or cow's milk. However, if your child seems bloated or gassy after drinking formula or cow's milk, ask your child's doctor if these should be avoided.\t Mild diarrhea with vomiting.  Children who have diarrhea and are vomiting will need to stop their usual diets. Electrolyte solutions should be given in small amounts, often until the vomiting stops. In most cases, they're needed for only 1 to 2 days. Once the vomiting has lessened, slowly return to your child's usual diet. Some children are not able to tolerate cow's milk when they have diarrhea and it may briefly be removed from the diet by your child's doctor. Breastfeeding should continue.\t Severe diarrhea.  Call your child's doctor for severe diarrhea. Children who have a watery bowel movement every 1 to 2 hours, or more often, and signs of dehydration may need to stop eating for a short period (such as 1 day or less) to focus on drinking to replenish fluid lost in those stools. They need to avoid liquids that are high in sugar, high in salt, or very low in salt (ie, water and tea). For severe dehydration, children may need to be given fluids through the vein (IV) in the emergency department. Diarrhea and dehydration Children with viral diarrhea have a fever and may    vomit . Soon after these symptoms appear, children get diarrhea. The most important part of treating diarrhea is to prevent your child from becoming dehydrated. \t Call your child's doctor right away if your child shows any signs and symptoms of dehydration (see \t   here ) . \t Also, call your pediatrician if your child has diarrhea and: Fever that lasts longer than 24 to 48 hours Bloody stools Vomiting that lasts more than 12 to 24 hours Vomit that looks green, tinged with blood, or like coffee grounds Abdomen (stomach, belly) that looks swollen Will not eat or drink Severe abdominal (stomach, belly) pain Rash or jaundice (yellow color of skin and eyes) Does my child need electrolyte solutions? Most children with mild diarrhea do not need electrolyte solutions. Electrolyte solutions are very helpful for the home management of moderately severe diarrhea. Electrolyte solutions are special fluids that have been designed to replace water and salts lost during diarrhea. Soft drinks (soda, pop), soups, juices, sports drinks, and boiled milk have the wrong amounts of sugar and salt and may make your child sicker.\t Do not try to prepare your own electrolyte solutions at home.  Use only commercially available fluids—store brand and name brand work the same. Your child's doctor or pharmacist can tell you what products are available. Should my child with diarrhea fast (not eat)? Fasting is not a treatment for diarrhea. However, some children may benefit from reducing their intake of solid food if they are vomiting. It is appropriate to continue to offer small amounts of fluids, particularly electrolyte solutions, in these cases. As children recover, it is fine to let them eat as much or as little of their usual diet as they want. Does the BRAT diet help? The bananas, rice, applesauce, toast (BRAT) diet, once recommended while recovering from diarrhea, is no longer considered useful. Because BRAT diet foods are low in fiber, protein, and fat, the diet lacks enough nutrition to help a child's gastrointestinal tract recover. Some pediatricians believe that it may actually make symptoms last longer. Ideally, children can resume eating a normal, well-balanced diet appropriate for their age within 24 hours of getting sick. That diet should include a mix of fruits, vegetables, meat, yogurt, and complex carbohydrates. What about antidiarrheal medicines? Over-the-counter antidiarrheal medicines are not recommended for children younger than 2 years. They can also be harmful in older children. Always check with your child's doctor before giving your child any medicine for diarrhea. Also, do not give your child homemade remedies. Some may not be effective and some may actually make things worse. Do probiotics help diarrhea? Probiotics are types of \"good\" bacteria that live in the intestines. They may have beneficial health effects with regard to diarrhea, although more studies are needed. How can I reduce my child's risk of diarrhea? Most diarrhea in children is caused by viruses. Diarrhea can also be caused by bacteria, parasites, changes in diet (such as drinking too much fruit juice), problems with the intestines (such as allergy to foods), and the use of some medicines. Here are some ways to help prevent diarrhea:\t Stop germs from spreading.  Wash hands frequently with soap or using a hand sanitizer. Try to keep your child away from children who have diarrhea or are vomiting.\t Do not give your child raw (unpasteurized) milk or foods that may be contaminated.\t Avoid medicines, especially antibiotics, if they are not needed.\t Breastfeed your baby. \t Breast milk  has many substances that formulas don't have that help protect your baby from many diseases and infections. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding as the sole source of nutrition for your baby for about 6 months. When you add solid foods to your baby's diet, continue breastfeeding until at least 12 months. You can continue to breastfeed after 12 months if you and your baby desire.\t Limit the amount of juice and sweetened drinks.\t Make sure your child has received the rotavirus vaccine. The    rotavirus vaccine  protects against the most common cause of diarrhea and vomiting in infants and young children. More information\t Diarrhea\t Vomiting with Diarrhea",

        "content": "By: Price T. Edwards, MD & Patrick Reeves, MD, FAAP Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs) are the most common condition seen by pediatric gastroenterologists (digestive system doctors). FAPDs affect one in four children across the world. The disorders may be chronic, with ongoing abdominal pain, or cause stomachaches that come and go.  FAPDs in children typically have no clear cause. They fall under a type of diagnosis called disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBIs). Constant communication exists between our brain and the nerves, which may cause pain in our gastrointestinal tract (GI) and the rest of our body.  FAPDs do not develop over the course of one day. It can take months or even years for a disorder to develop. Continue reading to learn about the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment for FAPDs in children. Symptoms of functional abdominal pain disorders  Most children with FAPDs will have pain at or around the belly button. Other more concerning symptoms can occur with FAPDs may include:  Nausea/vomiting \t Headaches Dizziness Tiredness Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) or odynophagia (painful swallowing)  gastrointestinal bleeding Nighttime    diarrhea Skin changes around the bottom Involuntary weight loss Deceleration of linear growth, a slowing down of gain in a child's height or length Delayed puberty Unexplained/recurrent fever  Arthritis or inflamed joints If your child has abdominal pain accompanied by any of these symptoms, or if you have a family history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis or Crohns disease,  celiac disease  or peptic ulcer disease, contact their doctor. These signs will need further testing and you may be referred to a  pediatric gastroenterologist . What causes gut-brain interaction & functional abdominal pain disorders in children? The cause of pain from FAPDs and DGBIs is unknown, but    research  suggests it can be associated with:\t Stressful events , like a move or family separation Changes to the bacteria that live in the gut (gut    microbiome ) Dysregulated autonomic nervous system, which controls digestion and and other automatic body functions such as heart rate Family history of DGBIs, which suggests that genetics could play a role.\t Disordered movement  of the GI tract, when normal rhythmic contractions that move food and waste through your digestive system become irregular How are DGBIs & FAPDs diagnosed & treated? Typically, FAPDs require diagnosis and treatment from a doctor, and many children may feel better within a few days to a few weeks. DGBIs are diagnosed through the evaluation of your child's symptoms by their doctor. There are different conditions that share symptoms, and a diagnosis will vary between children. One child may benefit from further testing while another child may not. Each child is different, so evaluating your child's symptoms may be the best way for their doctor to reach a diagnosis. Talk to your pediatrician to better understand your child's health. Treatments typically depend on your child's symptoms and the type of DGBI they have. DGBIs can add stress and negatively impact quality of life for patients. The goal of many treatments is to reduce and manage symptoms so patients can stay involved in life activities.  Treatments for DGBIs and FAPDs include:\t Child psychology or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).   Studies  suggest that both in-person and virtual use of CBT can be effective in treating FAPDs. Hypnosis and biofeedback training can also be effective    treatments .\t Finding dietary triggers.  It may be helpful to keep a journal to track foods that cause pain and symptoms of FAPDs. Some patients with IBS may respond well to less    FODMAPs , or foods with high levels of poorly digested sugars. Consult your pediatrician about the low-FODMAP diet for your child.  Medications.  Medication use will vary depending on which DGBI has been diagnosed. For functional abdominal pain related to intestinal spasm,  antispasmodic medicines  are frequently used.  Peppermint oil  has also been shown to have an antispasmodic effect. Some medication may be prescribed to prevent episodes of FAPDs.   One study found  probiotics  helpful for FAPDs and irritable bowel disease. There is ongoing research into additional medication to treat and prevent DGBIs.\t Acupunture & medical devices for FAPDs.  Some treatments use auricular (ear/hearing) acupuncture with small needles. There are also devices being developed that use electrical stimulation that can treat FAPDs.

        "content": "By: Meghan Horn, MD, FAAP & Christine Waasdorp Hurtado, MD, FAAP When your child is throwing up ( vomiting ), it's easy for them to become    dehydrated . The risk is even greater when    fever  causes them to sweat more or they are also losing fluid through    diarrhea . Depending on how severe or how long the vomiting lasts, your child may lose important electrolytes such as sodium, potassium and chloride.  If your child is otherwise healthy, missing a meal or two when they're nauseous and vomiting won't hurt them. However, it's important to make sure they keep getting fluids to help avoid dehydration. Read on for tips to help keep your child hydrated at home when they're sick. What causes vomiting? Vomiting is a common symptom with many childhood illnesses. It happens when the abdominal muscles and diaphragm contract, while the stomach relaxes. This reflex happens when the body's \"vomiting center\" is triggered. This reflex is the body's way of protecting itself against toxins, being harmfully full and other gastrointestinal, neurologic, hormonal and psychiatric triggers. What is the best way to prevent dehydration in my child? Oral rehydration therapy is an effective and safe method for preventing dehydration at home.    For the first 24 hours or so, consider limiting solid foods and encourage them to suck or drink small amounts of fluids every few minutes over a few hours.  The goal should be having them take in at least 1 ounce (30ml) per hour. Liquids help to prevent dehydration and are less likely than solid foods to trigger further vomiting. How to give liquids You can give your child liquid with age-appropriate bottle or cup. If your child cannot sip from a bottle or cup, try using a medicine cup, syringe or teaspoon. What kind of fluids should I be giving my child? 6 months to 1 year: undiluted breast milk or formula. If not tolerated, consider a commercial rehydration solution that contains sugars and salts. Do not use water. 1 year and older:  commercial    oral rehydration solutions  (liquid form and popsicles) diluted apple juice or sports drink (half water/ half drink) Note: Be careful with  commercial sports drinks . They replace salts, but they can also contain large amounts of  sugar , which can make diarrhea worse.   When to call your pediatrician\t Call your child's doctor right away  if your child is too sick to drink, becomes lethargic, or shows any    signs and symptoms of dehydration . These include: urinating less frequently (for infants, fewer than 6 wet diapers daily) dry tongue and inside of mouth  dry eyes and fewer tears when crying  excessive sleepiness or fussiness wrinkled skin in babies, a sunken \"soft spot\" on their head in older children, weakness dizziness when trying to stand Why are babies & young children at greater risk of dehydration? Young children are especially prone to dehydration. This is because their bodies are less efficient at conserving water than older children and adults. In addition, their small size means that it takes less fluid loss to lead to dehydration. Remember Talk with your pediatrician any time you are concerned about your child's health.

        "content": "By: Alexis J. Gumm, MD, FAAP Fatty liver disease happens when triglycerides, a specific kind of fat, build up in the liver. Over time, this can lead to liver damage. In the past, fatty liver disease was considered an adult disease. But it has become much more common in children and teens. In fact, it is now the most frequent cause of liver disease worldwide. Here's what parents need to know. Are some kids at increased risk of fatty liver disease? Children and teens are at increased risk of fatty liver disease if they have: Body mass index ( BMI ) above the 85th percentile Central    obesity , the build-up of fat focused around the abdomen Insulin resistance, when the body has trouble using the hormone insulin to control blood sugar Prediabetes or Type 2    diabetes  (once called adult-onset or non-insulin dependent diabetes) Abnormal levels of blood lipids, including cholesterol and other fat-like substances Metabolic syndrome , insulin resistance that is associated with high blood pressure, high triglyceride levels, obesity and in some cases, irregular menstrual periods in females Sleep apnea , repeated disruption of normal breathing during sleep) Family history of fatty liver disease Asian-American and Hispanic children are also at increased risk of fatty liver disease. What are the signs & symptoms of fatty liver disease in children? Most people with fatty liver disease do not have any symptoms at all. Occasionally, kids may experience pain in the upper-right part of their abdomen. This sort of  abdominal pain  typically is not caused by fatty liver disease, but it sometimes prompt testing that may show fatty liver disease. Fatty liver disease is usually diagnosed after routine labs tests your child's doctor orders at  checkups  raise concern. What kind of tests can diagnose fatty liver disease? Your doctor may order the following tests that can help diagnose fatty liver disease: Blood tests An  ultrasound , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ), magnetic resonance  elastography  (MRE) or vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) to look at the liver A liver  biopsy  might be ordered by your child's doctor to diagnose fatty liver disease. How to treat fatty liver disease in children Fatty liver disease is best treated with    lifestyle  changes: cutting back on processed sugars and fats in the diets and increasing daily    exercise .  What happens if fatty liver disease isn't treated? As fat builds up in the liver over time, this can lead to liver scarring. Over many years, this eventually can lead to liver failure. It is the most common cause of liver transplants in adults.    Remember Talk with your child's pediatrician if you have any questions or concerns about your child's health.

        "content": "​​​Each year, roughly 48 million people in the United States get food poisoning (also called  foodborne illness ). It happens when germs such as viruses, bacteria and parasites, or toxins (poisons) produced by them, get into foods we eat.  Foods can become contaminated with harmful  microbes  before you buy them, or at home if they aren't handled or cooked properly. As a result, food poisoning can affect individual families, or may be part of larger  outbreaks . Here's what you should know. Symptoms of food poisoning The symptoms of food poisoning often seem like those from other intestinal illnesses: abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. But if your child and other people who have eaten the same food all have the same symptoms, the problem is more likely food poisoning. Some of the germs and other sources of food poisoning include:   Salmonella\t   Salmonella  bacteria (there are many types) are a major cause of food poisoning in the United States. The most commonly contaminated foods are raw meat (including chicken), raw or undercooked eggs, and  unpasteurized milk . Fortunately,  Salmonella  are killed when food is cooked thoroughly. Symptoms caused by  Salmonella  infection usually start between six to 48 hours after eating, and may last for 7 days. Infant formula alert:  In February 2022, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration issued an alert about  powdered infant formula​  that may be contaminated with  Cronobacter  and  Salmonella  bacteria. Contact your pediatrician and get immediate medical care  if your baby has symptoms of  Cronobacter  or  Salmonella  infection. These may include poor feeding, irritability,  temperature​  changes,  jaundice​ , grunting breaths, abnormal movements, lethargy, rash or blood in the urine or stool. To check if your powdered formula is part of the recall , enter the product lot code on the bottom of your package on the company's  website​ .  For more information, se e  Ask the Pediatrician: What should I know about the infant formula recall? E. coli\t   Escherichia coli  (or    E. coli ) is a group of bacteria that normally live in the intestines of children and adults. A few strains of these bacteria can cause food-related illnesses. Undercooked ground beef is a common source of    E. coli , although raw produce and contaminated water have caused some outbreaks.  Symptoms of an    E. coli  infection typically include diarrhea (which can range from mild to severe), abdominal pain, and in some cases nausea and vomiting. Some    E. coli  outbreaks have been severe and have even caused deaths in rare instances. The best treatment for an    E. coli –related illness is to get plenty of rest and fluids. But if symptoms are more severe, talk with your pediatrician. Staphylococcus aureus (Staph) Staphylococcus aureus  contamination is a leading cause of food poisoning. These bacteria ordinarily cause skin infections, such as pimples or boils. They can be transferred when foods when handled by someone who is infected. When food is not kept hot enough, staph bacteria multiply and produce a toxin that ordinary cooking will not destroy. The symptoms begin one to six hours after eating the contaminated food, and usually lasts about a day. Clostridium perfringens\t Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens)  is a type of bacteria often found in soil, sewage, and the intestines of humans and animals. It usually is transferred by someone handling food to the food itself, where it multiplies and produces its toxin.    C. perfringens  often is found in school cafeterias. This is because it thrives in food that is served in large amounts and left out for long periods at room temperature or on a steam table. Foods most often involved are cooked beef, poultry, gravy, fish, casseroles, stews, and bean burritos. The symptoms of this type of poisoning start six to 24 hours after eating, and can last from one to several days. Shigellosis\t   Shigella  infections, or shigellosis, are intestinal infections caused by one of many types of shigella bacteria. These bacteria can be transmitted through contaminated food and drinking water, as well as through poor hygiene in places such as child care centers. The germ invades the lining of the intestine, and can lead to symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, and cramps. Shigellosis and its symptoms usually start one to three days after exposure, and get better two to three days after the start of symptoms. In the meantime, your child should consume extra fluids. Your pediatrician may also recommend a rehydrating solution. In severe cases, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, which can shorten the length and intensity of the infection. Campylobacter\t   Campylobacter  is a type of bacteria that can often found in raw or undercooked chicken, unpasteurized milk or contaminated water. Children with    C ampylobacter  typically have symptoms such as watery (and sometimes bloody) diarrhea, cramps, and fever, about two to five days after consuming contaminated food. To diagnose this infection, your doctor will need a stool sample for laboratory testing.  Campylobacter  infection usually runs its course without formal treatment, other than making sure that your child drinks plenty of fluids to replace those lost from diarrhea. When symptoms are severe, however, your pediatrician may prescribe antibiotics. In most cases, your child will be back to normal in about two to five days. Botulism This is the  rare but serious  food poisoning caused by    Clostridium botulinum . These bacteria normally can be found in soil and water. However, they don't often cause illness because they need very special conditions in order to multiply and produce poison.  Clostridium botulinum  grows best without oxygen and in certain chemical conditions. This is why improperly canned food is most often contaminated, especially low-acid vegetables such as green beans, corn, beets and peas.  Honey also can be contaminated with  Clostridium botulinum  and cause severe illness, particularly in children under one year of age. That is why honey should never be given to an infant before their first birthday. Botulism attacks the nervous system and causes double vision, droopy eyelids, decreased muscle tone, and difficulty in swallowing and breathing. It also can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The symptoms usually develop within 12 to 48 hours and can last weeks to months. In infants, the incubation period may be longer. Without treatment, botulism can be fatal. Even with treatment, it can cause nerve damage. Cryptosporidiosis In very uncommon situations, watery diarrhea, low-grade fever, and abdominal pain may be caused by an infection known as cryptosporidium. This infection is of special concern in children who do not have a normal immune system. Other sources of food poisoning Food poisoning may also be caused by poisonous mushrooms, contaminated fish products, and foods with special seasonings. Young children do not care for most of these foods and so will eat very little of them. However, it still is very important to be aware of the risk. If your child has unusual gastrointestinal symptoms, and there is any chance she might have eaten contaminated or poisonous foods, call your pediatrician.  Treatment for food poisoning Most children with food-borne illnesses will get better on their own after a brief break from eating and drinking. Infants can tolerate three to four hours without food or liquids; older children, six to eight. If your child is still vomiting or her diarrhea has not decreased significantly during this time, be sure to call your pediatrician. Also notify the doctor if your child: Shows signs of    dehydration Has bloody    diarrhea Has diarrhea with high fever (over 102°F) Has continuous diarrhea with a large volume of water in the stool, or diarrhea alternating with constipation May have been poisoned by mushrooms Suddenly becomes weak, numb, confused, or restless, and feels tingling, acts drunkenly, or has hallucinations or difficulty breathing  Treatment depends on your child's condition and the type of food poisoning. Tell the doctor the symptoms your child is having, what foods she has eaten recently, and where they got them. If your child is dehydrated, fluid replacement is key. Sometimes antibiotics are helpful, but only if the specific bacteria are known. Antihistamines help if the illness is from an allergic reaction to a food, toxin, or seasoning. If your child has botulism, they will need hospitalization and intensive care.  Remember Fortunately, food contamination and food poisoning can be prevented with some basic guidelines.  (See \" Food-Borne Illness Prevention .\")  Talk with your pediatrician if you have any concerns about food poisoning, what to do if you notice symptoms, and ways to prevent food-borne illness.

        "content": "​​By: Eveline Shue, MD, FAAP​ Roughly one in five adults have gallbladder disease. Gallbladder problems such as gallstones are less likely in children and teens, but are becoming more common. Here's what parents need to know. What is gallbladder disease? The gallbladder is an organ located on the right side of the body, under the liver. The liver makes bile, a fluid that helps to digest food. The gallbladder stores the bile. When your child eats, the gallbladder releases bile through ducts that connect it to the intestine.   ​​  G​allbladder disease often happens when bile hardens and forms stones. It may be caused by or related to:​ A high fat diet or            obesity ​ Blood diseases such as            sickle cell anemia,  hereditary spherocytosis or Beta-thalassemia  Other conditions such as Crohn's disease and            cerebral palsy A history of needing IV (intravenous) nutrition Certain medications, such as            birth control pills What problems can gallstones cause? Children with gallstones may have:  Pain from stones in the gallbladder (biliary colic) Infection of the gallbladder (cholecystitis) Stones in the ducts draining the gallbladder that can block the flow of bile (choledocholithiasis) Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)  What are some symptoms of gallstones in children?  Gallstones do not always cause symptoms. However, children with gallstones may have pain in the upper right or middle part of the belly, just below the rib cage. The pain may feel sharp, crampy or dull and spread to the back or right shoulder. It may come and go, getting worse after eating—especially foods high in fat.  If a gallstone blocks a duct, a child may also have: Nausea or vomiting Fever, chills, or sweats\t Jaundice , which causes the whites of the eyes or skin to turn yellow  Can children have gallbladder disease without gallstones? Children sometimes have gallbladder problems that do not result in stones. These may include:\t Acalculous cholecystitis.  Children sometimes develop gallbladder inflammation without gallstones.\t Biliary dyskinesia.  With this condition, the gallbladder has trouble squeezing to release the bile. Usually, children with biliary dyskinesia have no stones in the gallbladder.  What tests will be done to diagnose gallbladder disease? If doctors think your child is having gallbladder problems, they may ask for: Blood tests An ultrasound to look at the gallbladder A magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to get detailed images of the bile ducts A CT scan, usually if blood tests show inflammation or infection of the pancreas A cholescintigraphy or hepatobiliary (HIDA) scan to look for infection or biliary dyskinesia  Note: diagnostic tests such as a cholescintigraphy or HIDA scan can have limited accuracy for non-gallstone gallbladder disease.  What can be done to make my child better?\t ​Observation.  Many parents and kids know what foods will cause gallbladder pain. These foods are often greasy foods or foods that have a lot of fat. Sometimes, pain can be made better by not eating these foods. \t Medicine.  There is currently no reliable medicine to make gallbladder disease go away. \t Surgery.  The only dependable way to fix gallbladder disease is to remove the gallbladder with surgery, a procedure called  cholecystectomy ​. Gallbladder surgery, is usually done laparoscopically, using a video camera and a few tiny cuts or incisions. Your surgeon may recommend a procedure called a cholangiogram if the stones seem to be stuck in the ducts that drain bile into the intestine. This is done during surgery by putting dye into the bile ducts and taking x-rays.  Sometimes there is too much infection around the gallbladder and it is not safe to do the surgery laparoscopically. If this happens, your surgeon may need to do the surgery with one bigger incision.  Remember Regular visits with your child's pediatrician can help avoid gallbladder problems by keeping health conditions that can make them more likely under control.​ More Information Gallbladder Removal Surgery (Cholecystectomy)​ ​ What is a Pediatric Surgeon?

        "content": "​​​​By: Anthony Porto, MD, MPH, FAAP All babies  spit up — and it often seems like everything they just ate comes right back up!  So, how do you know if your spitty baby's symptoms are normal or part of a larger problem? To help you sort it all out, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) answers common questions about typical digestive functioning and explains the differences between gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). What are the differences between GER and GERD?  Without getting too technical, spit-up  (also called reflux, gastroesophageal reflux, or GER)  is the movement of stomach contents into the esophagus, and sometimes through the mouth and nose. When reflux is associated with other symptoms, or if it persists beyond infancy, it is considered a disease and is known as gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD.  GER in infants is not considered a disease and does not include a \"D.\" In fact, GER is considered normal. These infants are known as \"happy spitters,\" because they are not cranky and do not appear to be in a great deal of pain when spitting up. In fact, your baby may feel better after a good spit-up. Other symptoms of GER include mild feeding problems, such as occasional prolonged feeds or interrupted feeds. When is spit-up or GER normal? GER usually begins at approximately 2 to 3 weeks of life and peaks between 4 to 5 months. Most babies who are born at full term will have complete resolution of symptoms by the time they are 9 to 12 months old.  In most babies, GER disappears as the upper digestive tract functionally matures. In addition, normal development, including improved head control and being able to sit up, as well as the  introduction of solid food , will help improve GER symptoms. What are the causes of GER? If your baby's stomach is full or his or her position is changed abruptly, especially after a feeding, the stomach contents—food mixed with stomach acid—press against the valve at the top of the stomach. This is called the  lower esophageal sphincter . This ring of muscle normally relaxes to let food pass from the esophagus into the stomach and then tightens again to keep the food there. When it is not fully developed or it opens at the wrong time, the stomach contents move back or reflux into the esophagus.  See  Why Babies Spit Up  for more information on this.   In older children, diet can play more of a role. Large meals and highly acidic or spicy meals, as well as carbonated or caffeinated beverages, can lead to increased GER symptoms. In addition, GER is more common in children who are overweight or obese.  How do I know if my child has GERD?  Unlike GER, GERD is associated with complications from acid reflux. Call your pediatrician if your child exhibits any of the following signs or symptoms:  Refusal to feed Crying and/or arching the back during feeds (i.e., seems to be in pain)  Blood or greenish color in the spit-up  Increase in frequency or intensity of the spit-up (i.e., forceful) Belly is swollen or distended or feels hard  Respiratory symptoms—including wheezing and coughing In addition, let your pediatrician know if you notice that your baby doesn't seem to be gaining weight or is having fewer wet and dirty diapers, as these may be signs that not enough of what he or she eats is staying down. How will my pediatrician evaluate my baby for GER? The AAP believes it is important for all pediatric health care providers to be able to properly identify and treat children with reflux symptoms, and to distinguish GER from more worrisome disorders to avoid unnecessary costs and treatments. Your child's pediatrician will review your child's symptoms and feeding patterns and assess your child's growth by plotting his or her weight and height on a  growth chart . This information will help them determine whether your child is a \"happy spitter\" or has symptoms of GERD.  How is GER or GERD treated? While we wish we had a \"quick fix\" for babies who spit up, the truth is that for a good many spitty babies, it is mostly a matter of time. Lifestyle changes—including feeding and/or position changes—are recommended as first-line therapy for both GER and GERD. If GERD is severe, treatment may include medication or surgery. The surgery to correct reflux is called  fundoplication . Treatment options during infancy:  Burp at natural pauses in feeding and keeping your child upright for up to thirty minutes after feeding. If your bottle-fed baby spits up unusually often, your pediatrician may recommend thickening his or her formula with a very small amount of baby cereal. Never add solids to the bottle unless your pediatrician advises it. S ee  Oatmeal: The Safer Alternative for Infants & Children Who Need Thicker Food  for more information on this line of treatment.   Consider smaller and more frequent feedings, but be sure your baby is taking in enough to keep up typical growth and development.  Consider keeping your baby in an upright position for the first half hour or so after feeding. Always closely supervise your baby during this time. Regardless of whether or not your baby warrants watchful waiting or medical intervention, the AAP does have additional and simple feeding suggestions that can help you deal with the situation at hand.  See  Remedies for Spitty Babies  for more treatment tips.   Treatment options for an older child:  Avoid fried and fatty foods; they slow down the rate of the stomach emptying and promote reflux.  Peppermint,  caffeine , and certain  asthma medications  can make the lower esophageal sphincter relax and allow stomach contents to reflux back into the esophagus. Some experts believe that tomato-based products have a similar effect. If any food seems to produce reflux or heartburn, keep it out of the diet for a week or two and then reintroduce it. If symptoms reoccur, avoid that food until your pediatrician recommends to reintroduce it into the diet. Sometimes your pediatrician may recommend medications that neutralize or decrease the acid in your child's stomach to treat symptoms associated with GERD.  When might my pediatrician refer my child to a pediatric gastroenterologist?  Your pediatrician may refer your child to see a  pediatric gastroenterologist , a pediatrician who has specialized training in problems of the gastrointestinal tract—including GERD—for a variety of reasons including: Poor weight gain Feeding problems No response to medical therapy A pediatric gastroenterologist will review your child's history, examine your child and review his or her diet history and growth charts. Sometimes, it can be helpful for a pediatric gastroenterologist to observe your child being fed or self-feeding. Based on the visit, he or she will decide whether your child may benefit from additional testing or from the addition of or a change in medications.

        "content": "Giardiasis is the name doctors give to infections caused by a microscopic parasite called      Giardia Intestinalis . This organism may be found in the stools of an infected person. It can be transmitted by person-to-person contact in places like child care centers and among family members who have not properly      washed their hands  after using the bathroom or changing      diapers . Giardia may also be present in contaminated food and water and is a risk for      campers  drinking untreated water from mountain streams, which can be contaminated by stool from infected animals and campers. Signs and Symptoms  Most children with a   Giardia  infection have no symptoms at all. A few have   abdominal pain  and watery, foul-smelling   diarrhea  that can lead to dehydration. They may also have excessive gas and bloating and could have a poor appetite, leading to weight loss.   Fever  is uncommon. Most often, symptoms begin 7 to 14 days after exposure to the   Giardia  parasite and can last, without treatment, for about 4 to 6 weeks.   How Is the Diagnosis Made? A stool sample from your child will be examined for the presence of      Giardia Intestinalis . Treatment  To keep your child well hydrated, she should drink plenty of liquids recommended by your pediatrician, such as over-the-counter or homemade oral rehydrating solutions. Your doctor may also prescribe prescription medicines (most commonly, metronidazole, furazolidone, or nitazoxanide) that cure most cases after 5 to 7 days of treatment. ​If your child has Giardia organisms in the stool but does not have symptoms, no treatment is needed.

In fact, these ulcers, called  peptic ulcers,  are most often (although not always) caused by bacteria—specifically, an organism called  Helicobacter pylori.\t H pylori  infections occur at a low rate in children in the United States, but may infect more than 75% of children in developing countries. Although infections increase in frequency as people get older, most children and adults with  H pylori  will never develop an infection. No one is certain how  H pylori  is contracted, but person-to-person contact could play a role, as could transmission through contaminated food and water. The incubation period is also unknown.\t Signs and Symptoms\t When  H pylori  causes an ulcer, the intensity of the symptoms can vary. In some cases, there will be no symptoms at all. Ulcers can cause a burning or gnawing pain in the stomach that may come and go, often happening a few hours after eating, as well as during the night, and then actually subsiding while eating food and drinking water.\t Other symptoms may include:\t   Bloating\t Burping\t Nausea and vomiting\t Loss of appetite\t Weight loss\t Bloody vomit and dark stools from bleeding in the stomach or duodenum\t What You Can Do\t In the past, doctors treated peptic ulcers by recommending a bland diet as well as bed rest. But today, these lifestyle strategies appear to be inappropriate approaches to managing ulcers.\t When to Call Your Pediatrician\t Contact your pediatrician if your child\t   Has burning stomach pain that is worse between meals and in the early morning hours and feels better when he eats\t Has persistent abdominal pain, vomiting, loss of appetite, or weight loss\t Has bloody stools or bloody vomit\t How Is the Diagnosis Made?\t Your pediatrician will take a medical history of your child and may perform some simple tests. Your pediatrician may sometimes refer your child to a specialist to conduct the more complicated and invasive tests needed to make the diagnosis of an  H pylori  infection. These tests include analyzing a small piece of tissue (a biopsy) obtained through a device called an endoscope, which is threaded down the throat to the stomach. The tissue is then examined under the microscope and tested for evidence of  H pylori  infection. Your pediatrician can also look at the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum with x-ray film (an  upper GI series ). There are noninvasive tests that can determine whether bacteria are present by analyzing a child’s blood, stool, or breath. The breath test can detect carbon dioxide released by a product made by  H pylori.\t Treatment\t Doctors only prescribe treatment for  H pylori  infections if they have progressed to an actual ulcer. Combinations of antibiotics such as amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole can be taken by your child to kill the bacteria. Make sure he takes the full course of these antibiotics as directed by your pediatrician. They are usually prescribed in combination with drugs called proton pump inhibitors or histamine receptor blockers that interfere with the production of acid in the stomach.\t What Is the Prognosis?\t An  H pylori  infection increases the risk of developing stomach cancer later in life.\t Prevention\t There is no known way to prevent  H pylori  infections. However, a vaccine that could someday prevent the infection is currently being researched.",

        "content": "By: Michael Narkewicz, MD, FAAP Hepatitis C virus (Hep C or HCV) is a virus that can cause liver disease. Although most children and adolescents recover from the initial phase of HCV infection, 60-80% of them may develop signs of chronic liver infection. This can lead to much more serious liver problems and possibly death. Hepatitis C virus is the cause of approximately 10,000 deaths each year in the    United States . Symptoms of HCV infection Infants and children with HCV infection usually do not have symptoms. For those who develop symptoms, the infection may begin as nothing more than a mild flu-like illness. Some people experience one or more of the following: Body aches, fever, diarrhea or nausea Extreme tiredness Lack of appetite or weight loss Dark yellow urine Light, clay-colored bowel movements Stomach pain, especially in the upper right side of the abdomen Jaundice (yellowing of the whites of the eyes or the skin) Infants with HCV infection may also have an enlarged liver or spleen, grow more slowly, or fail to gain weight.  Is there a test for hepatitis C? Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections have been increasing, including among babies and children. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people get tested for HCV infection during every    pregnancy . And, if you have hepatitis C, your baby should be    tested  as early as 2 months old. See the box below to learn more about HCV tests.    Hepatitis C is curable in more than 95% of cases. \t   Test type\t What does a positive test mean?\t Age for testing\t  \t   Notes HCV antibody test Positive test indicates current or past infection 18 months and up\t In newborns born to a pregnant person with HCV, this test may be falsely positive due to passage of the antibody from pregnant person to the newborn infant HCV vir​us test    Positive test indicates active infection After 2 months of age Can be positive before 2 months of age and not indicate infection\t To diagnose HCV infection, your pediatrician will examine your child and test your child's blood for the virus. If your baby tests positive for hepatitis C, they should be referred to a pediatrician or health care provider who has experience managing hepatitis C. How HCV is spread Hepatitis C virus cannot be spread by touching, hugging or kissing. So, children with HCV infection can participate in all normal childhood activities and should not be excluded from child care or school. However, because it can be spread through contact with blood, parents or children with HCV infection should make sure household items such as toothbrushes, razors, nail clippers, or other items that may contain small amounts of blood, are not shared. For most infants, the infection is passed from pregnant person during childbirth. The risk of infection is about 1 in 20 for the infant. Hepatitis C virus can be spread through sexual contact. Ideally, infected adolescents and young adults should avoid having sex. If they choose to have sex, they are urged to use latex condoms to help prevent the spread of HCV. Hepatitis C can also spread through shared needles. HCV infection can cause liver damage. Anyone with HCV is urged to avoid alcohol, which can speed up damage to their liver. Long-term effects of HCV infection Some children with HCV infection have long-lasting liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis or advanced scarring of the liver. Cirrhosis occurs when the liver cells die and are replaced by scar tissue and fat. The liver eventually stops working and can no longer remove waste from the body. Children and adolescents who develop cirrhosis of the liver because of chronic HCV infection may require a liver transplant to survive. Children infected with HCV are also at risk for other serious diseases, including liver cancer. Current treatments are very effective There is no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C. The good news is that very effective treatments are available. This includes several new drugs for HCV infection for children 3 years old and up that can cure the virus in 95-98% of children and adolescents.

        "content": "By: Christine Waasdorp Hurtado, MD, MSCS, FAAP & Laurie A. McCann, DO  When children have hepatitis, it means that they have an \"inflammation of the liver.\" Hepatitis often is caused by a virus. In the United States, the most common viruses that cause it are hepatitis A, hepatitis B and    hepatitis C . Other viruses can cause hepatitis. Medications, toxins, alcohol use, drugs and other medical problems can cause hepatitis, too.  Here's what parents should know about types of hepatitis, causes, symptoms and how hepatitis is treated.   What to know about the hepatitis outbreak in kids Recently, there have been reports of severe hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) among children that may be associated with a common type of virus called adenovirus. Children in    several U.S. states  and    other countries  have been affected. These cases are very rare. Parents should    ask their pediatrician  if they are concerned about their child's symptoms. Acute & chronic hepatitis: what's the difference?\t Acute hepatitis  occurs in a previously healthy child, without preexisting liver injury.   Leading causes of acute hepatitis in children are due to medications and infections. \t Chronic hepatitis  occurs in children with underlying liver disease.   Children may have signs of advanced liver disease such as cirrhosis, bleeding, fluid build-up and poor weight gain.\t    Common causes of acute hepatitis\t Virus\t How it spreads\t Time between exposure and symptom onset \t Prognosis\t Is there a vaccine available?\t Hepatitis A Contaminated food/drinking water 15-40 days Full recovery is expected Yes\t Hepatitis B Blood, needles, sexual activity 50-180 days 90% of newborns develop chronic infection. 10% of older children develop chronic infection Yes\t Hepatitis C Blood, needles 2-6 months 70-80% of acute infections become chronic New drugs are effective at curing the virus in 95%-98% of children. No\t Hepatitis D Blood, needles, sexual activity Unclear, since it is a co-infection with hepatitis B Rare in the U.S. Makes hepatitis B infection worse No\t Hepatitis E Contaminated food/water 5-60 days Rare in the U.S. Full recovery is expected, but infection may be severe for pregnant people No\t Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) Contact with bodily fluids, especially saliva Weeks-months Common infection that causes mononucleosis (also called mono or the kissing disease) Can cause hepatitis in rare cases Full recovery expected No\t Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Contact with body secretions Weeks-months Very common, over 50% of adults aged 40 have had the virus, which sometimes causes hepatitis Full recovery expected No\t Adenovirus Droplets the air (e.g., coughing or sneezing); contaminated bodies of water – like swimming pools and lakes Days-weeks Common infection, that causes hepatitis in rare cases Full recovery expected No\t   Signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis in children include: Dark urine Light colored stools (pale) Itchy skin Yellow skin or eyes (jaundice) Fatigue Fever >100.4°F Nausea or vomiting Abdominal pain Loss of appetite Joint pain Children may also be symptom free. If you are concerned that your child has any of these symptoms or your child has known contact with someone with active viral hepatitis, call your pediatrician. To diagnose acute hepatitis, your pediatrician may order blood work to check for hepatitis. If the test shows that they have hepatitis, your child may need more blood tests and an abdominal ultrasound. What is the treatment for hepatitis? Treatment depends on the underlying cause of hepatitis. If your child has hepatitis from an infection, treatment generally is supportive: rest, staying well-hydrated and supporting their immune system so it can recover from the virus. Talk with your pediatrician before giving your over-the-counter medicine for pain or fever because medicines like acetaminophen (Tylenol) may cause problems. If hepatitis is caused by a medication, then talk to your pediatrician about stopping that medication. Rarely, if liver inflammation is severe, it can cause liver failure which may require a liver transplant. What are the long-term effects of hepatitis? Most children with hepatitis due to viruses or medications recover fully. Although uncommon, chronic hepatitis can occur with hepatitis B or C infections, or if due to an underlying disease and the child will need to be monitored by a doctor. How do I prevent hepatitis? There are vaccines to protect children from two of the common virus types:    hepatitis A and hepatitis B . \t The hepatitis B vaccine  (3-dose series) is given to infants at birth and twice again over the next several months. The Hepatitis B vaccine also protects against Hepatitis D, as you cannot develop hepatitis D unless a hepatitis B infection is present. \t The hepatitis A vaccine  (2-dose series) is recommended for infants once they are 12 months old. The hepatitis A vaccine is especially important because there are areas of the country with high hepatitis A infection rates and for anyone traveling to areas where it spreads.  Here are other ways to prevent or avoid hepatitis:\t While eating and drinking: \t Wash hands  with soap and clean water for at least 20 seconds when preparing food and drinks. Hepatitis spreads through food, making frequent hand washing during meal preparation especially important for children and caregivers. Don't share utensils or food, and avoid contaminated food and water.\t At daycare:  Check that your child's    daycare  center practices good hand washing, especially with diaper changes and food preparation. \t Before traveling to other countries:  Ask your pediatrician about the risk of hepatitis and what precautions to take. In some instances, your pediatrician may recommend a hepatitis A vaccine before traveling.\t At home:  Keep    medications  locked and out of reach from children, and always    check the label  and dosing instructions before giving medicine to your infant or child.

        "content": "After a baby's feeding, many new parents quickly learn, some of what goes down often comes back up. While occasional dribbles of spit-up after meals is common in infants and usually harmless, true vomiting is more concerning. In some babies, frequent projectile vomiting can be a symptom of a condition called hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS); it occurs in 1 out of every 500 or so babies. What is hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS)? Pyloric stenosis is a narrowing of the pylorus―a muscular valve at the bottom of the stomach. When it becomes too thick ( hypertrophied),  breastmilk or formula can't get through to the small intestines. This leads to excessive, projectile vomiting. Symptoms of pyloric stenosis Infants with pyloric stenosis have a hard time keeping anything down after feedings―usually starting between 2 and 8 weeks of age. Signs your baby may have hypertrophic pyloric stenosis\t Vomiting after every feeding or only after some feedings.  Because breastmilk or formula is blocked from passing through the stomach, the baby throws up—sometimes forcefully enough to launch their stomach contents several feet away! The vomiting may gradually get worse as the pylorus muscle thickens.\t Hungry all the time.  Babies with pyloric stenosis may be hungry still (or again) after vomiting. It may seem like they are always hungry.\t Tummy tightening.  After feedings, you may notice waves of contractions ripple across the top of your baby's abdomen, from left to right, as the stomach tries to push food through the pylorus.\t Constipation.  Because pyloric stenosis prevents what babies eat from reaching the intestines, they may become    constipated .\t Dehydration and weight loss.  Babies with pyloric stenosis do not get enough fluids and nutrients from feedings and may become dangerously dehydrated. They may have trouble gaining weight as they grow, or even lose weight.    See \t   Signs of Dehydrations in Infants & Children  for more information.\t Be sure to talk with your pediatrician right away if your baby is vomiting a lot. How is pyloric stenosis diagnosed? Your doctor may diagnose pyloric stenosis by examining your baby's tummy to feel the thick pylorus muscle―an olive-shaped mass in the upper belly, which is the abnormal pylorus. Imaging tests may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis: \t Ultrasound  can be used to take a picture of the pylorus, which will be thicker and longer than normal. An ultrasound can also show when milk or formula does not pass out of the stomach into the small intestine.\t Upper gastrointestinal contrast study  (or \"upper GI\"), an X-ray test, is sometimes done. In an upper GI, your baby drinks a liquid that lights up on X-ray. As with ultrasound, if your baby has pyloric stenosis, the upper GI will show only a very small amount of liquid passing through the pylorus. Are some babies more likely to get diagnosed with pyloric stenosis than others? The cause of pyloric stenosis is unknown, but researchers point to possible risk factors:\t Gender.  The condition is four times more common in boys than in girls.\t Race.  Caucasian babies are more likely to develop pyloric stenosis than other races.\t Family history.  Sometimes, pyloric stenosis runs in families. Siblings of children with the condition carry a 30 times greater risk than the general population.\t Early antibiotic use.  Babies given certain antibiotics in the first weeks of life—erythromycin to treat    whooping cough , for example—have an increased risk of developing pyloric stenosis. Additionally, babies born to mothers who took certain    antibiotics late in pregnancy  may have an increased risk of developing the condition.\t Smoking during pregnancy.  Babies whose mothers smoked can have nearly double the risk of developing pyloric stenosis.\t Hernias.  Although most infants with pyloric stenosis are otherwise healthy, the condition is seen more often in infants born with    inguinal hernias .\t Bottle-feeding.  Some studies suggest that    bottle-feeding  can raise the risk of pyloric stenosis. But it is not clear whether any rise in risk is related to formula or bottle-feeding itself. Treatment for pyloric stenosis\t Observation . Without treatment, pyloric stenosis will not go away on its own. Once a baby has a hard time keeping anything down, observation alone can result in potentially life-threatening dehydration or malnourishment. \t Medicine . Atropine sulfate is the only currently available medication to treat pyloric stenosis. Using this medication requires staying in the hospital for several weeks and giving the baby special IV nutrition until the vomiting goes away. It does not work 10-25% of the time. For these reasons, it is not widely used and recommended only when surgery would be too dangerous for the baby. \t Surgery . The only dependable way to fix pyloric stenosis is to open the thickened pylorus muscle with  surgery , a procedure called pyloromyotomy. Pyloric stenosis surgery is often done laparoscopically, using a video camera and a few tiny cuts or incisions. Alternatively, it can also be done open with a single longer cut. \t What to expect after your baby's pyloromyotomy surgery After surgery, your baby will be allowed to eat by mouth. Infants should be given breast milk or formula every 3 to 4 hours, starting around 4 to 6 hours after the surgery. Your surgeon will discuss the feeding plan with you after surgery. Know your baby may still have some vomiting, but it usually gets better after a few feedings. Most babies can go home from the hospital within one day after surgery. However, some may stay longer if they are not eating well. After leaving the hospital, your baby can go back to all normal activities, including    tummy time . Once home, be sure you:\t Know how to care for your baby's wound.  Keep surgical cuts on your baby's tummy clean and dry for 3 days. Afterwards, the wounds may be washed with soap and water but not soaked for about 7 days after surgery. Most of the time, the stitches used in children are absorbable and don't need to be taken out. After 3 days, your baby can go back to usual    bath routines . \t Give medicines as directed ―including    infant acetaminophen  if your baby seems uncomfortable.\t Make any needed follow-up appointments.  Your baby's surgeon and pediatrician will want to make sure your baby is eating well, gaining weight, and recovering fully. Be sure to call the doctor if:\t Your baby gets a \t   fever ; this could be a sign of a post-op infection.  In infants, a fever means a rectal temperature reading of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) or higher, or an oral reading of 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37.2 degrees Celsius) or above.\t You're concerned about the incision ―especially if the cuts on your baby's tummy and the skin around them become red, bleed, or start to have yellow or green discharge (see    Staphylococcal Infections ).\t Your baby is \t   vomiting  often or after most meals.\t Your baby's belly appears to be \t   swelling .\t Your baby is not \t   wetting  as many diapers as usual.   Remember Pyloric stenosis is the most frequent surgical condition in infants in the first few months of life. It is important to diagnose pyloric stenosis early, before a baby becomes dehydrated or malnourished. With prompt treatment, babies will soon be able to keep down what they eat so they can grow and thrive.  More information\t Infant Vomiting  \t Treating Vomiting\t Why Babies Spit Up",

        "content": "My baby vomits a lot. Is this a sign of a problem?\t Because many common childhood illnesses can cause vomiting, you should expect your child to have this problem several times during these early years. Usually it ends quickly without treatment, but this doesn’t make it any easier for you to watch. That feeling of helplessness combined with the fear that something serious might be wrong and the desire to do something to make it better may make you tense and anxious. To help put your mind at ease, learn as much as you can about the causes of vomiting and what you can do to treat your child when it occurs. \t Vomiting vs Spitting Up\t First of all, there’s a difference between real vomiting and just spitting up. Vomiting is the forceful throwing up of stomach contents through the mouth. Spitting up (most commonly seen in infants under one year of age) is the easy flow of stomach contents out of the mouth, frequently with a burp. \t Vomiting occurs when the abdominal muscles and diaphragm contract vigorously while the stomach is relaxed. This reflex action is triggered by the “vomiting center” in the brain after it has been stimulated by: \t Nerves from the stomach and intestine when the gastrointestinal tract is either irritated or swollen by an infection or blockage\t Chemicals in the blood (e.g., drugs) \t Psychological stimuli from disturbing sights or smells \t Stimuli from the middle ear (as in vomiting caused by motion sickness) \t Causes of Vomiting\t The common causes of spitting up or vomiting vary according to age. During the first few months, for instance, most infants will spit up small amounts of formula or breastmilk, usually within the first hour after being fed. This “cheesing,” as it is often called, is simply the occasional movement of food from the stomach, through the tube (esophagus) leading to it, and out of the mouth. It will occur less often if a child is burped frequently and if active play is limited right after meals. This spitting up tends to decrease as the baby becomes older, but may persist in a mild form until ten to twelve months of age. Spitting up is not serious and doesn’t interfere with normal weight gain. \t Occasional vomiting may occur during the first month. If it appears repeatedly or is unusually forceful, call your pediatrician. It may be just a mild feeding difficulty, but it also could be a sign of something more serious. \t Persistent Vomiting\t Between two weeks and four months of age, persistent forceful vomiting may be caused by a thickening of the muscle at the stomach exit. Known as hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, this thickening prevents food from passing into the intestines. It requires immediate medical attention. Surgery usually is required to open the narrowed area. The important sign of this condition is forceful vomiting occurring approximately fifteen to thirty minutes or less after every feeding. Anytime you notice this, call your pediatrician as soon as possible. \t GERD\t Occasionally the spitting up in the first few weeks to months of life gets worse instead of better—that is, even though it’s not forceful, it occurs all the time. This happens when the muscles at the lower end of the esophagus become overly relaxed and allow the stomach contents to back up. This condition is known as gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. This condition usually can be controlled by doing the following: \t Thicken the milk with small amounts of baby cereal as directed by your pediatrician. \t Avoid overfeeding or give smaller feeds more frequently. \t Burp the baby frequently. \t Leave the infant in a safe, quiet, upright position for at least thirty minutes following feeding. \t If these steps are not successful, your pediatrician may refer you to a  gastrointestinal (GI) specialist . \t Infection\t After the first few months of life, the most common cause of vomiting is a stomach or intestinal infection. Viruses are by far the most frequent infecting agents, but occasionally bacteria and even parasites may be the cause. The infection also may produce fever, diarrhea, and sometimes nausea and abdominal pain. The infection is usually contagious; if your child has it, chances are good that some of her playmates also will be affected. \t Rotaviruses are a leading cause of vomiting in infants and young children, with symptoms often progressing to diarrhea and fever. These viruses are very contagious, but are becoming less common than in the past, due to the availability of a vaccine that can prevent the disease. The rotavirus is one of the viral causes of gastroenteritis, but other types of viruses—such as noroviruses, enteroviruses, and adenoviruses—can cause it as well.\t Occasionally infections outside the gastrointestinal tract will cause vomiting. These include infections of the respiratory system, infections of the urinary tract otitis media, meningitis , and appendicitis. Some of these conditions require immediate medical treatment, so be alert for the following trouble signs, whatever your child’s age, and call your pediatrician if they occur.\t Blood or bile (a green-colored material) in the vomit\t Severe abdominal pain \t Strenuous, repeated vomiting \t Swollen or enlarged abdomen \t Lethargy or severe irritability \t Convulsions\t Signs or symptoms of dehydration, including dry mouth, absent tears, depression of the \"soft spot\", and decreased urination \t Inability to drink adequate amounts of fluid \t Vomiting continuing beyond twenty-four hours",

        "content": "An inguinal hernia happens near the groin area, between the belly and the thigh. With boys, you can often see a swelling in the scrotum. Does this mean girls are off the hook? Not exactly. While girls may not have testicles, they do have an inguinal canal and can get hernias, too. About 3% to 5% of healthy, full-term babies are born with an inguinal hernia. In  premature  infants, the incidence is substantially increased―up to 30%.   If an inguinal hernia is not treated, it can cause serious problems. Learn more about the signs and symptoms of this condition and what to expect if your child needs hernia repair surgery. What is an inguinal hernia? The story of the inguinal hernia begins during a baby's development. When a baby boy is growing in the womb, the testicles first grow in his belly. As the fetus develops, their testicles travel down a tunnel into the scrotum. (This tunnel also exists in baby girls.) Occasionally, the tunnel (called the    processus vaginalis ) does not close. This leaves an opening from the belly into the inguinal canal, where a piece of bowel or an ovary can become trapped. When this happens, what should stay safely in the abdomen — fluid, intestines, other tissues — can pass through and enter the groin. To avoid potential complications, inguinal hernias require surgery to repair. How do I know if my child has an inguinal hernia?\t   Hernias can occur at any age but are most common in newborns. However, they may not be noticeable for several weeks or months after birth. \t When your child has an inguinal hernia, you can usually see a bulge in the groin and/or scrotum or labia.  The bulge will typically come and go, and is usually soft and squishy. It may get bigger after your child is straining or crying. It may go away or get smaller during the night while your child is asleep or relaxed. (Straining and crying do not cause hernias, despite some myths.) NEVER ignore signs of pain or distress or any bulge in an infant or child. Call your doctor as soon as possible for a professional opinion or go to the emergency room.\t Incarcerated hernia.  If the bulge becomes trapped even when your child relaxes, it may mean that organs from inside the belly are trapped inside the hernia. This is called an \" incarcerated hernia \" and requires immediate medical attention. Your child will likely have pain or feel tenderness (or even have vomiting). The bulge may also become much firmer or even red when this happens.\t Strangulated hernia.  If the blood supply of the contents of the hernia is cut off, it is called a \" strangulated hernia .\" These symptoms include severe pain, vomiting, decreased appetite, redness or bruising around the bulge, and sometimes fevers and bloody stools. What is the difference between an inguinal hernia and a hydrocele? The inguinal hernia is frequently confused with a similar but more benign condition, a    communicating hydrocele . What's the difference? A    hydrocele   is a fluid filled sac in the groin or scrotum. Like hernias, hydroceles occur when there is a patent processus vaginalis, but fluid—not organs—is found in the sac. Hydroceles can look like hernias and also have swelling in the groin and scrotum, and fluid can move back and forth from the scrotum into the belly, leading to a change in size of the scrotum (\"communicating hydrocele\"). Swelling of the hydrocele may cause discomfort but typically it does not.  A hydrocele does not require surgery right away. Most can be watched until 12 to 18 months of age; after that, they are unlikely to resolve on their own. Hydroceles can also become inguinal hernias if solid abdominal contents enter and stretch out the sac, in which case surgery is recommended.    Will any tests need to be done to see if my child has an inguinal hernia?\t Most of the time, a doctor can diagnose an inguinal hernia by what they see when examining your child―seeing a bulge in the groin when your child cries or strains and seeing it disappear when your child relaxes.  When what the doctor sees is different from what you have seen at home, or if the bulge is always there and the doctor is worried that it might be a mass and not a hernia, an    ultrasound  can be done to help make the proper diagnosis. However, ultrasounds are not always necessary. If it is not always obvious to see, it may be helpful to have a picture of your child's hernia when you go to an appointment with the doctor. How is an inguinal hernia treated?\t Surgery is needed to fix the inguinal hernia.  Once a hernia is noticed, your doctor will refer your child to see a    pediatric surgeon  or a    pediatric urologist  for the procedure. Surgery will be scheduled to close the tunnel. The timing of inguinal hernia surgery depends the severity of the symptoms. An incarcerated or strangulated hernia needs to be taken care of immediately. What type of surgery is done to repair the hernia? In hernia repair surgery, the contents of the hernia are pushed back into the abdomen. The inguinal tunnel where the organs are exiting from the belly (hernia) is closed.\t If a laparoscopic (scope) approach is used for the surgery:  Small cuts are made on the belly allowing the scope and instruments to be inserted to see inside the abdomen and repair the hernia.\t If an open surgery is used:  A small incision is made in the groin to repair the hernia.\t If bowel (or another organ) is trapped in the hernia (incarcerated or strangulated):  The surgeon will first ensure that the blood supply to the bowel has not been cut off for too long. If it has, a small piece of bowel may need to be removed and the bowel sewn back together. The hernia is then repaired. Typically, this surgery takes between 30 minutes to 1 hour. What should I expect on the day of the hernia surgery? Before surgery, you will meet the anesthesiologist. Inguinal hernia surgery is typically done under a general anesthetic, although a regional anesthetic can be used. Your child will be asleep during the procedure.    See  Anesthesia and Children: The Day of the Procedure  for more information. As soon as your child wakes up after surgery, someone from the recovery room will call you and you will be able to be with your child again. Your child may have some pain where the incisions were made. Some surgeons inject medicine at that area to control pain. Or, an anesthesiologist may inject medicine in the lower back (\"caudal block\") or in the abdominal nerves that supply the skin over the incision. Your child may also be given pain medicine for you to take at home. When can we go home after surgery? Typically, hernia repair surgery is an outpatient or \"same day\" surgery―meaning your child gets to go home a few hours after recovery. However, if your child has a medical condition or is a premature infant, an overnight stay may be required for observation and safety. When it is safe for your child to go home you will review at-home care with your nurse or doctor. How do I care for my child at home after surgery? Post-surgical home-care instructions can be different depending on the hospital or surgeon, age of the child, and how complex the surgery was. However, some general principles may be similar: Most children can eat a regular diet right after surgery. Recovery time depends on the child. Most can go back to normal, non-strenuous activities in about 1-2 weeks or when they are pain-free. Your child will be restricted from bathing for 2-3 days post-surgery. Your child's surgeon may give you different or more specific instructions. When should I call the doctor's office? You will receive specific instructions for follow-up with the surgeon when your child goes home after surgery. However, here are some key reasons to call: Bleeding or drainage from the incision Redness around the wound(s) Fever above 101 F Vomiting Less peeing than usual or fewer  wet diapers  than usual Pain  that is severe even when taking the pain medications as recommended What problems might my child have as a result of having an inguinal hernia? Having an inguinal hernia in one groin may increase the chance of a hernia on the other side. The surgeon will talk to you about how to care for this possibility. After an inguinal hernia repair, most children do not have problems with this again. But rarely, a hernia can come back. If this happens, a surgeon will need to see your child again. Keep in mind that there are different types of inguinal hernias. Having an inguinal hernia corrected as a child does not mean that your child could not develop a different type of inguinal hernia as an adult, or a hernia on the other side.

        "content": "Irritable bowel syndrome  (IBS) is often referred to inaccurately as “colitis” and “mucous colitis.” But the suffix “ itis ” in a medical condition’s name denotes inflammation, which is not a hallmark of IBS. Rather than inflaming the colon, IBS sensitizes the nerves responsible for the contractions (called  peristalsis ) that propel partially digested food through the organ. As a result, the muscular inner wall overreacts to mild stimuli like milk products and emotional stress, and goes into spasm. Irritable bowel syndrome produces cramplike pains and bouts of diarrhea and/or constipation.\t The more serious disorders, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, are both forms of  inflammatory bowel disease.  IBD damages the tissue of the small bowel and the large bowel, respectively, through the process of inflammation. As the body’s response to injury, inflammation is characterized by blood-carrying, infection-fighting white blood cells that rush to the site of the injury. Their presence accounts for the painful swelling, warmth and redness associated with an inflammatory reaction.\t Among children, Crohn’s is two times more prevalent than ulcerative colitis. Whereas ulcerative colitis affects only the inner lining of the intestine and is confined to one section, “Crohn’s disease can penetrate the full thickness of the bowel and tends to occur in more than one area,” explains Dr. Alan Lake, a pediatrician and pediatric gastroenterologist at Baltimore’s Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In colitis, however,  ulcers  form where inflammation has destroyed the tissue. The open sores ooze blood, mucus and pus.\t The cause of inflammatory bowel disease has yet to be discovered, although theories abound. Heredity is a factor: 15 to 30 percent of IBD sufferers have a relative with either disorder.\t Symptoms that Suggest Irritable Bowel Syndrome may include:\t   Cramplike pain and spasms in the lower abdomen\t Nausea\t Bloating and gas\t Headache\t Rectal pain\t Backache\t Appetite loss\t Alternating bouts of diarrhea and constipation\t Fatigue\t Depression\t Anxiety\t Difficulty concentrating\t Symptoms that Suggest Inflammatory Bowel Disease may include:\t Crohn’s Disease\t   Cramping abdominal pain and tenderness, particularly after meals\t Nausea\t Diarrhea\t General ill feeling\t Fever\t Appetite loss possibly leading to weight loss\t Bloody stool\t Swelling, pain, stiffness in the knees and ankles\t Cankerlike sores in the mouth\t Eye inflammation\t Irritation or swelling around the rectum\t Fatigue\t Depression\t Anxiety\t Difficulty concentrating\t Delayed growth and sexual development in younger teens, due to lack of nutrition\t Ulcerative Colitis\t   Pain and cramping in the left side of the abdomen\t Intermittent episodes of bloody, mucus-like stool\t Swelling, pain, stiffness in the knees and ankles\t Canker-like sores in the mouth\t Fatigue\t Depression\t Anxiety\t Difficulty concentrating\t Growth retardation in younger teens, due to lack of nutrition\t Acute attacks may include:\t   Up to twenty bloody, loose bowel movements a day\t Urgent need to move bowels\t Severe cramps and rectal pain\t Profuse sweating\t Dehydration\t Nausea\t Appetite loss\t Weight loss\t Abdominal bloating\t Fever up to 104 degrees F\t You can see that many of the symptoms overlap, making diagnosis complicated at times. In general, says Dr. Lake, “the patient with ulcerative colitis has more bloody bowel movements, and the patient with Crohn’s disease experiences more pain.” He goes on to say that while ulcerative colitis is usually picked up quickly, “with Crohn’s disease, many months can pass between the onset of symptoms and the time of diagnosis. Not only are the symptoms subtle, but they can be minimized by cutting back on eating. So it can be difficult for parents to recognize that something is the matter.\t “Frequently, kids are diagnosed because they develop inflammation elsewhere, like the eyes, the mouth and the rectum. If your child has irritation or swelling around the rectum,” he advises, “never assume that it is hemorrhoids, which is all but unheard of in children. The concern should be that he or she has Crohn’s disease.”\t How Irritable Bowel Syndrome is Diagnosed:\t Physical examination and thorough medical history, plus one or more of the following procedures:\t   Urinalysis\t Urine culture\t Complete blood count\t Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (sed rate) blood test\t Stool blood test\t Sigmoidoscopy\t How Inflammatory Bowel Disease is Diagnosed:\t Physical examination and thorough medical history, plus one or more of the following procedures:\t   Complete blood count\t Prothrombin time blood test\t Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (sed rate) blood test\t Stool blood test\t Urinalysis\t Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy\t Upper gastrointestinal (GI) series (also known as a barium swallow)\t Still other laboratory tests may be ordered.\t How Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are Treated\t All of these chronic conditions are incurable but treatable, meaning that steps can be taken on several fronts to reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms.\t   Changes in diet:  Boys and girls with IBS or IBD are able to eat relatively normally when the disease is in remission, which is much of the time. During flareups, though, they need to be conscientious about avoiding certain foods. Your pediatrician will work with a nutritionist or a GI specialist to tailor an eating plan for your youngster. In irritable bowel syndrome, adding roughage to the diet may be all that’s necessary to ease cramping and soften hardened stool or eliminate diarrhea. However, high-fiber foods induce the opposite effect in a teen with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, who should stick to easy-to-digest low-residue items like broth, gelatin, skinless poultry, fish, rice, eggs and pasta. Fried foods and dairy are also taboo when the disease is active. Memo to Mom and Dad: Help spare your son or daughter some of the unwelcome consequences of IBD by serving five or six small meals a day instead of the customary big three.\t Drug therapy:  If diet alone doesn’t bring relief from an irritable bowel, occasionally a pediatrician will prescribe an  antispasmodic  agent to slow down its activity. Medication is usually indicated in Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, where the favored drugs include  corticosteroids  such as prednisone (“the cornerstone of treatment,” according to Dr. Lake), and the  5-ASA  agents sulfasalazine, olsalazine and mesalamine. Should these fail to stem the inflammation, your pediatrician might prescribe one of the following  immunomodulators:  azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate or 6-mercaptopurine. They work by altering the body’s immune response. An IBD patient’s medicine cabinet often contains  antibiotics  and  antidiarrheal  medicines as well.\t Dietary supplements:  From a child's perspective, one of the most upsetting effects of inflammatory bowel disease is its suppression of growth and sexual maturity. Large doses of prednisone can decelerate physical development; accordingly, pediatricians lower the dose or gradually take young people off the drug once it has controlled the inflammation. The main cause of poor growth, however, is insufficient nutrition. Adolescents with IBD sometimes fall into the habit of skimping on breakfast and lunch in order to avoid repeated trips to the bathroom while at school. As a result, they may be lacking in calories, nutrients, vitamins and minerals. Protein is especially crucial for growth. Your pediatrician will monitor your child’s eating patterns. Most nutritional deficiencies can be corrected by tinkering with the diet. If necessary, though, she can prescribe oral supplements and/or high-calorie liquid formulas.\t Surgery:  Cases of inflammatory bowel disease that resist drug therapy or develop complications may require an operation to remove part or all of the colon. This route is rarely taken during the teen years.\t Mental health care:  Emotional stress does not cause IBS or IBD, but it can aggravate either condition. Therefore, patients may benefit a great deal from seeing a mental health professional who can teach them stress-reduction techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation and progressive guided imagery. As with other chronic ailments, inflammatory bowel disease can be frustrating for teenagers. Flareups often leave them more dependent on their parents than they want to be and make them feel different from their friends. They may feel as though their body has betrayed them. If you suspect that your son or daughter is having a hard time coping, ask your pediatrician for a referral to a suitable counselor.",

        "content": "Sometimes children who eat a balanced diet suffer from malnutrition. The reason for this may be malabsorption, the body’s inability to absorb nutrients from the digestive system into the bloodstream.\t Normally the digestive process converts nutrients from the diet into small units that pass through the wall of the intestine and into the bloodstream, where they are carried to other cells in the body. If the intestinal wall is damaged by a virus, bacterial infection, or parasites, its surface may change so that digested substances cannot pass through. When this happens, the nutrients will be eliminated through the stool.\t Malabsorption commonly occurs in a normal child for a day or two during severe cases of stomach or intestinal flu. It rarely lasts much longer since the surface of the intestine heals quickly without significant damage. In these cases, malabsorption is no cause for concern. However, chronic malabsorption may develop, and if two or more of the following signs or symptoms persist, notify your pediatrician.\t Signs and Symptoms\t Possible signs and symptoms of chronic malabsorption include the following:\t   Persistent abdominal pain and vomiting\t Frequent, loose, bulky, foul- smelling stools\t Increased susceptibility to infection\t Weight loss with the loss of fat and muscle\t Increase in bruises\t Bone fractures\t Dry, scaly skin rashes\t Personality changes\t Slowing of growth and weight gain (may not be noticeable for several months)\t Treatment\t When a child suffers from malnutrition, malabsorption is just one of the possible causes. She might be undernourished because she’s not getting enough of the right types of food, or she has digestive problems that prevent her body from digesting them. She also might have a combination of these problems. Before prescribing a treatment, the pediatrician must determine the cause. This can be done in one or more of the following ways.\t   You may be  asked to list the amount and type of food your child eats.\t The pediatrician may  test the child’s ability to digest and absorb specific nutrients. For example, the doctor might have her drink a solution of milk sugar (lactose) and then measure the level of hydrogen in her breath afterward. This is known as a lactose hydrogen breath test.\t The pediatrician may  collect and analyze stool samples. In healthy people, only a small amount of the fat consumed each day is lost through the stool. If too much is found in the stool, it is an indication of malabsorption.\t Collection of sweat  from the skin, called a sweat test, may be performed to see if cystic fibrosis is present. In this disease, the body produces insufficient amounts of certain enzymes necessary for proper digestion and an abnormality in the sweat.\t In some cases  the pediatrician might request that a pediatric gastroenterologist obtain a biopsy from the wall of the small intestine, and have it examined under the microscope for signs of infection, inflammation, or other injury.\t Ordinarily, these tests are performed before any treatment is begun, although a seriously sick child might be hospitalized in order to receive special feedings while her problem is being evaluated.\t Once the physician is sure the problem is malabsorption, she will try to identify a specific reason for its presence. When the reason is infection, the treatment usually will include antibiotics. If malabsorption occurs because the intestine is too active, certain medications may be used to counteract this, so that there’s time for the nutrients to be absorbed.\t Sometimes there’s no clear cause for the problem. In this case, the diet may be changed to include foods or special nutritional formulas that are more easily tolerated and absorbed.",

        "content": "​​Certain diet textures are often prescribed to help infants and children with special needs eat more safely and easily. Children with dysphagia or  gastroesophageal reflux , for example, may need their food to be thicker in order to swallow safely or reduce reflux. In response to concerns over  arsenic in rice , the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) now recommends parents of children with these conditions  use oatmeal  instead of rice cereal.    Why Oatmeal? Children with these conditions were exposed to more rice cereal (and, therefore, more arsenic) for a longer period of time. For infants, this increased exposure also comes at a time when they are developing most rapidly and may be at the greatest risk for side effects of arsenic. Therefore, a safer alternative was needed. Oatmeal is not a member of the wheat family (i.e. oatmeal is gluten-free), so it's also safe for kids with  celiac disease . Tips for Parents:  Talk with your child's pediatrician or feeding specialist about the different types of oatmeal cereals on the market and how to arrive at a just-right consistency. The amount of oatmeal to add to the liquid (formula, breast milk, etc.) is dependent on your child's condition. It is important to follow the recommendations of your pediatrician or feeding therapist. If you are mixing oatmeal cereal in pumped breast milk:  It is best to do it right before your infant will feed. If you mix it too early, the enzymes in the breast milk will break down the oatmeal—making it ineffective. If you are mixing oatmeal cereal in formula:  It is most effective if done no more than 20 to 30 minutes before your infant will feed.  If your child is drinking it from a bottle, you may need to go up to a larger nipple size in order for the oatmeal to flow. Most feeding specialists now recommend either a faster flow nipple or commercially precut, cross-cut nipples provided by the hospital. Be certain that your child is sitting in an appropriate position, as it can affect his or her ease and enjoyment with the meal.  Make sure you are not over feeding your child. If he or she is gaining weight rapidly, but spitting up a lot, try decreasing the amount at each feeding. Infants with reflux, for example, tend to do better with smaller, more frequent meals.  The commercial thickening agent,  Simply Thick , should not be used in any infant. It increases the risk of developing a life-threatening condition called necrotizing enterocolitis.

        "content": "By: Kimera A. Joseph, MD, FAAP & Patrick T. Reeves, MD, FAAP The pancreas has several important jobs in the body. It helps control blood sugar levels, break down food, and empty the stomach during digestion. This vital organ can become inflamed, a condition called pancreatitis. About    15 to 35%  of children have more than one case of pancreatitis but remain in normal health between episodes.  Are there different types of pancreatitis? There are three different types of pancreatitis that can affect children:\t Acute pancreatitis  can be sudden, and inflammation is typically reversible. It is a one-time occurrence and lasts a few days. This is the most common type of pancreatitis found in children.\t Acute recurrent pancreatitis  happens several times during your child's lifetime. It occurs when your child recovers from the initial episode of pancreatitis and has one or more additional episodes.\t Chronic pancreatitis  is constant inflammation of the pancreas that   can last months or even years. What are the signs & symptoms of pancreatitis in children?\t Symptoms of acute and acute recurrent pancreatitis may include:\t Upper abdominal pain Irritability in young children and toddlers Vomiting and nausea Poor appetite Back pain, fever and yellowing of the eyes/skin (jaundice), although these symptoms are rare\t Common symptoms of chronic pancreatitis include: Weight loss Deficiency of certain vitamins \t Fatty stools   Difficulty digesting certain foods (due to cell damage from inflammation) What causes pancreatitis in children? \t The most common causes of acute pancreatitis in children include:   Trauma/injury to the abdomen Systemic illnesses (illnesses affecting other areas of the body)\t Gallstones  or other blockages in the system  Certain drugs/medications  Infection (viruses are the most common) Elevated triglycerides (a type of fat found in blood) and other metabolic issues  Idiopathic (unclear) causes, the leading cause of pancreatitis in children\t Common causes of chronic pancreatitis: Genetic causes such as    cystic fibrosis  among others (most common cause in kids) Gallstones or other blockages in the system caused by abnormal anatomy/structures Metabolic  abnormalities Autoimmune  problems  Idiopathic causes  How is pancreatitis diagnosed?\t Blood tests  look for infection and inflammation. They also check the function of the pancreas and nearby organs. \t Imaging  through ultrasounds and CT scans can look for evidence of pancreatitis. A specific MRI called magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) can also be used but requires anesthesia in young children.\t Stool tests, sweat tests  and    genetic testing  can be used for children with chronic pancreatitis. How is pancreatitis treated in children? Treatment of acute pancreatitis can depend on the cause and severity of your child's illness. Some mild pancreatitis cases may be treated at home using    over-the-counter medicine . Severe cases of pancreatitis may require being admitted to the hospital, where your child could be prescribed stronger medicine to manage pain. Your child may also receive fluids through an IV if they have been vomiting. If your child's pancreatitis is being caused by a gallstone or blockage, then surgery may be required. A procedure called Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is used to remove stones or fix blockages. Will my child have any long-term problems after pancreatitis? Most cases of acute pancreatitis get better in about a week. In rare cases, fluid may collect around the pancreas from inflammation. This condition will eventually go away, but it may need antibiotics or surgery to manage symptoms. With chronic pancreatitis, there can be permanent damage to special cells in the pancreas. Your child may need to stay on a specific diet and take medications to help with digestion. Their treatment plan will be determined by their doctor. Remember Talk with your child's doctor if you have any questions or if your child has symptoms of pancreatitis.

        "content": "By: Ifunanya Agbim, MD, FAAP & Christine Waasdorp Hurtado, MD, FAAP A peptic ulcer is an open sore in the lining of the digestive tract, usually the stomach or upper intestine. Ulcers mostly affect adults, but children and teens can get them, too.  Here's what parents need to know about causes and symptoms of ulcers in kids, and how they're treated. How do ulcers form? Peptic ulcers can form when there is too much of an enzyme called pepsin. Pepsin plays a big role in digestion, breaking down protein in our food. But when the body produces too much pepsin, it can damage the mucosa (inner lining) of the digestive tract. That leads to an ulcer. Types of ulcers Ulcers are named for where they form. When an ulcer develops in the stomach, it's called a gastric ulcer. Ulcers can also form in the first part of the small intestine. These are called duodenal ulcers. What causes ulcers?  In the past, diet and stress were thought to be the most common cause of ulcers. However, we now know there are numerous causes of peptic ulcers, including: H. pylori One of the leading causes of peptic ulcers is a type of bacteria called      Helicobacter pylori  ( H.  P ylori ). It can enter the body through food and water and then live in the digestive tract. Many people with      H. Pylori  remain healthy and never develop symptoms of peptic ulcers. However, others who carry the bacteria develop significant pain and discomfort and require treatment.  NSAIDs Certain types of medications for pain and swelling, such as ibuprofen and naproxen sodium (also known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for NSAIDs), are another common cause of peptic ulcer disease. That's because NSAIDs block certain enzymes that help shield the lining of the digestive tract. This makes the lining more prone to irritation and damage from stomach acid. Other causes Some viruses ( Epstein-Barr  virus), inflammatory bowel disease (particularly Crohn's disease) and cancer      treatments  (radiation and chemotherapy) are also linked with peptic ulcers. What are the signs and symptoms of peptic ulcers? Sharp, burning or gnawing pain in the upper abdomen which comes and goes, but is often present after eating or at night Loss of appetite  Weight loss  Nausea and vomiting Dark colored stool Bloating Belching Anemia Vomit or stool with blood in it How are ulcers diagnosed? One or more of the following are often performed to diagnose peptic ulcer disease: Physical exam and a thorough medical history Blood tests to look for anemia by checking blood cell count and iron levels Stool test to check for blood and/or for            H. pylori Breath tests to check for urea, a substance produced when protein breaks down in the body.\t Esophagogastroduodenoscopy  ( EGD), an exam of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract using a hollow tube equipped with a type of camera called an endoscope. During the procedure, a small sample of tissue is taken for a biopsy to detect         H. pylori . EGD is the most accurate diagnostic test. It can also help to look for active bleeding and guide treatment. How are peptic ulcers treated children and teens? Several types of drugs may be used in treatment: H2 blockers (cimetidine, famotidine), which reduce acid production in the digestive tract Antibiotics,   if diagnostic tests reveal the presence of            H. pylori.  This may be given in combination with bismuth salicylate, a medication for diarrhea, heartburn, nausea and upset stomach. Proton pump inhibitors   (pantoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole), which decrease the amount of stomach acid produced Mucosal protective agents (sucralfate) to protect the lining of the digestive tract from gastric acid Nonprescription antacids taken as needed to neutralize excess stomach acid and relieve abdominal pain How long does it take a stomach ulcer to heal? It could take about 6–8 weeks after treatment for ulcer symptoms to resolve. Your child can start eating a normal diet slowly during this time as they are feeling better. Peptic ulcers occasionally come back after healing. When this happens, repeat treatment with medications for a prolonged period of time (6 months to several years) may be recommended.

        "content": "Fortunately, the most common type of worm infesting children, the pinworm, is essentially harmless. The pinworm is unpleasant to look at and may cause itching and, in girls, vaginal discharge, but it is not responsible for more serious health concerns. Pinworms cause more social concern than medical problems.\t Pinworms are spread easily from one child to another by the transfer of eggs. Often an infected child scratches himself, picking up an egg, and then transfers it to the sandbox or a toilet seat where another child unknowingly picks up the egg and later transfers it to his mouth. The eggs are swallowed, later hatch, and the pinworm makes its way to the anus to again deposit its eggs. Pinworms usually present with itching around your child’s behind at night. Girls may also have vaginal itching. If you take a look at the skin around the anus you may see the adult worms which are whitish gray and threadlike, measuring about  1 ⁄ 4  to  1 ⁄ 2  inch (0.63–1.27 cm) long. Your pediatrician might collect some of the worms and eggs by applying the sticky side of a strip of clear cellophane tape to the skin around the anus. The tape can be examined under a microscope to confirm the presence of the parasite.\t Treatment\t Pinworms can be treated easily with an oral prescription drug, taken in a single dose and then repeated in one to two weeks. This medication causes the mature pinworms to be expelled through bowel movements. Some pediatricians may advise treating the other family members, as well, since one of them may be a carrier without having any symptoms. This medication is not recommended for use in children under two years of age. Also, when the infection is resolved, the child’s underclothes, bedclothes, and sheets should be washed carefully to reduce the risk of reinfection.\t Prevention\t It is very difficult to prevent pinworms, but here are some hints that might be helpful.\t   Encourage your child to wash her hands after using the bathroom.\t Encourage her sitter or child care provider to wash the toys frequently, particularly if pinworms have been detected in one or more of the children.\t Encourage your child to wash her hands after playing with a house cat or dog, since these pets can carry the eggs in their fur.",

        "content": "Yersinia enterocolitica  and  Yersinia pseudotuberculosis  are bacterial infections that are uncommon, but can cause problems when they occur.  Y enterocolitica  causes a condition called enterocolitis, which is an inflammation of the small intestine and colon that occurs, and often recurs, mostly in young children.\t These infections appear to be acquired by eating contaminated food, particularly raw or inadequately cooked pork products, and drinking unpasteurized milk. They might also be contracted by touching an infected animal, drinking contaminated well water, or on rare occasions, from contaminated transfusions. The infections are increasing in frequency among children whose immune system is weakened. The incubation period is around 4 to 6 days.\t Signs and Symptoms\t When a  Y enterocolitica  infection is present, it not only causes an inflamed small intestine and colon, but also symptoms such as diarrhea and a fever. A child with this infection may have stools that contain blood and mucus. These symptoms may last for 1 to 3 weeks, sometimes longer.\t Along with these more common symptoms, very young children who have too much iron stored in their bodies, such as those who receive blood transfusions, or whose immune system is already suppressed or weakened because of another illness, may be susceptible to bacteremia (the spread of bacteria to the blood). Older youngsters may also have symptoms that mimic appendicitis (a pseudoappendicitis syndrome), with right-sided abdominal pain and tenderness. On rare occasions, this infection may be associated with conditions such as a sore throat, eye inflammation, meningitis, and pneumonia. In older youngsters, joint pain or a red skin lump (erythema nodosum) on the lower legs may develop after the infection itself has gone away.\t Children with  Y pseudotuberculosis  will likely develop a fever, a rash, and abdominal pain, including the pseudoappendicitis syndrome. Some children may also have diarrhea, a rash, and excess fluid in the chest region or spaces around the joints.\t When to Call Your Pediatrician\t Contact your pediatrician if your child’s stool is streaked with blood. Look for signs of dehydration that could be caused by your youngster’s diarrhea, including dry mouth, unusual thirst, and a decline in the frequency of urination.\t How Is the Diagnosis Made?\t Your pediatrician can order tests to detect the presence of  Yersinia  organisms in your child’s stool. Evidence of the infection may also be seen by taking throat swabs and evaluating them in the laboratory, examining the urine, or testing the blood for antibodies to the bacteria.\t Because these are relatively rare infections, most laboratories do not routinely perform tests looking for  Yersinia  organisms in feces.\t Treatment\t In most children, the infection will go away on its own. In some cases,  Yersinia  infections need to be treated with antibiotics.

        "content": "By: Rian C. Calo, DO, FAAP & Patrick T. Reeves, MD, FAAP Children can sometimes have different colored stools (poops). The most common, normal    color  of stool is brown, tan, yellow or green.  Red poops can be caused by many different things, including a variety of foods, medicine or other factors. Less commonly, children can have red or dark-colored poop that is caused by bleeding or diseases of the digestive tract or gut.  But it is important to note: the most common reasons for children to have red poops are    not   because of blood. Causes of red stools that are    not  blood Foods Even when it's caused by something they ate or drank, seeing red- or purple-tinged poop in your child's diaper or toilet can be unsettling since it can look like blood. The passage of poop through the gut can be very fast in infants or young children. So, their poop can come out the same color of the food or fluid that they have eaten (such as bright red after watermelon). Food coloring  that is added to many drinks, breakfast cereals, gelatin desserts—or from the coloring of different foods like tomato skins, beets, red peppers, rhubarb, paprika or peach skins—can all cause poop to take on a red color. In addition, foods like spinach, licorice, chocolate sandwich cookies such as Oreos, dark chocolate, dark purple grapes, dark juices, blueberries or cranberries can also cause black poop. Medicine Many medications can cause poop to be red or dark-reddish or black in color.  Bismuth.  Common  over-the-counter  medications with brand names including Pepto-Bismol, Maalox and Kaopectate contain a medicine called bismuth. Bismuth can color the stools black or dark red.  Iron  supplements or medications that contain bright red dyes  (such as cherry syrup flavored antibiotics or laxatives) can cause dark or red tints to the poop. Certain  antibiotics  such as rifampin can cause orange/red discoloration of both urine and the stools in children.  Many other medications  can cause orange/red or pink/red colorations of stools, too, including phenothiazines, rifabutin, senna or tetracyclines.  If you notice a change in the color of your child's poops, review this list and ask your child's doctor about it. When there    is  blood in the stool  Swallowed blood during birth or breastfeeding Sometimes there    is  blood in the poop, but not from bleeding in the child's digestive tract. Babies can develop red poops after swallowing the birth parent's blood during delivery, for example, or blood from a cracked, bleeding nipple during  breastfeeding . Swallowed blood from nosebleeds or other sources Swallowed blood can also be from recent procedures, such as if your child had a  tonsillectomy , or even from a recent  nosebleed . Sometimes  bleeding in the urine  can also be confused with blood in the stool, especially in young girls. Female infants can also pass blood into their diaper from the vagina due to a \"mini-period\" ( false menses ) that can occur after delivery. This is common and nothing to be alarmed about. It simply suggests the child has a healthy uterus. \t Try the  towel test:  If you notice blood in the diaper and it is mixed in poop and urine, you can place the child on a towel without a diaper for several hours. This can help better determine if the blood is mixed in poop or urine. Blood from diaper rash or anal fissures Oftentimes, infants can have blood in their diaper around the anus because of  diaper rash . In older children, especially during  toilet training , children can have small skin tears around the anus from  constipation  called anal fissures.  For either diaper rash or anal fissures, use a zinc oxide topical treatment with every diaper change to help prevent further irritation to the skin. Blood from infection or bleeding in the gut Rarely, the red or dark poop is caused by an infectious disease or bleeding from the digestive tract.  Infections from travel, food or other people can sometimes cause bleeding. Food allergies, autoimmune diseases, or other problems of the digestive tract can also lead to blood in the stool. If you are concerned that your child has blood in the poop, don't hesitate to talk with your child's primary care physician.   What you can do at home Stop foods or drinks that you think could be causing the red or dark poops. This should clear up the red and/or dark color from the poops in about 48 hours.  Take a picture of unusual stools so that if they continue you can show your doctor. Try to confirm that the red substance (blood) is coming from the poop by using the towel method described above. If these red poops continue for more than 2 weeks, then please seek medical attention from your child's primary care provider.   When to see your doctor If your child is having red stools and a  fever , bring them to see your doctor or go to the emergency room if they are acting sick or becoming worse. You should also see your doctor if you see that the red poops are continuing, even after stopping the suspected foods for more than 48 hours. Tests & procedures to check for blood in stools There are different tests that your doctor can order to determine if it is really blood in the poop. A    stool guaiac test  is a simple test that your doctor can order determine whether the red substance in the poop is blood. A sample of the poop can also be sent off to test for things like infection or inflammation. Your child's doctor may consider other options to help determine the cause of red poops. These may include imaging with radiology, blood tests or a specialty referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist. Sometimes a special procedure called a colonoscopy or endoscopy can be performed by a pediatric gastroenterologist. These allow the doctor to look directly into your child's digestive tract and help identify causes of blood in the stool.

        "content": "“I  just don’t know what to do,” my friend Elizabeth said one morning over coffee. “Jake’s eating problems seem to be getting worse, and I think he’s developing some kind of breathing problem.” Jake, her 18-month-old son, had always been a fussy eater. He frequently didn’t have an appetite, often vomited when he did eat, and weighed less than other toddlers his age. “He’s my first baby, and I don’t know if he is just a picky eater,” Elizabeth said in frustration, “or if there’s something wrong.”\t Common or Serious?\t The following week, Elizabeth took Jake to see a pediatrician who specializes in digestive and intestinal conditions, called a pediatric gastroenterologist. The doctor explained that just because a baby spits up doesn’t necessarily mean he suffers from GERD — the abbreviation for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is common in infants, and most babies outgrow it by the age of 1. Some children continue to suffer from it even as they age, however. “GER occurs during or after a meal when stomach contents go back into the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach,” notes Leo A. Heitlinger, M.D., FAAP, Chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Gastroenterology and Nutrition.\t “GER occurs often in normal infants. Most infants with GER are happy and healthy even though they spit up or vomit. Spitting up tends to peak at four months and most infants stop spitting up by 12 months of age. If your baby is spitting up without discomfort and is making appropriate weight gains, then he or she is probably a normal spitter.” Elizabeth’s pediatric gastroenterologist gave her a checklist from the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the Children’s Digestive  Health and Nutrition Foundation, which recommended the following:\t   Avoid overfeeding. Don’t feed the baby again after he or she spits up — wait until the next feeding.\t Consult your doctor to see if the baby is taking appropriately sized bottles or nursing the appropriate amount of time.\t For formula-fed infants, your pediatrician may recommend a special anti-reflux formula or that feedings be thickened with a small amount of infant rice cereal.\t For formula-fed infants, your pediatrician may advise you to try a formula created to be non-allergenic (hypoallergenic) for two weeks.\t Keep your infant upright for at least 30 minutes after meals.\t Only put your baby in a car seat when driving in the car.\t Avoid tight diapers and elastic waistbands.\t Avoid exposure to tobacco smoke.\t Treating GERD\t Within a few weeks, Elizabeth and her pediatrician knew that Jake’s problems were more severe. Jake was diagnosed with GERD, with classic symptoms: vomiting, poor weight gain, heartburn, excessive crying, and respiratory problems. The doctor explained that GERD occurs when the muscle at the end of a baby’s esophagus doesn’t function properly and doesn’t prevent the contents of the baby’s stomach from backing up in to the esophagus. This causes a burning sensation in a baby’s chest and/or throat.\t If your child is diagnosed with GERD, your doctor may recommend a few simple but important strategies, according to Donald Schiff, M.D., FAAP, and Steven P. Shelov, M.D., M.S., FAAP, editors of “Guide to Your Child’s Symptoms.”\t   Time the evening meal so your child has an hour or two of quiet relaxation but nothing more to eat or drink before bedtime.\t For older children: After mealtime, have your child sit upright in a chair, reading, doing homework, or some other calm activity to give the digestive process time to work.\t Lying down soon after eating encourages the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus. Your child may sleep more comfortably if you raise the head of her bed. Sleeping with the upper part of the body elevated uses gravity to discourage reflux.\t If your child is troubled by indigestion or other symptoms related to GERD, your pediatrician may also prescribe a medication to help her stomach contents move through the digestive tract more easily.\t This article was featured in Healthy Children Magazine.

It can affect all organs of the body, but most often injures the brain and the liver.\t Reye syndrome is preceded by a viral infection, most commonly chickenpox or influenza. Although no one knows precisely what causes Reye syndrome, it affects only a small number of children, and is strongly associated with aspirin or aspirin-containing medication during the viral infection.\t Signs and Symptoms\t Whenever your child has a viral illness, be alert for the following pattern typical of Reye syndrome: Your child may develop a viral infection, such as influenza, an upper respiratory illness, or chickenpox, and then seem to be improving. However, then he abruptly starts to vomit repeatedly and frequently every one or two hours over a twenty-four to thirty-six-hour period, becoming lethargic or sleepy, which then turns into agitation, delirium, or anger. Then he may become confused or even become unresponsive.

It is very important to diagnose this illness as early as possible.\t Prevention\t Since the medical community issued a public warning against the use of aspirin during viral illnesses, the number of cases of Reye syndrome has decreased greatly. Therefore,  we strongly recommend that you do not give aspirin or any medications containing aspirin to your child or teenager when he has any viral illness, particularly chickenpox or influenza.  If he needs medication for mild fever or discomfort, give him acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is approved for use in children six months of age or older; however, it should never be given to children who are dehydrated or who are vomiting continuously.",

        "content": "By: Campbell Grant, MD & Christopher Jaeger, MD A hydrocele describes fluid that collects and causes swelling of the scrotum around the testicle. Many newborn boys have this problem, though it usually goes away by around their  first birthday  without any treatment. Babies born    prematurely  are at an increased risk of having a hydrocele.  Although babies born female don't have testicles, they have a similar supporting structure in the groin called the  inguinal canal ; in rare cases, can also get hydroceles.  How do I know if my child has a hydrocele? Hydroceles can occur at any age, but are most common in newborns and infants. Hydroceles usually present as a bulge in the scrotum. The hydrocele may change size throughout the day, getting worse with crying or straining and then get better at night when your child is lying down. The size of the hydrocele may also change over weeks, getting smaller or larger.  Hydroceles are usually not painful. If your child is having lots of sudden pain in the scrotum or groin and scrotal swelling, it is possible that the testicle has twisted on itself (called  testicular torsion ) or a piece of intestine is stuck in the groin. If you think your child may have either of these problems, you should call your pediatrician immediately or take them to the nearest emergency room.  What causes a hydrocele to form? There are two main reasons why hydroceles form. This first way happens in the womb as a baby's testicles start growing within their abdomen. As the baby develops, the testicles travel down into the scrotum. Occasionally, this tunnel (called the processus vaginalis) does not close, leaving an opening between the scrotum and the belly. This is called a \"communicating hydrocele.\" The second way happens when fluid becomes trapped within the scrotum after the tunnel closes. This is called a \"non-communicating hydrocele\" and can also be caused by surgery, trauma or inflammation.  What is the difference between communicating and non-communicating hydrocele? The two types of hydroceles, \"communicating\" and \"non-communicating,\" refer to whether or not the hydrocele connects to the belly. In communicating hydroceles, there is an opening between the scrotum and the belly that allows fluid to freely pass between the two areas. In a \"non-communicating\" hydrocele the tunnel between the two has been closed, but the fluid is unable to be removed by the scrotum.  What is the difference between a hydrocele and an inguinal hernia? Hydroceles are very similar to  inguinal hernias , which happen when part of the intestines push through the inguinal canal.  In a communicating hydrocele, the tunnel can be small so that only fluid passes between the abdomen and the scrotum. Inguinal hernias often have larger openings between the belly and the scrotum. Because of the larger opening, things such as bowel or other tissue can slip through. If the bowel or tissue gets stuck, this can become an emergency. Inguinal hernias often require surgery sooner than hydroceles.  Will any tests need to be done to see if my child has a hydrocele? Most of the time, a doctor can diagnose a hydrocele by what they see when they examine your child. Hydroceles will usually \"transilluminate.\" This means that you can shine light through them and see the light from the other side.  Sometimes a doctor will order an ultrasound to look for a testicle in the hydrocele or to distinguish between a hydrocele and an inguinal hernia or mass. How is a hydrocele treated? Many hydroceles will resolve on their own. If they have not gone away by one year of age, then your child may need surgery. Your doctor will refer you to a pediatric urologist or pediatric surgeon for the procedure.  What type of surgery is done for a hydrocele? To treat a hydrocele, a small incision is made in the groin. The surgeon will check to be sure there is no connection between the hydrocele and the abdomen that needs to be closed. The hydrocele sac will be opened to drain all of the fluid, and then the sac will be removed. The surgery generally takes between 30 minutes to an hour. What should I expect on the day of hydrocele surgery? Before surgery you will meet with an anesthesiologist. Surgery to repair a hydrocele is typically done under general anesthetic, although regional anesthesia can be used. Your child will be asleep during the procedure. Once your child wakes up from surgery someone from the recovery room will call you and you will be able to be with your child. Your child may have some pain where the incision was made or down in the scrotum. Some surgeons will inject medicine near the incision to help control pain. Your child may need to take pain medicine when they are home. Most children will not need narcotics for this procedure.  When can my child go home after hydrocele surgery? Typically, hydrocele surgery is an outpatient or \"same day\" surgery---meaning your child can go home after a few hours of recovery. However, if your child has certain medical conditions they may be required to stay overnight for observation. When should I call the doctor's office? You will receive specific instructions for follow-up with your surgeon when your child goes home after surgery for hydrocele. However, here are some key reasons to call: Bleeding or drainage from the incision Redness around the wound Fever above 101 F Vomiting Less peeing or fewer wet diapers than normal Can a hydrocele come back? In less than 1% of patients, a hydrocele can recur. These may go away on their own, but if they do not, your child may need to see the surgeon again.

        "content": "Shigella  bacteria cause a diarrheal illness that can occur in children. Four species of  Shigella  bacteria  (S boydii, S dysenteriae, S flexneri,  and  S sonnei)  have been identified as infecting the lining of the intestines. These bacterial illnesses are highly contagious. They are spread through the feces of people with the infection, particularly in close contact environments such as within families and in child care centers. They can also be contracted by consuming contaminated food or water or by touching an object on which the bacteria may be present. Children aged 2 to 4 years are particularly vulnerable to developing the disease. The incubation period is usually 2 to 4 days.\t Signs and Symptoms\t A  Shigella  infection can cause mild watery or loose stools with no other symptoms, or it can be more serious, with fever, abdominal cramps or tenderness, crampy rectal pain (tenesmus), and mucous-filled and sometimes bloody stools.\t When to Call Your Pediatrician\t Call your pediatrician if you notice blood in your child’s stool, there’s no improvement in her diarrhea, or she is showing signs of dehydration.\t How Is the Diagnosis Made?\t A pediatrician may order laboratory tests in which a culture of the child’s feces is examined for evidence of  Shigella  bacteria.\t Treatment\t If your child’s symptoms are mild, your pediatrician may decide that it’s not necessary to prescribe medicine to treat the infection. These children generally get better rapidly without any medicine. However, antibiotics such as cefixime, ampicillin, or trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole may be prescribed in more severe cases. These drugs can kill  Shigella  bacteria in the child’s stools, shorten the duration of the diarrhea, and lower the chances of spreading the illness.\t If your child is having lots of watery diarrhea, be sure to give her extra fluids to avoid dehydration. It is important that the fluids contain salt because salts are lost in the diarrhea. Rehydration fluids are sold over the counter, but you can also make these at home. Talk to your pediatrician to be sure you have the correct amount of salt and water. In severe cases, intravenous fluids may be required.\t Do not self-prescribe antidiarrheal medicines, which can actually make your child worse.\t What Is the Prognosis?\t In most cases,  Shigella  infections run their course in 2 to 3 days. Occasionally, complications may develop, including bacteremia (bacteria in the blood), hemolytic uremic syndrome (a disorder characterized by kidney failure and anemia), and Reiter syndrome (painful urination, joint achiness).\t Prevention\t If your child attends a child care facility, make sure staff members practice good hygiene, including frequent hand washing, particularly before food preparation and after diaper changes, and regularly disinfect toys. At home as well as at these child care settings, food should be stored, handled, and prepared according to good sanitation guidelines. People with a diarrheal illness should not be involved in preparing food for others.",

        "content": "Stomach bugs tend to be the nastiest illnesses our children bring home from  school . \t 7 Truths & Tips for Survival of Stomach Bugs When They Hit Your Home\t Hand washing and keeping things clean  are your best defenses from getting ill with a stomach bug. Not surprisingly, this is particularly true after touching or supporting your child and when  preparing food and eating . Some viruses will survive on surfaces for days. And some viruses like Norovirus can even survive  hand sanitizer . You have to use soap and water to kill it. But even with ridiculous, meticulous attention to hygiene, every parent knows that when the vomit is flying, it’s hard to lasso every single errant particle. So simply commit to do your best. Change the sheets and clean up areas of vomit immediately after supporting your child. Soapy warm water is your friend. Wash surfaces immediately, use hot water for the wash, and use high heat in the dryer.\t 24 hours (or so):  In general, most pediatricians will tell you that  vomiting  doesn’t exceed 24 hours with typical gastroenteritis. Occasionally it can. Many kids don’t follow the rules. Once a virus that causes gastroenteritis takes hold of a child, vomiting starts. Children tend to vomit more than adults. Part may be an easy gag reflex. With most viruses that cause the “stomach flu,” as the infection moves through the stomach and intestines, vomiting stops after about 24 hours. But not always. If you advance  liquids  too quickly or children eat more solids than they are ready for, even after the first meal 1 to 2 days into eating again, they may have a vomit encore. If you have one of those, start back where you started (sips of clear liquids) and go very slow advancing their diet. If vomiting is accelerating at 24 hours, it is time to check in with your child’s doctor.\t Disgusting and terrifying:  It’s creepy-eepy to take care of a child with vomiting. Not only is it entirely gnarly and disgusting to remove and clean chunks from vomit-laden carpet, sheets, and clothing, it’s also terrifying to provide support to a vomiting child because you can get equally uneasy about catching the virus. You’re not alone in this. It’s absolutely nauseating to see your own child ill, unwell, and retching. And it’s awful to imagine having to provide care while getting miserably sick. Do your best to keep your  hands washed  and keep the love going. As all of us know, when you find yourself picking out vomit bits from the carpet at 3:00 am, it really can only get better from there.\t Medication:  Children rarely need medication when recovering from gastroenteritis. Although some antinausea drugs are available for use in children, most children don’t need prescription medications. Talk with your child’s pediatrician if you feel you child is vomiting longer than 24 hours or becoming  dehydrated . Remember that vomiting is a protection reaction of your child’s body to clear infection.\t Soap, water, and bleach:  William Osler said, “Soap and water and common sense are the best  disinfectants .” Cleaning your home to avoid spreading infection is a must. You don’t need expensive products, just vigilance. With some highly infectious viruses that cause vomiting, even 10 viral particles can cause illness. So in addition to soap and water, consider using a dilute  bleach  solution to clean hard surfaces.\t Detective work:  Sometimes you’ll simply never know where it all came from. But it won’t stop you from playing the role of infectious detective. The only issue: this is simply wasted time.\t Yummy, clingy love:  There is an occasional perk to a terrible stomach bug. And we have to find one to maintain a sense of optimism. When our children are ill, they really turn over and show us they want us over anything else on earth. \t Then there is  resilience . Children do very well recovering from typical viral gastroenteritis, although  diarrhea  can last for days. Even so, our children’s resilience will long astonish us.\t Additional Information: \t Stomachaches in Children & Teens\t Food-Borne Illnesses Prevention \t Treating Vomiting\t Diarrhea\t Drinks to Prevent Dehydration in a Vomiting Child\t Cleaners, Sanitizers & Disinfectants\t Preventing the Spread of Illness in Child Care or School\t Hand Washing: A Powerful Antidote to Illness",

        "content": "By: Bruno P. Chumpitazi, MD, MPH, FAAP & Ann R. McMeans, MS, RD, LDN  What we eat can have a big impact on our overall health. If you have a child with    irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) , you know that certain foods seem to trigger their digestive symptoms. Your pediatrician may have recommended that your child try a low-FODMAP diet. But what are FODMAPs? And what is this diet all about?  Understanding FODMAPs FODMAP stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. These are sugars (carbohydrates) that are found in a wide variety of foods we eat often. FODMAP sugars include: Oligosaccharides: Fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) Disaccharides: Lactose Monosaccharides: Fructose Polyols: Sorbitol and mannitol  FODMAPs can cause digestive problems in some people, especially those with IBS. That's because scientists have found that our small intestines don't absorb or digest FODMAPs very well. This leads to more water entering the gut. Then when FODMAP sugars reach the colon, they create more gas.  All this excess fluid and gas can lead to symptoms such as:  Abdominal Discomfort Abdominal Pain Cramping Flatulence Bloating Diarrhea Constipation  FODMAPs aren't unhealthy or bad. They just have the potential to make symptoms worse in people with sensitive digestive systems, such as those with IBS.  FODMAP content in foods There are many foods that are high in FODMAPs. This table gives a list of some common ones, as well as alternatives that kids can eat while on the diet. However, it's not by any means a complete list. We recommend kids work with a registered dietitian when possible.  FODMAP Type High-FODMAP Foods Low-FODMAP Alternatives Fructose  High fructose corn syrup (used in many foods/beverages), molasses, honey, apples, pears, boysenberry, mango, fruit juices, agave syrup Grapes, strawberries, cantaloupe, oranges, pineapple, banana, blueberries, maple syrup, rice syrup Lactose Cow's milk, yogurt made with cow's milk, heavy cream, half and half; pudding, custard, any product with milk as a main ingredient Most cheeses in moderation (1–2 ounces per day); lactose-free milk and yogurt Sorbitol and mannitol Avocado, apples, nectarines, peaches, sugar-free candy and gums, watermelon, mushrooms, cauliflower, pears, whole corn on the cob Candy and gum made with sucrose or starch; sucrose in foods and beverages Fructans and GOS Garlic, onion, wheat (bread, pasta), beans, cashews, falafel, cooked lentils, pistachios, hummus, coconut milk Peanut butter, canned lentils (limited), some nuts in restricted quantities The low-FODMAP diet This diet is often referred to as simply the    FODMAP diet . But technically, it's a    low-FODMAP diet . That's because it focuses on limiting the intake of high-FODMAP foods. The diet includes three phases and was created in Australia specifically for people with IBS, a common issue in both children and adults. Your pediatrician may recommend a low-FODMAP diet if your child has IBS. Research has shown that this diet has helped many adults and kids with IBS manage their symptoms.  Because the low-FODMAP diet is so restrictive, it's not for people who are otherwise healthy. Your child should only be on this diet if it has been recommended by your doctor. We recommend working with a registered dietitian while your child is on this diet. Your pediatrician can suggest one or you can find one at the    Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics website .  Here's what you can expect in the three phases of this diet.  Phase 1: Elimination In the first phase, your child stops eating foods that are high in FODMAPs for 2–6 weeks. We often recommend 2 weeks because it can be hard to follow such a restrictive diet. You should know by the end of this phase whether the diet is helping your child's symptoms.  Keep in mind that not everyone that tries the low-FODMAP diet has symptom relief. You may need to work with your child's pediatrician on finding other options if the diet doesn't help.  Phase 2: Reintroduction You'll move on to the second phase if your child's symptoms have improved. In this phase, you'll introduce high-FODMAP foods back into your child's diet. We recommend reintroducing one FODMAP at a time—for example, lactose—typically over three days. This allows your child to tell which of the FODMAPs are causing symptoms. If the digestive issues (pain, gas, etc.) start again after a FODMAP type is reintroduced, take it back out of their diet.  You may want to take a break if your child's symptoms get worse with one FODMAP before reintroducing another one. It's also a good idea to keep a food diary during this time to track what your child is eating and how they react.  The goal of this phase is to help you pinpoint which foods your child can tolerate and which ones cause digestive distress. If you need to take breaks in between reintroducing FODMAP types, this phase can take up to a month.  Phase 3: Personalization Once you've figured out which foods cause digestive symptoms, you can personalize the diet to your child's needs. In this phase, you'll have your child limit or completely avoid the FODMAP types that give them problems. Your child can enjoy the others without worrying about their symptoms coming back.  Risks of FODMAP diet The risks of a low-FODMAP diet are not getting enough nutrients or enough calories. For growing kids, this is a concern. That's why it's a good idea to work with a registered dietitian to come up with a healthy diet for your child during the three phases. This will help reduce these nutritional risks.  Interestingly, our initial research suggests that children with IBS often typically eat a poor diet, similar actually to what healthy kids eat. But kids with IBS who work with a registered dietitian to follow a low-FODMAP diet have some initial improvement, even in the first phase, in their overall diet quality.  Your child shouldn't try a low-FODMAP diet if they have an eating disorder or if they're already following a specialized diet.  You can learn more about the low-FODMAP diet, take online courses, and find recipes at the    Monash University site , where the diet was created. They also have    an app  that gives you low-FODMAP food recommendations and lets you look up foods.  Remember Talk with your pediatrician if you have any concerns about your child's digestive health.

        "content": "The most important treatment for young children with vomiting or diarrhea is to keep them adequately hydrated. This means giving them plenty of breast milk, formula, electrolyte solution or other fluids.  Using electrolyte replacement solution at home For severe dehydration,  hospitalization  is sometimes necessary so that your child can be rehydrated with intravenous (IV) fluids. With milder cases of dehydration, all that may be needed is to give your child an electrolyte replacement solution according to your pediatrician's directions.  This table shows the approximate amount of electrolyte solution to be used:\t   Body Weight (lbs) Minimum Daily Fluid Requirements (oz)* Electrolyte Solution Requirements for Mild Diarrhea (oz/24 hrs) 6-7 10 16 11 15 23 22 25 40 26 28 44 33 32 51 40 38 61\t *Note: This is the smallest amount of fluid that a normal child requires. Most children drink more than this.\t Breastfeeding to keep your child hydrated Exclusively  breastfed  babies are less likely to develop severe diarrhea. If a breastfed infant does develop diarrhea, generally you can continue breastfeeding, giving additional electrolyte solution only if your doctor feels this is necessary. Many breastfed babies can continue to stay hydrated with frequent breastfeeding alone. Returning to a normal diet after diarrhea Once diarrhea is decreasing and your child wants to eat, you gradually may expand their diet with a goal of returning to their usual diet as they can tolerate it. Sometimes, drinking milk worsens diarrhea. So, in children over one year of age, your pediatrician may recommend holding off on milk. Or, they may advise giving lactose-free formula or milk for a period of time.  It is not necessary to withhold food for longer than 24 hours. Your child will need some normal nutrition to start to regain lost strength. After you have started giving them food again, their stools may remain loose. However, that does not necessarily mean that things are not going well. Look for increased activity, better appetite, more frequent urination, and the disappearance of any of the signs of dehydration. When you see these, you will know your child is getting better. When sugary drinks cause diarrhea If your child drinks too much fluid, especially too much juice or sweetened beverages as mentioned earlier, a condition commonly referred to as toddler's diarrhea could develop. This causes ongoing loose stools but shouldn't affect appetite or growth or cause dehydration. Although toddler's diarrhea is not a dangerous condition, your pediatrician may suggest that you limit the amounts of juice and sweetened fluids your child drinks. Ideally, toddlers and children should mainly drink plain    water  and milk.  Remember Talk with your child's pediatrician any time you are worried about their health.",

        "content": "What's the best way to treat vomiting? \t In most cases, vomiting will stop without specific medical treatment. The majority of cases are caused by a virus and will get better on their own. You should never use over-the-counter or prescription remedies unless they've been specifically prescribed by your pediatrician for your child and for this particular illness. \t When your infant or young child is vomiting, keep her lying on her stomach or side as much as possible. Doing this will minimize the chances of her inhaling vomit into her upper airway and lungs. \t Watch for Dehydration \t When there is continued vomiting, you need to make certain that dehydration doesn't occur. Dehydration is a term used when the body loses so much water that it can no longer function efficiently. If allowed to reach a severe degree, it can be serious and life-threatening. To prevent this from happening, make sure your child consumes enough extra fluids to restore what has been lost through throwing up. If she vomits these fluids, notify your pediatrician. \t Modify Your Child's Diet \t For the first twenty-four hours or so of any illness that causes vomiting, keep your child off solid foods, and encourage her to suck or drink small amounts of electrolyte solution (ask your pediatrician which one), clear fluids such as water, sugar water (1/2 teaspoon [2.5 ml] sugar in 4 ounces [120 ml] of water), Popsicles, gelatin water (1 teaspoon [5 ml] of flavored gelatin in 4 ounces of water) instead of eating. Liquids not only help to prevent dehydration, but also are less likely than solid foods to stimulate further vomiting. \t Be sure to follow your pediatrician's guidelines for giving your child fluids. Your doctor will adhere to requirements like those descibed below.\t Estimated Oral Fluid and Electrolyte Requirements by Body Weight\t  \t Body Weight (in pounds) \t Minimum Daily Fluid Requirements (in ounces)*\t Electrolyte Solution Requirements for Mild Diarrhea (in ounces for 24 hours)  \t 6 – 7 \t 10 \t 16 \t 11 \t 15 \t 23\t 22 \t 25 \t 40 \t 26 \t 28 \t 44 \t 33 \t 32 \t 51 \t 40 \t 38 \t 61   1 pound = 0.45 kilograms 1 ounce = 30 ml *NOTE: This is the  smallest  amount of fluid that a normal child requires. Most children drink more than this.  \t In most cases, your child will just need to stay at home and receive a liquid diet for twelve to twenty-four hours. Your pediatrician usually won’t prescribe a drug to treat the vomiting, but some doctors will prescribe antinausea medications to children. \t If your child also has diarrhea, ask your pediatrician for instructions on giving liquids and restoring solids to her diet. \t When to Call the Pediatrician\t If she can’t retain any clear liquids or if the symptoms become more severe, notify your pediatrician. She will examine your child and may order blood and urine tests or X-rays to make a diagnosis. Occasionally hospital care may be necessary.\t Until your child feels better, remember to keep her hydrated, and call your pediatrician right away if she shows signs of dehydration. If your child looks sick, the symptoms aren’t improving with time, or your pediatrician suspects a bacterial infection, he may perform a culture of the stool, and treat appropriately.",

        "content": "​​​​​​By: Henry Chang, MD, FAAP The umbilical cord delivers all the nutrients babies needs before birth. Once a baby is born it is cut, the outside part of the cord falls off. The skin on the baby heals up and becomes the umbilicus (belly button). In most cases, the muscle around the umbilicus closes up soon after the baby is born.      What is an umbilical hernia? In about 1 in 5 newborns, the muscle around the belly button doesn’t close. The small opening that remains in the baby’s abdominal wall under the belly button is called an umbilical hernia. Because of this, a portion of intestine can pop out into a hernia sac that is covered only by skin. ​ How do I know if my child has an umbilical hernia? The most common sign of an umbilical hernia is a bulging of the belly button. The bulge will typically come and go. It may be large when your child is straining or crying. When your child relaxes, the bulge may go away. At times, the bulge may stretch the skin as the hernia becomes bigger. Is an umbilical hernia harmful?​ Most of the time, umbilical hernias do not cause any problems. In very rare cases, the organs from inside the belly are trapped (“incarcerated”) inside the hernia sac. This results in the bulge being present even when your child is calm.  It is even more rare for the organs trapped inside the hernia sac to have their blood flow reduced (“strangulated”). If this happens, your child will likely have severe pain. The belly button may be very sensitive to the touch. The belly button bulge may also be red. Your child may have a fever, throw up, or refuse to eat. If this happens, your child needs to be seen right away. Call your doctor’s office or go to the emergency room.​​ Will any tests need to be done to see if my child has an umbilical hernia? Most of the time, your child’s doctor can diagnose an umbilical hernia by examining your child. Rarely, they may order an ultrasound to see if there is a hernia or to see if belly organs are trapped inside the hernia. An ultrasound is a test used to look at organs underneath the skin and will not hurt your child. A jelly-like liquid will be placed on the belly button and a probe will be used on the skin to see the organs underneath. How is an umbilical hernia treated? Most umbilical hernias (about 90%) will close on their own by the time children are 4 years old and nothing needs to be done. The size of the hole in the muscle (and not how far the hernia sticks out) is a better predictor of whether the hernia will close on its own. Since most umbilical hernias do not cause problems, it is safe to wait until your child is closer to 4 years old before thinking about having surgery. Surgery is the only thing that will fix an umbilical hernia if it does not close on its own. Binders and other things done to hold the hernia in do not work and may make the hernia worse or harm the skin.  ​What problems might my child have from an umbilical hernia? After surgery, most children do not have problems. Rarely, a hern​​ia can come back and you may see a bulge in the belly button again. If that happens, you will need to see your child’s surgeon again. More information ​ Umbilical Hernia Surgery (Herniorraphy)​ About Dr. Chang ​ Henry L.

        "content": "Much misinformation has circulated about ADHD and its causes, diagnosis, and treatment over recent decades. Following are a number of untrue assumptions about the disorder, along with explanations aimed at clarifying the issues.        “ My preschooler is too young to have ADHD .” Many parents believe that ADHD is a problem of school-aged children. But, in fact, the symptoms of ADHD, and the  diagnosis of the condition , can occur as early as the preschool years. At times, even doctors have difficulty differentiating “normal” behavior from those suggesting ADHD in a preschooler. Although a young child may normally have characteristics like impulsive or hyperactive behavior, these can be symptoms of ADHD as well. A pediatrician will evaluate the intensity of these behaviors in a preschooler to help in making the diagnosis. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is diagnosed when these problems get to the point where they are significantly and consistently interfering with a preschooler’s life, development, self-esteem and general functioning. “He’s just lazy and unmotivated. ” This assumption is a common response to the behavior exhibited by a child who is struggling with ADHD. A child who finds it nearly impossible to stay focused in class, or to complete a lengthy task such as writing a long essay, may try to save face by acting as though he does not want to do it or is too lazy to finish. This behavior may look like laziness or lack of motivation, but it stems from real difficulty in functioning. All children want to succeed and get praised for their good work. If such tasks were easy for children with ADHD to accomplish, and provided rewarding feedback, those children would seem just as “motivated” as anyone else. “He’s a handful—or, she’s a daydreamer—but that’s normal . They just don’t let kids be kids these days.” It is true that all children are impulsive, active, and inattentive at times, sometimes to the extreme. A child with ADHD, however, is more than just a “handful” for his parents and teachers, or a “daydreamer” who tends to lose herself in thought. His or her  hyperactivity and/or inattentiveness  constitute a real day-to-day functional disability. That is, it seriously and consistently impedes the ability to succeed at school, fit into family routines, follow household rules, maintain friendships, interact positively with family members, avoid injury, or otherwise manage in his or her environment. As you will learn in Chapter 2, this clear functional disability is what pediatricians look for when diagnosing ADHD and recommending treatment. “ Treatment for ADHD will cure it .  The goal is to get off medication as soon as possible .”  Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder  is a chronic condition that often does not entirely go away, but instead changes form over time. Many older adolescents and adults are able to organize their lives and use techniques that allow them to forego medical treatment, although a significant number continue various forms of treatment and support throughout their life spans. Depending on the circumstances and demands as a person matures, this may or may not include continuing with medication or other treatments for ADHD at different times, even through adult life. The true goal is to function well at each stage of childhood and adolescence, and as an adult, rather than to stop any or all treatments as soon as possible. “He focuses on his video games for hours. He can’t have ADHD.”  For the most part ADHD poses problems with tasks that require focused attention over long periods, not so much for activities that are highly engaging or stimulating. School can be especially challenging for a person with ADHD because the typical classroom lecture, compared with a video game, can be relatively unstimulating in terms of visuals, sound, and physical activity. Assignments can be long and require sustained, organized thought and effort, and the daily routine can be less structured and predictable than a child with ADHD might require. Most children with ADHD are diagnosed during their school years precisely because the academic, social, and behavioral demands during these years are so difficult for them. The difficulties that such children experience may make it seem that school is the problem (and, certainly, that possibility should be considered), but it is more likely to be a result of the child’s struggle to manage in this environment. Other situations that can be problematic for children with ADHD include social interactions, with their constant, subtle exchange of emotional and social information; sports that require a high degree of focus or concentration; and extracurricular activities that require them to sit still, listen, or wait their turn for long periods. “ ADHD is caused  by poor parental discipline.”  Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is not a result of poor discipline—although behaviors that stem from ADHD can challenge otherwise effective parenting styles. Inconsistent limit-setting and other ineffective parenting practices can, however, worsen its expression. You will find a number of proven parenting techniques that can help children with ADHD manage their behavior. “If, after a careful evaluation, a child doesn’t receive the ADHD diagnosis, she doesn’t need help.”  Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is diagnosed on a continuum, which means that a child can exhibit a number of ADHD-type behaviors yet not to the extent that she is diagnosed with ADHD. This does not mean she needs no help coping with the problems that she does have. The family of a child who does not meet the criteria for ADHD but has similar problems may be offered pediatric counseling, education about the range of normal developmental behaviors, home behavior management tools, school behavior management recommendations, social skills interventions, and help with managing homework flow and with organization and planning. “Children with ADHD outgrow this condition.”  Parents and many doctors once believed that as children with ADHD enter adolescence and then move into adulthood, their ADHD will no longer be an issue. But recent studies have shown that some aspects of ADHD can persist well into adult life for as many as 85% of these children. Some adults can still benefit from the use of ADHD medication for the rest of their lives. Others have demonstrated enough improvement that this medication becomes unneeded depending on what occupation they choose and their ability to succeed in relationships and other social activities. No matter what the circumstances of particular adults may be, however, they can make adjustments in their environment, take full advantage of their own strengths, and lead very productive adult lives, even when aspects of ADHD still persist.

However, having a new driver in the family can be worrisome, especially for parents of teens with      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) . Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for U.S. teens. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) encourages parents to talk to new drivers about possible risks of impulsive, distracted, and unfocused driving.  ​The risk of a crash is 36% higher for teens drivers with ADHD than their peers, no matter their gender, age or driving experience.\t Medication Effectiveness on Driving Uncertain \t Medication  can help teens control ADHD symptoms. However, the benefit of medication on teen driving is uncertain. Many factors affect whether ADHD medication might help. These include the time of day, how long ago the teen took medicine and how well it treats symptoms. For example, drivers are more at risk of a crash in the late afternoon and evening. This is also when a teen's ADHD medication might have worn off. What Can Help Teens with ADHD?   Teens with ADHD might need extra behind-the-wheel training, a longer supervised driving period and medication adjustments.

        "content": "As the parent of a child with ADHD, you may already be aware of certain times of day that are more difficult than others. If your child has begun taking a stimulant medication, you may notice fluctuations in her attention and behavioral control throughout the day as each dose of medication begins to take effect, works well, and then wears off.  With stimulant medications, effects such as behavioral rebound (a short period of irritability or moodiness as the medication is wearing off in about 4, 8, or 12 hours) may lead to difficulties at around dinnertime or bedtime that had not generally occurred before.  You can help your child adjust to these changes by observing how and when her emotions and behavior tend to fluctuate each day and arranging her schedule as much as possible to accommodate these ups and downs.  If you know, for example, that she is usually somewhat unsettled and irritable for a half hour after her arrival home from school, schedule her homework for after that time. If her medication suppresses her appetite at certain times during the day, schedule meals to avoid these periods. Take special care to prepare her for transitions between activities because these are likely to be especially difficult times for her.  \t Another issue to consider is the way a specific length of time can sometimes feel to your child with ADHD. For a child who struggles with managing her behavior or retaining focus for more than a few minutes at a time, tedious, repetitive, or boring activities can seem exceedingly long and soon become absolutely unbearable.  Forcing your child to participate in such an activity (requiring her to sit still for long periods while you chat with a friend, introducing her to clubs or groups that involve little physical action and too much down time, expecting her to pick up all the toys at once in a disorderly room) will probably only lead to failure and the probability of subsequent punishment.  Even fun activities can be strenuous in the same way. For example, baseball, which includes long periods of inactivity while on the field, may not be as good an activity for children with ADHD as soccer, which has a much faster and continuous pace.  By avoiding such situations or breaking up activities (including homework) into short chunks of time, you can help your child experience success as she struggles to manage her responses. It may also help to let your child know ahead of time how long a particular activity will last, and even to place a timer in view to help her awareness of how much time has passed.  If she knows she has already been working on her homework or practicing the piano for more than half the allotted time, she may be able (with your support and coaching) to continue to the end.",

However, we still have trouble getting her organized around homework. We have tried setting up an office in her room, taking away all the distractions, keeping the area quiet, and not allowing the television to go on until all her homework is done. We don’t seem to be making much progress and, in fact, we are all getting even more frustrated because nothing seems to work. Her teachers still complain that work is not getting turned in, and her grades are still suffering in spite of her teacher always telling us how bright she is.\t There is no one-size-fits-all solution to the ideal homework setting. Some  children with ADHD  work inefficiently in an isolated, quiet setting like their room, and do better in the midst of some action, like at the kitchen table with a radio playing. You might need to try a few different settings until you find the most efficient one. \t In addition, you might need to figure out if any other factors are making homework difficult. Think about all the steps involved. Does your child know what all the assignments are? Does she bring the materials home that are necessary for doing the work? Does she have a nightly work plan that fits with her learning style? (She might need to schedule breaks between math and English, or between outlining the report and writing the first 3 paragraphs.) Does she have a system to check on whether all the nightly work is done? Is there a system for checking that her completed work gets turned in on the due date? How does she or you know that work is late? Have you or her teacher set up rewards for progress or consequences for late work? Is there a system for her teacher to communicate with you about late work? \t Once you have gone through this type of systematic list of questions, you can begin to solve the problem in an organized way—and you might discover some simple and obvious solutions.

        "content": "Children and teens with      attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  are more likely ​than other kids to smoke, drink, or use drugs. They experiment with all three at younger ages than those children without ADHD. They are also at a greater risk for developing a      substance use disorder .  However, just because a child has ADHD does not guarantee he or she will have      alcohol or drug issues  as a teen. The key for parents is to be aware of the link between the two, step-up prevention efforts at home, and seek professional help if a drug problem is suspected.  Why Are People With ADHD More Likely to Abuse Drugs and Alcohol? There are several theories as to why ADHD increases the risk for substance use: Impulsivity, poor judgment and school troubles that can go along with ADHD may increase the risk for initiating substance use.  There could be a            genetic link  between ADHD and the vulnerability for developing a substance use disorder.  Individuals with ADHD may try to use psychoactive drugs to self-medicate.   Early Treatment of ADHD May Decrease the Risk of Substance Abuse The timing of treatment matters. Children treated at a younger age for ADHD may be less likely to develop substance use disorders compared to those who begin treatment later. Treatment may delay the onset of substance use. Treating mental health disorders that often co-exist with ADHD, such as anxiety and depression, is also important​ and may decrease the risk for substance use​.     Are Stimulant Drugs for ADHD Addictive?\t Stimulant medi​ations  are considered \"first line\" treatment for ADHD. No study has ever found that stimulant treatment      increases  rates of substance use disorders, however stimulant medications can be misused, abused, or given to others. Close monitoring is recommended to prevent misuse. Your doctor may question you closely if your child loses pills or runs out early as those can be signs of misuse.    Some types of ADHD medication are more likely to be misused compared to others. For example, short acting stimulant medications are abused more often than longer acting or non-stimulant medications. Talk to your child's doctor for more information about the risks and benefits of different types of medication used to treat ADHD.  Does Your Teen Have ADHD, a Drug Problem, or Both? Alcohol and drug use can cause symptoms that are similar to ADHD, including: Attention problems Difficulty completing tasks Disorganization Trouble sleeping Poor appetite  Reluctance to socialize with others Loss of interest in school  Discuss any new symptoms or a sudden change in ADHD symptoms during adolescence with your child's doctor. One of the big differences is ADHD starts in early elementary school while most substance use disorders begin in middle school and not first grade. What Parents Can Do: Pay close attention to any change in behavior, even if you think it could be attributed to your child's ADHD. \t Communicate  with your teen about safe and acceptable behavior.​​ Set an example by not misusing alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs yourself. Pay attention to your child's friends. If your child is hanging out with someone who is into drugs, it is very highly likely that your child may be exposed to drugs as well. Talk with your child about the importance of using all medications, including stimulants, exactly as prescribed. Discuss            side effects  and other concerns with your child's doctor.  Sharing, selling, or distributing prescription stimulants is always illegal and is dangerous. Keep a close eye on your teens' ADHD medication, as prescription drug abuse among teens is on the rise. Make sure your child understands that he should never give his medication to anyone.  Do not keep the medication in a public place such as in the bathroom or the kitchen or anywhere else people can see it. Make sure it's locked up or put away and monitored. Teach your kids to be responsible for their medication, too. Help her   learn to ​manage her ADHD and to own her condition, and be aware that she is at higher risk for certain problems.

        "content": "Children with  ADHD  frequently experience difficulty participating in elements of sustained and focused day-to-day conversation. But adapting your own style of communication to your child’s needs can help him maintain a connection. \t When necessary, pause to get your child’s attention (call his name before giving a command), maintain eye contact, and perhaps have him repeat back or explain what you have told him to be sure he has heard and understands. This approach works well not only when issuing commands but also when beginning any sort of conversation with your child. If he tends to interrupt, help him out by keeping your sentences brief and focusing only on what needs to be said. Avoid interrupting him frequently because he may not be able to stay engaged in this type of interaction.  If you sense that his attention is wandering, touch his arm, take his hand, or otherwise make physical contact.  Some parents find that conversation flows more smoothly if they are also involved in a  physical activity  with their child, such as washing dishes or making dinner. Finally, if you are telling your child something that you want him to remember, write it down in simple terms or encourage him to write it down himself. \t Introducing concepts such as “consequences,” “rewards,” and “positive and negative behavior” into the family vocabulary can go a long way toward clarifying communications. Where you might have previously instructed your child to “Go to your room!” following an unacceptable behavior, you can now inform him that his behavior has led to a “time-out”—and by the time you give this command, he will know the exact rules that apply to this term. \t Specific  behavior therapy  language strategies, such as when/then statements (“When you finish your homework, then you can go play baseball.”) may also prove useful when interacting with all of your children and can  improve communication  and morale in the family as a whole.",

However, when put to the test, the sugar-behavior link does not hold up. \t In a carefully controlled study of  preschool  and  school-aged children , researchers found no effect on behavior or ability to concentrate when sugar intake was far above normal, even among those whom parents identified as “sugar sensitive.” Another study found that sugar had the opposite effect to what was expected—when boys whose parents believed them to be sugar reactive were each given a large dose of sugar, they were actually less active than before. Finally, several studies comparing blood glucose levels have found that children with  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  have exactly the same response to sugar consumption as do children without ADHD. There is no scientific basis for claims that sugar and other  sweeteners  influence behavior or  cause ADHD , even at levels many times higher than in a normal diet. The overactivity children show after a birthday party or  Halloween  may be due more to the stimulation of the event than the sugar.\t Special Diets\t Special diets for hyperactivity are based on the belief that  allergies  or  reactions to foods  cause undesirable behavior. The diets typically target artificial additives, sugar, or the commonly allergenic foods (ie, corn, nuts, chocolate, shellfish, and wheat). However, there is no evidence that links foods and behavior. \t Some studies show that chemical preservatives or dyes, presumably through a drug rather than allergic mechanism, might contribute to these problems, but the evidence is weak and not widely accepted by experts.  Therefore, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend special diets for treating hyperactivity.  If your child behaves oddly or has unusual symptoms after eating a particular food, it will do no harm to avoid it, provided his diet includes other choices from the same  food group .",

        "content": "Most experts recommend using both behavior therapy and medication to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ). Here's what families need to know about behavior therapy and how it works. What is behavior therapy? Behavior therapy  focuses on how important people and places in the child's life can adapt to help them improve their attention and activity. It differs from  play therapy  or other therapies that focus mainly on the child and their emotions. Behavior therapy is based on three basic principles and strategies:\t Set specific, doable goals.  Set clear and reasonable goals for your child, such as staying focused on homework for a certain amount of time or sharing toys with friends.\t Provide rewards and consequences . Give your child a specified reward ( positive reinforcement ) every time they show the desired behavior. Give your child a consequence (unwanted result or punishment) consistently when they display inappropriate behaviors. Sometimes when you start using a punishment, the behavior may increase before it starts to decrease and disappear.\t Keep using the rewards and consequences.  Using the rewards and consequences consistently for a long time will  shape your child's behavior  in a positive way. How can behavior therapy help my child? With behavior therapy techniques like these, parents, teachers and other caregivers learn better ways to work with and relate to the child with ADHD.  You will learn how to set and enforce rules, help your child understand what they need to do, use discipline effectively, and encourage good behavior. Your child will learn better ways to control their behavior as a result. You will learn how to be more consistent. How are parents involved in behavior therapy? As their child's primary caregivers, parents play a major role in behavior ­therapy. Parent training is available to help you learn more about ADHD and specific, positive ways to respond to ADHD-type behaviors. This will help your child improve. In many cases parenting classes with other parents will be sufficient. However, with children who have more challenging behaviors, individual work with a counselor or coach may be needed. Taking care of yourself  also will help your child. Being the parent of a child with ADHD can be challenging. It can test the limits of even the best parents. Parent training and support groups made up of other families with children who have ADHD can be a great source of help. Learn stress-­management techniques to help you respond calmly to your child. Seek counseling if you feel overwhelmed or hopeless. Ask your pediatrician to help you find parent training, counseling and support groups in your community.  10 tips help your child control their behavior\t Keep your child on a daily schedule.  Try to keep the time that your child wakes up, eats, bathes, leaves for school and goes to sleep the same each day.\t Cut down on distractions.  Loud music, computer games, and TV can be overstimulating to your child. Make it a rule to keep digital screens and music off during mealtimes and while your child is doing homework. Don't place a TV in your child's bedroom. (See \" Make a Family Media Plan .\")\t Organize your house . If your child has specific and logical places to keep their schoolwork, toys and clothes, they are less likely to lose them. Save a spot near the front door for their school backpack so they can grab it on the way out the door.\t Reward positive behavior . Offer kind words, hugs or small prizes for reaching goals in a timely manner or showing desired behavior. Praise and reward your child's efforts to pay attention.\t Set small, reachable goals . Aim for slow progress rather than instant results. Be sure that your child understands that they can take small steps toward learning to control themself.\t Help your child stay \"on task.\"  Use charts and checklists to track progress with homework or    chores . Keep instructions brief. Offer ­frequent, friendly reminders.\t Limit choices.  Help your child learn to make good decisions by ­giving him only 2 or 3 options at a time.\t Find activities at which your child can succeed . All children need to experience success to feel good about themselves.\t Use calm discipline . Use consequences such as time-out, removing the child from the situation, or distraction. Sometimes it is best to simply ignore the behavior. Physical punishment, such as spanking or slapping, is not helpful. Discuss your child's behavior with him when both of you are calm.\t Reach out to teachers.  This can help develop a good communication system   so that you can coordinate your efforts and monitor your child's progress.

        "content": "​Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurobiologic condition whose symptoms are also dependent on the child's environment.  ADHD is now one of the most common and most studied conditions of childhood. Research to date has shown ADHD may be caused by a number of things: \t Brain anatomy and function.  A lower level of activity in the parts of the brain that control attention and activity level may be associated with ADHD.            See \t   ADHD and the Brain  from Understood.org. \t Genes and heredity . ADHD frequently runs in families. A child with ADHD has a 1 in 4 chance of having a parent with ADHD. It’s also likely that another close family member, such as a sibling, will also have ADHD. Sometimes,  ADHD is diagnosed in a parent            at the same time  it is diagnosed in the child.            See  Inheriting Mental Disorders .\t Significant head injuries  may cause ADHD in some cases.\t Prematurity  increases the risk of developing ADHD.\t Prenatal exposures , such as alcohol or nicotine from smoking, increase the risk of developing ADHD. In very rare cases,  toxins in the environment  may lead to ADHD. For instance,  lead in the body  can affect child development and behavior.            ​               There is  no evidence  that ADHD is caused by: \t   Eating too much sugar\t  \t   Food additives\t  \t   Allergies\t  \t   Immunizations Why do so many children have ADHD? The number of children getting treatment for ADHD has risen. It is not clear whether more children have ADHD or more children are receiving a diag­nosis of ADHD. Also, more children with ADHD are getting treatment for a longer period. \t According to national data, ADHD affects about 9.4% of U.S. children ages 2-17―including 2.4% of children ages 2-5 and 4%-12% of school-aged children. Boys are more than twice as likely as girls to be diagnosed with ADHD. Both boys and girls with the disorder typically show symptoms of an additional mental disorder and may also have learning and language problems.\t Because of more awareness and better ways of diagnosing and treating this disorder, more children are being helped.  It may also be the case that school performance has become more important because of the higher ­technical demand of many jobs, and ADHD frequently interferes with school functioning.  Additional Information: Understanding ADHD: Information for Parents\t What Causes ADHD?

        "content": "For most children, stimulant medications are a safe and effective way to relieve attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) symptoms. As glasses help people focus their eyes to see, these medications help children with ADHD focus their thoughts better and ignore distractions. This makes them more able to pay attention and control their behavior. With an ongoing shortage of some ADHD medications, pharmacies may be out of stock. If you are having trouble filling your child's prescription,    here  are steps that can help.      Stimulants may be used alone or combined with behavior therapy to treat children with ADHD. Studies show that about 80% of children with ADHD who are treated with stimulants improve a great deal once the right medication and dose are determined. Two forms of stimulants are available:\t Immediate-release (short-acting) medications  usually are taken every 4 hours, when needed. They are the cheapest of the medications. Extended-release medications usually are taken once in the morning. \t Extended-release (intermediate-acting and long-acting) medications  are usually taken once in the morning. Children who take extended-release forms of stimulants can avoid taking medication at school or after school. It is important not to chew or crush extended-release capsules or tablets, unless it is labeled as a chewable form. However, three are extended-release capsules that are made up of beads can be opened and sprinkled onto food for children who have difficulties swallowing tablets or capsules. \t Non-stimulant  ADHD medication can be tried when stimulant medications don't work or cause bothersome side effects.

It may take some time to find the best medication, dosage, and schedule for your child. Be patient with the process. Your child may need to try different types of stimulants or other medication. Some children respond to one type of stimulant but not another.\t What dosage?  The amount of medication (dosage) that your child needs also may need to be adjusted. The dosage is not based solely on his weight. Your pediatrician will vary the dosage over time to get the best results and control possible side effects. \t When to give it?  The medication schedule also may be adjusted depending on the target ­outcome. For example, if the goal is to get relief from symptoms mostly at school, your child may take the medication only on school days. \t Is it working?  It is important for your child to have regular medical checkups to monitor how well the medication is working and check for possible side effects. Is there a shortage of Adderall? In 2022, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration    announced  a shortage of immediate release formulation of amphetamine mixed salts. These are often referred to by the brand name Adderall or Adderall IR. Amphetamine mixed salts, including Adderall, are FDA-approved for the treatment of ADHD and    narcolepsy . \t The  shortage   of Adderall and some other ADHD medications has continued. Talk with your pediatrician  about alternative therapies available, such as the extended-release version of amphetamine mixed salts. They can advise which may work best for your child until the shortage eases and discuss other supports like    behavior therapy . What side effects can stimulants cause? Side effects occur sometimes. These tend to happen early in treatment and are usually mild and short-lived, but in rare cases they can be prolonged or more severe.  The most common side effects include:  Decreased appetite/weight loss Sleep problems Social withdrawal Some less common side effects include:  Rebound effect (increased activity or a bad mood as the medication wears off) Transient muscle movements or sounds called tics Minor growth delay The same sleep problems do not exist for atomoxetine, but initially it may make your child sleepy or upset her stomach. There have been very rare cases of atomoxetine needing to be stopped because it was causing liver damage. Rarely atomoxetine increased thoughts of suicide. Guanfacine and clonidine can cause drowsiness, fatigue, or a decrease in blood pressure.  Most side effects can be relieved by:  Changing the medication dosage Adjusting the schedule of medication Using a different stimulant or trying a non-stimulant Monitoring the effects of your child's medication Close contact with your pediatrician is needed until you find the best medication and dose for your child. After that, periodic monitoring by your doctor is important to maintain the best effects.    To monitor the effects of the medication, your pediatrician will probably have you and your child's teachers fill out behavior rating scales, observe changes in your child's target goals, notice any side effects, and monitor your child's height, weight, pulse and blood pressure.  Stimulants, atomoxetine, and guanfacine may not be an option for children who are taking certain other medications or who have some medical conditions, such as some forms of congenital heart disease.  More than half of children who have tic disorders, such as Tourette syndrome, also have ADHD. \t Tourette syndrome  is an inherited condition associated with frequent tics and unusual vocal sounds. The effect of stimulants on tics is not predictable, although most studies indicate that stimulants are safe for children with ADHD and tic disorders in most cases. It is also possible to use non-stimulant medications such as atomoxetine or guanfacine for ­children with ADHD and Tourette syndrome. Are children getting high on stimulant medications? When taken as directed by a doctor, there is no evidence that children are getting high on stimulant drugs such as methylphenidate and amphetamine. At therapeutic doses, these drugs also do not sedate or tranquilize children and do not increase the risk of addiction.  Stimulants are classified as Schedule II drugs by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. This is because there is abuse potential of this class of medication.    If your child is on this medication, it is always best to supervise the use of the medication closely . Atomoxetine and guanfacine are not Schedule II drugs because they don't have abuse potential, even in adults.  Are stimulant medications gateway drugs leading to illegal drug or alcohol abuse? People with ADHD are naturally impulsive and tend to take risks. But patients with ADHD who are taking stimulants are not at a greater risk and actually may be at a lower risk of using other drugs. Children and teenagers who have ADHD and also have coexisting conditions may be at ­higher risk for drug and alcohol abuse, regardless of the medication used.    See \" ADHD and Substance Use Disorder: The Link Parents Need to Know \"  for more information. Unproven ADHD treaments There is    no  scientific evidence that the following methods work and they are    not  recommended. Megavitamins and mineral supplements Anti–motion-sickness medication (to treat the inner ear) Treatment for candida yeast infection EEG biofeedback (training to increase brain-wave activity) Applied kinesiology (realigning bones in the skull) Reducing sugar consumption Optometric vision training (asserts that faulty eye movement and sensitivities cause the behavior problems) Always talk with your pediatrician about any    alternative therapies , supplements or medications that your child is using. These may interact with prescribed medications and harm your child.

        "content": "As part of the diagnosis, your ­pediatrician will look for other conditions that show the same types of ­symptoms as  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) . Your child may simply have a different condition or ADHD and another condition. Most children with a diagnosis of ADHD have at least one coexisting ­condition.  Common coexisting conditions of ADHD:  Learning disabilities —Learning disabilities are conditions that make it ­difficult for a child to master specific skills such as reading or math. ADHD is not a learning disability. However, ADHD can make it hard for a child to do well in school.  Diagnosing learning disabilities  requires evaluations, such as IQ and academic achievement tests, and it requires ­educational interventions. Oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder —Up to 35% of ­children with ADHD also have oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder. Children with oppositional defiant disorder tend to lose their temper easily and annoy people on purpose, and they are defiant and hostile toward authority figures. Children with conduct disorder break rules, destroy property, get suspended or expelled from school, and violate the rights of other people. Children with coexisting conduct disorder are at much higher risk for getting into trouble with the law or having substance abuse problems than children who have only ADHD. Studies show that this type of coexisting condition is more common among children with the primarily hyperactive/impulsive and combination types of ADHD. Your pediatrician may recommend  behavioral therapy  for your child if she has this condition. Mood disorders /depression —About 18% of children with ADHD also have mood disorders such as depression or bipolar disorder (formerly called manic depression). There is frequently a family ­history of these types of disorders. Coexisting mood dis­orders may put children at higher risk for suicide, especially during the teenage years. These disorders are more common among children with ­inattentive and combined types of ADHD. Children with mood disorders or depression often require additional inter­ventions or a different type of medication than those normally used to treat ADHD. Anxiety disorders —These affect about 25% of children with ADHD. Children with anxiety disorders have extreme feelings of fear, worry, or panic that make it difficult to function. These disorders can produce ­physical symptoms such as racing pulse, sweating, diarrhea, and nausea. Counseling and/or different medication may be needed to treat these coexisting conditions. Language disorders —Children with ADHD may have difficulty with how they use language. It is referred to as a pragmatic language disorder. It may not show up with standard tests of language. A speech and language clinician can detect it by observing how a child uses language in her day-to-day activities.

        "content": "​Your pediatrician will determine whether your child has ADHD using      standard guidelines developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics . These diagnosis guidelines are specifically for children 4 to 18 years of age.  It is difficult to diagnose ADHD in children younger than 4 years. This is because younger children change very rapidly. It is also more difficult to ­diagnose ADHD once a child becomes a teenager.  There is no single test for ADHD. The process requires several steps and involves gathering a lot of information from multiple sources. You, your child, your child's school, and other caregivers should be involved in assessing your child's behavior.   Children with ADHD show signs of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity in specific ways. See the behaviors listed in the table below. \t   Your pediatrician will look at how your child's behavior compares to that of other children her own age, based on the information reported about your child by you, her teacher, and any other caregivers who spend time with your child, such as coaches or child care workers.  The following guidelines are used to confirm a diagnosis of ADHD:  Symptoms occur in 2 or more settings, such as home, school, and social situations, and cause some impairment. In a child 4 to 17 years of age, 6 or more symptoms must be identified. In a child 17 years and older, 5 or more symptoms must be identified. Symptoms significantly impair your child's ability to function in some of the activities of daily life, such as schoolwork, relationships with you and siblings, relationships with friends, or the ability to function in groups such as sports teams. Symptoms start before the child reaches 12 years of age. However, these may not be recognized as ADHD symptoms until a child is older. Symptoms have continued for more than 6 months. In addition to looking at your child's behavior, your pediatrician will do a physical and neurologic examination. A full medical history will be needed to put your child's behavior in context and screen for      other conditions  that may affect her behavior. Your pediatrician also will talk with your child about how your child acts and feels. \t Your pediatrician may refer your child to a pediatric subspecialist or mental health clinician if there are concerns in one of the following areas: \t Intellectual disability  (formerly called mental retardation) Developmental disorder such as speech problems, motor problems, or a         learning disability Chronic illness being treated with a medication that may interfere with learning Trouble seeing and/or hearing History of abuse Major anxiety or major depression Severe aggression Possible seizure disorder Possible sleep disorder How can parents help with the diagnosis? As a parent, you will provide crucial information about your child's behavior and how it affects her life at home, in school, and in other social settings. Your pediatrician will want to know what symptoms your child is showing, how long the symptoms have occurred, and how the behavior affects your child and your family. You may need to fill in checklists or rating scales about your child's behavior.   In addition, sharing your family history can offer important clues about your child's condition.  Keep safety in mind: If your child shows any symptoms of ADHD, it is very important that you pay close attention to safety. A child with ADHD may not always be aware of dangers and can get hurt easily. Be ­especially careful around: Traffic  Firearms Swimming pools Tools such as lawn mowers Poisonous chemicals, cleaning supplies, or medicines How will my child's school be involved? For an accurate diagnosis, your pediatrician will need to get information about your child directly from your child's classroom teacher or another school professional. Children at least 4 years and older spend many of their waking hours at preschool or school. Teachers provide valuable insights. Your child's teacher may write a report or discuss the following ­topics with your pediatrician:  Your child's behavior in the classroom Your child's learning patterns How long the symptoms have been a problem How the symptoms are affecting your child's progress at school Ways the classroom program is being adapted to help your child Whether other conditions may be affecting the symptoms In addition, your pediatrician may want to see report cards, standardized tests, and ­samples of your child's schoolwork.  How will others who care for my child be involved? Other caregivers may also provide important information about your child's behavior. Former teachers, religious and scout leaders, or ­coaches may have valuable input. If your child is homeschooled, it is especially important to assess his behavior in settings outside of the home.   Your child may not behave the same way at home as he does in other ­settings. Direct information about the way your child acts in more than one setting is required. It is important to consider other possible causes of your child's symptoms in these settings.   In some cases, other mental health care professionals may also need to be involved in gathering information for the diagnosis.  Are there other tests for ADHD? You may have heard theories about other tests for ADHD. There are no other proven tests for ADHD at this time.   Many theories have been presented, but studies have shown that the following tests have little value in diagnosing an individual child:  Screening for high         lead levels  in the blood Screening for thyroid problems Computerized continuous performance tests Brain imaging studies such as CAT scans and MRIs Electroencephalogram (EEG) or brain-wave test While these tests are not helpful in diagnosing ADHD, your pediatrician may see other signs or symptoms in your child that warrant blood tests, brain imaging studies, or an EEG.   Additional Information on HealthyChildren.org:\t Understanding ADHD: Information for Parents  \t Causes of ADHD: What We Know Today\t Treatment & Target Outcomes for Children with ADHD\t Common ADHD Medications & Treatments for Children\t How Schools Can Help Children with ADHD Additional Resources: The following is a list of support groups and additional resources for further information about ADHD.

One reason for this delay is the fact that nearly all preschool-aged children often show some core behaviors or symptoms of ADHD—inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity—as part of their  typical development .  But as other children gradually begin to grow out of such behaviors, children with ADHD do not. Also in children with ADHD, those behaviors interfere with how well the child can function. This difference becomes increasingly clear as the years pass. When do symptoms of ADHD start to show? Starting school can highlight a child's challenges relating to inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. That's because classroom activities demand an increased amount of focus, patience, and self-control. These types of demands are not as frequent at home or in playgroups, so in those settings, the child may have had fewer problems. Usually by the time a child with ADHD reaches 7 years old, their parents are aware that their child's inattentiveness, level of activity or impulsiveness is greater than typical.  Sometimes these suspicions start later. This is particularly the case with bright children whose problems are mostly with paying attention and not hyperactivity. But it is unusual for ADHD symptoms to not have occurred before 12 years of age. So, if symptoms are not observed until the teen years or later, and can't be recalled before age 12, it is likely that something other than ADHD is causing the issues. How are ADHD symptoms different from typical childhood behaviors? You may have noticed that your child finds it nearly impossible to focus on a workbook for even a very short period, even when you are there to assist them. Or you may still feel as worn out at the end of a day with your overly active 8-year-old as you did when they were 2. Your child may ask adults questions so often that you have begun to suspect it is not \"normal.\" Or, you may have noticed that they do not seem to be picking up the nuances of social interaction that their playmates are beginning to adopt, such as respecting others' personal space, letting other people have a turn to talk.  It can be difficult for a parent to tell whether such behaviors are just part of the normal process of growing up (\"Plenty of six-year-olds get bored with workbooks!\"), or whether your child needs stricter boundaries (\"Maybe I've been too inconsistent with setting limits.\"). Are the behavior problems severe enough to indicate a concerning problem? Will they improve as your child matures? How does your child behaves in different settings? For a child to be diagnosed with ADHD, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises health care providers to gather information about the child's behavior in at least one other major setting besides their home—including a review of any reports provided by teachers and school professionals.  By comparing the child's behavior in 2 or more settings, the provider can begin to differentiate among such varied reasons for attentional problems as a \"difficult\" but normal temperament, ineffective parenting practices, inappropriate academic setting, and other challenges. The provider can also clarify whether the child's behavior is interfering with their ability to function adequately in more than one setting—another requirement for diagnosis. How ADHD terminology has changed over the years It can be hard to match the behavior we see in our children with the formal terms used by pediatricians and othe r medical professionals. We rarely think of our kids as having \"hyperactive-impulsive problems.\" Instead, we think, \"Why can't they ever settle down?\" To confuse matters, the terms that doctors use for these behaviors have changed over the years.  The term \"ADD\" (attention deficit disorder) was once common, and referred primarily to the form of ADHD with \"inattentive only\" symptoms. These children are not overly active, and their symptoms may even go unnoticed by dults for a while because their behavior is not disruptive. To most children with ADHD, the qualifying description of \"with hyperactivity\" had to be added to ADD. Now, all children with this condition are considered to have ADHD. However, within that diagnosis there are 3 subtypes: inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, and combined subtypes. ADHD symptoms & behaviors: what parents may notice Look at the lists below and ask yourself how many times per day or week you say or think the same things yourself. All parents make these sorts of comments about their children now and then, of course. But parents of children with ADHD continue to see the same behaviors on a daily basis and for extended periods-long after other children have progressed. Parents of children with predominantly inattentive-type ADHD say: \"They seem like they're always daydreaming. They never answer when I talk to them. I wonder if they hear me.\" \"They lose everything. I've had to buy four new lunchboxes since school started.\" \"I'll ask them to go up to their room and get dressed, and 10 minutes later I find them playing with their toys with only their shirt on.\" \"They can't remember what they learn because they miss instructions and explanations in school. Even though we work so hard on their schoolwork at night, by the next day they've forgotten everything.\" \"Some teachers have called them their 'space cadet,' an underachiever, an \"airhead' or their 'random student.' \"\t Parents of children with predominantly hyperactive-impulsive–type ADHD say:  \"They never slow down. You can never get them to sit down to finish a meal or get ready for bed.\" \"They interrupt constantly. You can't have a decent conversation when he's in the room.\"  \"They never think before they act. They know they shouldn't run across the street before stopping to look, but they do it all the time. I worry about them being safe—they just aren't.\"  \"They operate out of order—like, 'ready…fire…aim.'\"  \"Their classmates don't like them. He's always 'getting in their face.' No one invites them over to their house. They always have to be first and things always have to be their way.\" Remember Talk with your child's pediatrician if you have concerns about your child's    progress at school , social interactions, behavior or any other aspect of healthy physical and mental development.",

        "content": "Life in the workplace can be formidable for a young adult with ADHD. Not only is he exposed to the same social and emotional pressures as his peers on college campuses, but he must also perform in a work environment that typically provides few or no supportive services and where no one may know he has ADHD. He may find it more stressful than he had expected to arrive at work exactly on time, manage paperwork or other detail-oriented work, attend frequent meetings, meet deadlines, and otherwise conform to what can often be a noisy, stressful and, in some cases, physically inactive environment. While teenagers with ADHD can often perform as well as their peers, adults with ADHD who are employed full-time tend to switch jobs more frequently and earn less money than their colleagues.\t A young adult with ADHD will be more likely to start off on the right foot if he spends time during high school considering what types of jobs might best suit someone with his particular strengths and weaknesses and working on developing his time-management and selfcare skills. Career counseling services are often available through the high school guidance office, and may be mandated under IDEA. Any job can be made more “ADHD-friendly” if the employee with ADHD knows how to alter his environment to better suit his needs and to advocate effectively for appropriate accommodations.\t Coping With the Workplace\t A teenager or young adult with ADHD who joins the workforce but finds a job too difficult should get some help in analyzing where the job-related challenges lie. Is he overwhelmed by paperwork? Does he get in trouble for arriving late on too many days? Does he put off tasks and thus fail to complete them? Does he forget his employer’s instructions? Does he find it impossible to concentrate with all the noise around him? Is it hard for him to get along with coworkers or his boss?\t Once he has identified his problem areas, he can brainstorm on his own or with coworkers, a job coach, a counselor or a psychologist, a family member, or members of his treatment team about ways to address them. He may decide to use a daily planner or computer software to manage daily tasks and appointments. A watch with alarms or a timer can help him keep track of work arrival time or deadlines, and any number of handheld devices can be used to record tasks to be accomplished. He may choose to carpool with a coworker to help him get to work on time, and to take regular, brief “exercise breaks” to work off excess energy. \t Asking Your Employer for Help\t If these self-help techniques prove insufficient, and if a young adult feels comfortable disclosing that he has some functional issues related to ADHD, he should consider asking his employer about accommodations that might be provided that could help him work at his best level. Accommodations might include a less distracting office or workspace, a daily review each morning of work to be done, help with breaking complex jobs into smaller tasks, or even flex-time or a transfer from a heavily detail-oriented, time-pressured job to one that better matches his strengths. It may be difficult for him to work up the courage to ask for such help at first, but chances are that his employer will make at least some effort to cooperate. \t His problems at work may have puzzled or displeased his supervisor if she did not previously understand their cause, and she will probably appreciate and respect her employee’s effort to improve his performance. As is the case in any aspect of his life, he is likely to meet with greater success on the job as he focuses on his strengths rather than his weaknesses. \t Adults with ADHD are often among the most creative, imaginative, energetic members of society. The more successfully he can understand and communicate to his employer his talents, strengths, and needs, the harder he or she may work to help him. It is important to remember, however, that ADHD symptoms are an explanation of why he is experiencing difficulty and not an excuse for them. The greater his understanding of how ADHD affects him and the better his self-esteem coming out of high school, the more likely he will feel empowered to effectively advocate for himself in a present or future job.\t An adolescent may be entitled to continue counseling services and assessment under an IDEA-mandated Individual Written Rehabilitation Plan. If this is not the case, however, he will need to be extra-vigilant regarding any ADHD-related concerns that are beginning to get out of hand, because routine accommodations are rarely provided by an employer. Make sure that your teenager has the names and phone numbers of physicians, job counselors, therapists, and other community resources who can help him with a variety of potential difficulties. The most helpful role as a parent may include providing nonjudgmental help or “reality checks” if he approaches you about these issues. Parents should remember that their role is to empower and not to enable or provide excuses for their adult child.\t If he is offered a health insurance plan by his employer, he should review it along with his job-related benefits to learn in advance what counseling or other support services he can obtain. He may also consider the possible benefits of using a coach to help with some of these transitions from adolescence to adult life. Again, a thorough understanding of his ADHD-related strengths and weaknesses, coupled with a determination to monitor and manage his symptoms, is the best way for your growing adolescent to join the ranks of other young adults with ADHD who enjoy stimulating, fulfilling, and successful careers.",

In some cases, symptoms may be better controlled as the child grows older; however, frequently the demands for performance also increase so that in most cases, ADHD symptoms persist and continue to interfere with the child's ability to function adequately.  According to the National Institute of Mental Health, about 80% of those who required  medication for ADHD  as children still need it as teenagers. Parents play an important role in helping teenagers become independent.  Encourage your teenager to help herself with strategies: Using a daily planner for assignments and appointments Making lists Keeping a routine Setting aside a quiet time and place to do  homework Organizing storage for items such as school supplies, clothes, CDs, and sports equipment Being safety conscious (e.g., always wearing  seat belts , using protective gear for sports) Talking about problems with someone she trusts Getting enough sleep Understanding her increased risk of abusing substances such as tobacco and alcohol Activities such as sports, drama, and debate teams can be good places to channel excess energy and develop friendships. Find what your teenager does well and support her efforts to \"go for it.\" Milestones such as learning to drive and dating offer new freedom and risks. Parents must stay involved and set limits for safety. Your child's ADHD increases her risk of incurring traffic violations and accidents. It remains important for parents of teenagers to keep in touch with teachers and make sure that their teenager's schoolwork is going well. Talk with your pediatrician if your teenager shows signs of severe problems such as depression,  drug abuse , or gang-related activities.

Vital energies can be restored through the use of diluted animal, plant, or mineral extracts designed to treat specific symptoms. These treatments have been shown to be more effective than placebos in reliable scientific studies, though the reason for this is not yet known. \t Homeopathic treatment for ADHD, increasingly widespread in the United States as individual accounts of success have spread, has been demonstrated effective in one initial study in improving ADHD-type behavior, although the study failed to use a fully double-blind design. \t Though the mechanisms underlying this treatment are still not scientifically defined, the success of the study merits further investigation of homeopathy as a treatment for ADHD, but it cannot be recommended as a proven therapy at this time. \t If you do become interested in using this approach, be sure to discuss your plans first with your child’s physician.

In fact, these principles work well in the classroom for most students.  Classroom management techniques may include:  Keeping a set routine and schedule for activities Using a system of clear rewards and consequences, such as a point system or token economy  Sending daily or weekly report cards or behavior charts to parents to inform them about the child's progress Seating the child near the teacher Using small groups for activities Encouraging students to pause a moment before answering questions Keeping assignments short or breaking them into sections Close supervision with frequent, positive cues to stay on task Changes to where and how tests are given so students can succeed (e.g., allowing students to take tests in a less distracting environment or allowing more time to complete tests) Federal laws to help children with ADHD: Your child's school should work with you and your pediatrician to develop strategies to assist your child in the classroom. When a child has ADHD that is severe enough to interfere with her ability to learn, 2 federal laws offer help. These laws require public schools to cover costs of evaluating the ­educational needs of the affected child and providing the needed services.   The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Part B (IDEA)  requires public schools to cover costs of evaluating the educational needs of the affected child and providing the needed special education services if your child qualifies because her learning is impaired by her ADHD. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973  does not have strict ­qualification criteria but is limited to changes in the classroom, modifi­cations in homework assignments, and taking tests in a less distracting environ­ment or allowing more time to complete tests.

        "content": "Learning Disorders\t Reading Disorders\t Reading disorders, the most common and best studied of the learning disabilities, account for 80% of all children diagnosed as learning disabled. Children with reading disorders are able to visualize letters and words but have difficulty recognizing that letters and combinations of letters represent different sounds. Most reading disorders involve difficulties with recognizing single words rather than with reading comprehension. The cause often lies in the area of the child’s “phonologic awareness”—difficulty perceiving how sounds make up words. Reading disorders—even including letter reversals—have little to do with vision. These problems make it quite difficult for children to add new words to their reading repertoire and become good readers. While their listening and speaking skills may be adequate, they may have trouble naming objects (such as quickly coming up with the word for “computer” or “backpack”) and/or remembering verbal sequences (such as “The boy saw the man who was driving the red car.”). A smaller group of children also have reading disabilities that involve comprehension, and these children tend to have poor receptive language skills—that is, difficulty understanding language even when it is spoken to them. A reading disorder, depending on how it is defined, is not necessarily a lifelong condition, but these problems do persist into adulthood in at least 40% of children.\t Like all other learning disabilities, reading disorders cannot be detected through neurologic tests, such as special examinations, electroencephalograms (EEGs: brain wave tests), or brain scans like computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. They are identified when a child’s reading level or language achievement scores are significantly lower than those of his classmates. In assessing reading disabilities, it is important to identify each component of your child’s problem so that specific treatment measures can be applied. It is also important to address the attentional and behavioral aspects of the ADHD so that your child can make optimal progress at school.\t Mathematics Disorder\t Mathematics disorder can be thought of as a type of learning disability in which spoken language is not affected, but computational math is. Children with mathematics disorder also may have difficulties with motor and spatial, organizational, and social skills. \t Children with coexisting ADHD, or even ADHD alone, can have additional problems in math—such as delays in committing math facts to memory, the making of careless math errors, rushing through problems and impulsively putting down the wrong answers or not showing their work, and making errors because they misaligned columns during addition or long division. Although math disabilities are about as common as reading disabilities, they are not well studied. It is not known whether math skills stem from the innate abilities of children to understand the concepts of magnitude or quantities and compare numbers, or whether they arise in brain areas that are responsible for language, visual-spatial, or attention and memory systems. \t It is generally agreed that children with mathematics disability have a deficit in recalling math facts. Accurate and fluent recall of single digit math facts is felt to be important in freeing up higher brain areas for learning and applying more complex tasks. Children with both reading and math disabilities struggle particularly with word problem-solving.\t Written Expression Disorder\t Children with written expression disorder can have difficulty composing sentences and paragraphs; organizing paragraphs; using correct grammar, punctuation, and spelling in their written work; and writing legibly. Children with spoken-language problems can develop problems with written language as well as math. Children with ADHD can also have difficulty with taking the mental time to plan their writing, and their handwriting can be immature and sometimes unreadable without necessarily having a written expression disorder. When handwriting problems are more a function of ADHD than a written expression or motor skills disorder, they sometimes improve rapidly and dramatically with appropriate stimulant medication treatment.\t Nonverbal Learning Disability\t Nonverbal learning disability is a condition that is not yet formally categorized as a disorder but that has been the subject of increasing interest. It is particularly important to consider in children with ADHD because it relates to attentional functioning. It is often difficult to decide whether a child with ADHD has a coexisting NLD or whether he just has an NLD that mimics ADHD—especially the inattentive symptoms.\t Nonverbal learning disability accounts for about 5% to 10% of children with learning disabilities. It consists of a cluster of deficits, including poor visuospatial skills, problems with social skills, and impaired math ability. Problems with disorganization, inconsistent school performance, and social problems may lead to an evaluation for ADHD. In some cases this makes children with NLD difficult to differentiate from children with Asperger disorder. General functioning in children with NLD younger than 4 years can be relatively typical or only involve mild deficits. Following this period, children can develop disruptive behavior and may develop hyperactivity and inattention. They are frequently thought of as acting out and hyperactive, and are commonly identified by their teachers as overtalkative, trouble makers, or behavior problems. As they grow older, their high activity level can disappear. By older childhood and early adolescence, problems can tend to be more internal, characterized by withdrawal, anxiety, depression, unusual behaviors, and social skills problems. Interactions with other children may become more difficult, and their faces can seem unexpressive. These behaviors can be accompanied by deficits in how they judge social situations, judgment, and interaction skills. Children with NLD are particularly prone to emotional problems over the course of their development, as opposed to children with other learning disabilities. Nonverbal learning disabilities are less prevalent than languagebased learning disorders. Where it is estimated that about 4% to 20% of the general population have identifiable learning disabilities, it is thought that only 1% to 10% of those individuals would be found to have NLD.\t Children with NLD are often not identified until late elementary school or middle school, when the peer problems increase and academic tasks become more complicated. They frequently develop symptoms of depression and anxiety.\t Academic Problems\t As was pointed out earlier in this chapter, children with ADHD frequently experience significant challenges at school and elsewhere that cannot be formally categorized as disabilities or formal disorders. Forty percent of children with ADHD, for example, who do not qualify for a diagnosis of learning disability still experience learning problems that lead to underachievement at school. These learning problems may include\t Inattention and distractibility\t Lack of persistence and inconsistent performance\t A tendency to become easily bored or to rush through or not complete work\t Impulsive responses and careless errors\t Difficulty self-correcting mistakes\t A limited ability to sit still and listen\t Difficulty with time-limited tasks and test taking\t Problems with planning, homework flow, and work completion\t Difficulty taking notes or performing other forms of multitasking\t Difficulty memorizing facts\t Difficulty organizing and producing written work\t Immature and slow handwriting that can also create obstacles in expressive writing\t Difficulty with reading comprehension\t Stimulant medications that decrease your child’s ADHD symptoms are likely to help her address many of these problems. Behavior therapy techniques aimed at increasing or decreasing specific behaviors at home and in school can also prove beneficial. Specific behavioral goals, such as improving completion of assignments, can be addressed by understanding your child’s individual strengths and weaknesses and collaborating with school staff in using positive reinforcement, appropriate behavioral techniques, daily report cards, and ongoing monitoring.\t Motor Skills Disorder\t Motor skills disorder, also known as developmental coordination disorder, is diagnosed when motor skills problems significantly interfere with academic achievement or activities of daily living. It is frequently overlooked in children with ADHD due to its nonspecific cluster of symptoms—yet it can affect children’s lives by interfering with writing and other academic activities or preventing children from participating at their classmates’ level in sports and play. Children with ADHD and other learning disabilities frequently have motor skills disorder as well. Motor skills disorder involves a developmental delay of movement and posture that leaves children with coordination substantially below that of others of their age and intelligence level. These children seem so clumsy and awkward they are rarely picked for teams at school. As the years pass, they tend to fall further behind in terms of motor skills, and their confidence diminishes as a result. By adolescence, most children with motor skills disorder not only perform poorly in physical education classes, but may also have a poor physical self-image and perform below expectations academically.\t Motor skills disorder may be first identified when a preschooler or kindergartner is unable to perform age-appropriate skills, such as buttoning buttons and catching a ball, or when an elementary school child struggles with writing or sports activities. A child with motor skills disorder may have difficulty with the mechanics of writing, with planning motor actions, or with memorizing motor patterns. While many young children with ADHD but no motor skills disorder may seem clumsy in their younger years, their awkwardness is related more to inattentiveness or impulsivity than to poor motor control and it is frequently outgrown. However, a child with ADHD and coexisting motor skills disorder may not outgrow his clumsiness.\t If your child is diagnosed with developmental coordination disorder, he may be referred to a pediatric occupational therapist for individualized therapy and, particularly if his deficits negatively affect his academic performance or daily skills, be recommended for special gym activities at school to promote hand-eye coordination and motor development and improve specific skills.\t Communication Disorders\t Communication disorders—conditions that interfere with communications with others in everyday life—involve not only the ability to appreciate language sounds (phonologic awareness) but also to acquire, recall, and use vocabulary (semantics) and to deal with word order and appropriately form or comprehend sentences (syntax). Subcategories of these disorders have been identified, including expressive language disorder, mixed receptive-expressive disorder, phonologic disorder, articulation (word pronunciation) disorder, and stuttering.\t Because there is such a close association between communication and social relationships, these language deficits are often accompanied by social skills difficulties. Children with ADHD without a language disorder may also have difficulties in using language, particularly in social situations. You may notice that your child has problems with excessive talking, frequent interruption, not listening to what is said, blurting out answers before questions are finished, and having disorganized conversations.",

        "content": "A number of proposed treatments for ADHD—including hypnotherapy, self-hypnosis, guided imagery, neurofeedback, and relaxation training—are aimed at helping a child begin to regulate his own behavior and psychological state. The fact that these techniques can be used quite successfully for children in other areas of self-regulation (headache management, teaching bowel control, etc) increases their appeal as a form of treatment.\t Hypnotherapy has not been shown to significantly improve the core symptoms of ADHD, though it may improve such accompanying problems as sleep problems and tics when used as part of an integrated treatment approach. One difference between the use of hypnotherapy for headaches versus ADHD is that children learn to institute the self-hypnosis at the early signs of a headache. There is no comparable “trigger” with ADHD, and children cannot do self-hypnosis all day long.\t Neurofeedback treatment involves placing electrodes on a child’s head to monitor brain activity. Children are asked, for example, to change the aspects of a video game (for example “making the sun set with your mind”), which happens when their brainwaves are of a desired frequency. The theory is that learning to do this increases their arousal levels, improves their attention, and results in reductions in hyperactive-impulsive behaviors. This is based on findings that many children with ADHD show low levels of arousal in frontal brain areas, with excess of theta (daydreamy) waves and deficit of beta waves (indicators of a highly focused mind), thereby reducing ADHD. The studies on the use of neurofeedback to date have been criticized for lacking the appropriate controls or the random assignment of test subjects to the treatment or sham treatment groups. It should also be pointed out that neurofeedback treatment is an expensive approach to treating ADHD.",

These include ADHD with accompanying    tic disorders  (such as Tourette Syndrome), for example. In some cases, these medicines can treat both conditions at the same time. Proven alternate choices of stimulant medications for children include   Atomoxetine,   Guanfacine XR and Clonidine XR.

Atomoxetine, guanfacine XR and clonidine XR are considered second-line (second-choice) treatments.  Products are mentioned for informational purposes only and do not imply an endorsement by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Your doctor or pharmacist can provide you with important safety information for the products listed.  Atomoxetine Atomoxetine (Strattera) is a non-stimulant approved by the FDA for the treatment of ADHD. It is in the class of medications known as selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Because atomoxetine does not have a potential for abuse, it is not classified as a controlled substance. Atomoxetine is a newer medication and the evidence supporting its use is more limited than for stimulants. Atomoxetine, unlike stimulants, is active around the clock. However, atomoxetine has been found to be only about two-thirds as likely to be effective as stimulant medications. After starting atomoxetine, it may take up to 6 weeks before it reaches its maximum effectiveness. Possible side effects Atomoxetine has a warning on it that it may, in a very small number of cases, have some potential for causing    suicidal thoughts  in the first few weeks of treatment. Atomoxetine may be helpful in the treatment of children who have both    ADHD and anxiety , since stimulants may worsen anxiety symptoms. Side effects are generally mild but can include decreased appetite, upset stomach, nausea or vomiting, tiredness, problems sleeping, and dizziness. Jaundice (turning yellow) is mentioned in a warning on the medication, but is extremely rare. Taking atomoxetine with food can help avoid nausea and stomachaches.  Atomoxetine should be used in lower doses in children also taking certain antidepressants like fluoxetine (Prozac) or paroxetine (Paxil), because they can raise the atomoxetine levels in the bloodstream.\t Atomoxetine is now considered an option for first-line therapy for ADHD, and is the first non-stimulant to fall into the first-line category.  Parents concerned about the possibility that    stimulants may be used for substance abuse  may choose atomoxetine as the first-line agent for their child. It is often used for children who have had unsuccessful trials of stimulants. Long-acting guanfacine Long-acting guanfacine (Intuniv) is in the group of medications known as alpha agonists. These medications were developed for the treatment of    high blood pressure  but have also been used to treat children with ADHD who have tics, sleep problems and/or aggression. It has recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of children with ADHD. Long-acting guanfacine is a pill, but it cannot be crushed, chewed, or broken and must be swallowed whole. Like atomoxetine, it is not a controlled substance. Possible side effects It does not suppress appetite much, so may be a good choice for children who lost a significant amount of weight when taking a stimulant. Side effects can include sleepiness, headaches, fatigue, stomachaches, nausea, lethargy, dizziness, irritability, decreased blood pressure, and decreased appetite. Although sleepiness occurs in a large number of children when children start taking long-acting guanfacine, it seems to get better as they continue to take it. It may take 3 to 4 weeks to see medication benefit. Long-acting clonidine Long-acting clonidine (Kapvay) is also FDA approved for the treatment of ADHD. It is taken twice a day while long acting guanfacine is once a day. Both long-acting alpha agonists have been studied for use alone or as an add-on to stimulants when the stimulant alone does not stop all the symptoms of ADHD. Two other shorter-acting alpha agonists are available for use, but not approved by the FDA for ADHD. These are clonidine (Catapres) and short-acting guanfacine (Tenex). These can be used as adjunctive medications, or if FDA-approved medications are not helpful.\t If no FDA-approved medication has been found helpful for your child, you should also consider whether ADHD is the \t   correct diagnosis , and whether additional coexisting conditions might be present.

        "content": "​Achieving  independence  is a primary developmental goal of adolescence.  Your teenager will experience this urge as strongly as his peers without ADHD, but his or her impulsivity, inattention, and aspects of delayed maturity may mean moving slower toward this goal.   Specifically, you may need to: Remove loss of privileges in response to a broken rule. Know that long-standing loss of privileges, however, harbors resentment and has little teaching value. Work at consciously modeling responsible behavior. Watch the video  Offering Boundaries & Being Role Models  for more information and tips. Break down tasks and responsibilities into smaller steps.  Reward  your teen for accomplishing them. Develop a plan for transferring  responsibilities  over to your teenager as he or she works toward independence. Addressing Your Concerns Directly  It's easy to imagine that a teenager would resent a 10:00 pm  curfew , if his or her friends are, for example, were allowed to stay out until midnight. Talk with your teen about the reasons if you worry about his staying out later.  You may be concerned that  parties  tend to get wilder after about 10:00 pm, a time where you have observed that his or her impulsivity usually increases, or that  driving  is potentially riskier late at night because his medication will have worn off by then. If your teen feels he or she is ready to take responsibility for staying out later, and you have made the necessary adjustments to ensure success (such as possibly changing his or her medication routine to enhance attention while driving), then extend the curfew for 1 hour. If he or she arrives home on time with no evidence of high-risk activity,  give praise . Reward your teen with a continued 11:00 pm curfew. Moving in these small steps allows you to continue to build a mutual trust and respect—vital for your teen's self- esteem. Providing Structure & Support During your child's earlier years, you were encouraged to actively monitor his or her behavior in the classroom and at home. Now that your teenager is growing more independent, you may feel it is time to stop this type of monitoring. However, many teens with ADHD continue to need more parental monitoring and structure. While it is best for parents of many other 15-year-olds to back off and let their child manage his or her own homework, for example, a teen with ADHD may need continued monitoring to see that he or she is completing work and turning it in on time.  While other parents may grow laxer about knowing where their older teenagers are every minute, you may have reason to continue monitoring where your teenager is, with whom, what he or she is doing, and when he or she will be home, particularly when you sense that he or she might be in a high-risk situation that may be difficult to manage. While monitoring is necessary, it must be done in a way that is also respectful of your teenager and his or her developmental needs. Establishing & Enforcing Rules Any teen might have an argumentative style, and your teen's resistance to your continued monitoring may lead to a great deal of boundary testing, negotiating, and possibly outright rebellion. When warranted, you may feel better— and will be able to save some energy—if you identify 4 or 5 nonnegotiable rules based on the issues you consider essential for your family.  You may decide, for example, that use of illegal drugs of any kind—including  marijuana ,  alcohol , and  cigarettes —will not be tolerated in your house, or that driving can only be done at times when  stimulant medication  still has an active effect. These strict, nonnegotiable rules should be reserved for critical issues of safety or family functioning. When you have arrived at the 4 or 5 basic rules, write them down and discuss them with your teenager. Explain that the trust built through compliance with these rules can open the door to negotiating the other freedoms he or she craves. Discuss the rewards for compliance (i.e. extended privileges in other areas) and the consequences (i.e. increased restrictions) for breaking these rules. Enforce these consequences consistently.  Catch your teen doing something good. Remember, rewards are much more powerful than negative consequences. Negotiating with Your Teen Once your teenager has shown he or she is able to follow these few essential  rules , you are likely to feel more at ease when negotiating other issues. Negotiation is based on the assumption that, as a teen matures, he or she will take a more active role in creating the rules by which he or she lives. It is important to establish the fact that as the parent, right now you assume the final responsibility for rules and consequences.  A good way to negotiate rules or solutions to family conflicts is to use a technique called problem-solving training. This technique consists of the following steps: Define the problem and its effect. Come up with a variety of possible solutions. Choose the best solution. Plan how to implement the solution. Renegotiate a new solution if necessary. When first attempting to solve problems in this way, it is best to start with issues that are important but not emotionally intense for your teenager or for you. Eventually you may become so adept at this rational form of problem solving that you and your teenager will be able to resolve arguments on the spot, in most cases, using informal versions of this technique. Providing Appropriate Consequences You will need to \"stick to your guns\" in enforcing the rules and procedures on which you have all already agreed. Provide rewards and consequences consistently, and as soon as possible after the behavior has occurred.  Pre–agreed-on losses of privileges, for example, may be temporarily losing car key rights for coming home late. The tighter the link between the behavior and the consequences the better. Try to let these negotiated consequences take the place of argument, recrimination, yelling, or nitpicking. Keep the conflicts and emotions out of it. Simply provide the appropriate response to keep family life relatively pleasant and upbeat. Fostering a Positive Attitude & Giving Each Other Breaks Research suggests that the presence of one fully supportive adult in the life of a child with ADHD is one of the key factors in determining that child's future success. Be sure to invest plenty of quality time in your teenager—and make it fun and rewarding for both of you.  Sometimes, when things get too tough at home, it is a good idea to take a break from one another. A weekend that you spend away can restore your awareness that your problems at home can be solved, and can give all of you the space you need to maintain a healthy relationship.  Parents need support too ! As any teenager explores newly accessible choices, he or she will inevitably make some good and bad decisions. This is a normal and an important part of becoming a responsible adult.

        "content": "You will find that your child’s ability to progress in nearly all areas of self-management and social interaction increases when his environment is organized and structured to meet his unique needs. If your child is physically impulsive or accident-prone, take the time to unclutter and safety-proof your home. Some children with ADHD may benefit from an orderly physical environment with a place for each object, while keeping the environment (eg, your child’s room) organized may be a hopeless task for others. Try helping your child organize his room at a level he can manage.\t Daily routines are an absolute necessity for many children with ADHD. Consistent limitsetting with predictable consequences, along with limited choices (not “What do you want to eat?” but “Do you want an apple or a boiled egg?”), also make your child’s world more manageable and help him meet his goals. Written lists of chores or other daily tasks are especially useful in helping your child keep track of what he needs to do, and is an excellent habit for him to carry into adolescence and adulthood.\t When considering how to structure your child’s day-to-day experiences, it may help to picture your growing child as a construction project in progress. The limits, lists, routines, and other measures you are putting in place today are like scaffolding that will provide the necessary support as he develops fully. As he turns these routines into daily habits and becomes more self-directed, some of these supports can be gradually removed while his underlying functioning remains well in place. (You may no longer have to create homework checklists with him, for example, because he has learned to make them himself.) Far from “babying” your child, helping to structure and organize his world allows him to add to his competencies and experience many more small triumphs, increasing his self-esteem.\t Just as you have observed that your child may feel less overwhelmed when his home life is well organized, so you may find that organizing your own family life as thoroughly as possible will help you feel calmer and more in control. (This is even more likely to be the case, of course, if you have ADHD.) With the number of medical visits, teachers’ conferences, and treatment reviews necessary to maintain your child’s well-being and continued progress, a family calendar including all scheduled activities can be an essential for many families. Daily lists of tasks to perform and errands to run will help you stay organized just as they help your child. Many parents find it worthwhile to devote a private 10 minutes to half an hour before the kids get up in the morning to “regroup”—thinking about everything that must be accomplished that day and arranging tasks in order of priority. Make sure that any plan is realistic and not overwhelming.",

        "content": "Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the outlook for most children who receive treatment for ADHD is encouraging.  While there is no specific cure for ADHD, but there are many treatment options available.   Each child's ADHD treatment plan must be tailored to meet his or her individual needs, starting with target outcomes for behavior.  In most cases, ADHD treatment should include:  A long-term management plan with Target outcomes for behavior Follow-up activities Monitoring Education about ADHD Teamwork among doctors, parents, teachers, caregivers, other health care professionals, and the child Medication Parent training in behavior management Individual and family counseling Treatment for ADHD uses the same principles that are used to treat other chronic conditions like asthma or diabetes. Long-term planning is needed because these conditions are not cured. Families must manage them on an ongoing basis. In the case of ADHD, schools and other caregivers must also be involved in managing the condition.   Your new role, your new parenting journey Educating the people involved in your child's life about ADHD is a key part of treatment. As a parent, you will also need to learn a lot about ADHD. Read about the condition. Talk with people who understand it. Get support. This will help you manage the ways ADHD affects your child and your family on a day-to-day basis. \t Step 1: Set target outcomes for your child's behavior At the beginning of treatment, your pediatrician should help you set around 3 target outcomes (goals) for your child's behavior. These ­target outcomes will guide the treatment plan. Your child's target ­outcomes should focus on helping her function as well as possible at home, at school, and in your ­community. You need to identify what behaviors are most preventing your child from success.  Examples of target outcomes for children with ADHD:  Improved relationships with parents, siblings, teachers, and friends (e.g., fewer arguments with brothers or sisters or being invited more ­frequently to friends' houses or parties) Better schoolwork (e.g., completing class work or homework ­assignments) More independence in self-care or homework (e.g., getting ready for school in the morning without supervision) Improved self-esteem (e.g., increase in feeling that she can get her work done) Fewer disruptive behaviors (e.g., decrease in the number of times she ­refuses to obey rules) Safer behavior in the community (e.g., when crossing streets) The target outcomes should be:   Realistic Something your child will be able to do Behaviors that you can observe and count (e.g., with rating scales) Your child's treatment plan will be set up to help her achieve these goals.  Is your child's treatment plan working? \t Ongoing monitoring of your child's behavior and medications is required to find out if the treatment plan is working. Office visits, phone conversations, behavior checklists, written reports from teachers, and behavior report cards are common tools for following the child's progress. \t Treatment plans for ADHD usually require long-term efforts on the part of families and schools.  Medication schedules may be complex. Behavior ­therapies require education and patience. Sometimes it can be hard for everyone to stick with it. Your efforts play an important part in building a healthy future for your child.  \t Ask your pediatrician to help you find ways to keep your child's ­treatment plan on track.   What if my child does not reach his or her target ­outcomes? Most school-age children with ADHD respond well when their ­treatment plan includes both medication and behavior therapy.  If your child is not achieving his or her goals, your pediatrician will assess the following factors:  Were the target outcomes realistic? Is more information needed about the child's behavior? Is the diagnosis correct? Is another condition hindering treatment? Is the treatment plan being followed? Has the treatment failed? While treatment for ADHD should improve your child's behavior, it may not completely eliminate the symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Children who are being treated successfully may still have trouble with their friends or schoolwork.  However, if your child clearly is not meeting his specific target outcomes, your pediatrician will need to reassess the treatment plan.  ​Unproven ADHD Treatments\t You may have heard media reports or seen advertisements for \"miracle cures\" for ADHD. Carefully research any such claims. Consider whether the source of the information is valid. \t   At this time, there is no scientifically-proven cure ADHD.   There is  no  scientific evidence that the following methods work and they are  not  recommended.\t Megavitamins and mineral supplements\t Anti–motion-sickness medication (to treat the inner ear)\t Treatment for candida yeast infection\t EEG biofeedback (training to increase brain-wave activity)\t Applied kinesiology (realigning bones in the skull)\t Reducing sugar consumption\t Optometric vision training (asserts that faulty eye movement and sensitivities cause the behavior problems)\t Always tell your pediatrician about any alternative therapies, supplements, or medications that your child is using. These may interact with prescribed medications and harm your child.  Will there be a cure for ADHD soon? While there are no signs of a cure at this time, research is ongoing to learn more about the role of the brain in ADHD and the best ways to treat the ­disorder. Additional research is looking at the long-term outcomes for people with ADHD.  Will my child outgrow ADHD? ADHD continues into adulthood in most cases. However, by developing their strengths, structuring their environments, and using medication when needed, adults with ADHD can lead very productive lives. In some careers, having a high-energy behavior pattern can be an asset.   Additional Information:\t Understanding ADHD: Information for Parents ​\t How is ADHD Treated?

        "content": "Almost all children have times when their behavior veers out of control. They may speed about in constant motion, make noise nonstop, refuse to wait their turn, and crash into everything around them. At other times they may drift as if in a daydream, unable to pay attention or finish what they start.   However, for some children, these kinds of behaviors are more than an occasional problem. Children with  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  have behavior problems that are so frequent and severe that they interfere with their ability to live normal lives.  \t According to national data, ADHD affects about 9.4% of U.S. children ages 2-17―including 2.4% of children ages 2-5 and 4%-12% of school-aged children. Boys are more than twice as likely as girls to be diagnosed with ADHD. Both boys and girls with the disorder typically show symptoms of an additional mental disorder and may also have learning and language problems. ADHD is a chronic condition of the brain that makes it difficult for children to control their behavior.  The condition affects behavior in specific ways. For example, children with ADHD often have trouble getting along with siblings and other children at school, at home, and in other settings. Those who have trouble paying attention usually have trouble learning. An impulsive nature may put them in actual physical danger. Because children with ADHD have difficulty controlling this behavior, they may be labeled \"bad kids\" or \"space cadets.\"  Effective treatment is available. If your child has ADHD, your pedia­trician can offer a long-term treatment plan to help your child lead a happy and healthy life. As a parent, you have a very important role in this treatment.   Left untreated, ADHD in some children will continue to cause ­serious, lifelong ­problems, such as poor grades in school, run-ins with the law, failed relationships, and the inability to keep a job.  ADHD includes 3 groups of behavior symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.\t Symptoms of ADHD\t Behavior symptom: \t How a child with this symptom may behave: \t Inattention Often has a hard time paying attention, daydreams  Often does not seem to listen Is easily distracted from work or play Often does not seem to care about details, makes careless mistakes  Frequently does not follow through on instructions or finish tasks Is disorganized  Frequently loses a lot of important things Often forgets things  Frequently avoids doing things that require ongoing mental effort \t Hyperactivity Is in constant motion, as if \"driven by a motor\" Cannot stay seated Frequently squirms and fidgets Talks too much Often runs, jumps, and climbs when this is not permitted Cannot play quietly \t Impulsivity Frequently acts and speaks without thinking  May run into the street without looking for traffic first Frequently has trouble taking turns Cannot wait for things Often calls out answers before the question is complete Frequently interrupts others Not all children with ADHD have all the symptoms.  Children with ADHD may have one or more of the symptom groups listed in the table above. The symptoms are usually classified by the following types of ADHD: \t Inattentive only (formerly known as attention-deficit disorder [ADD]) —Children with this form of ADHD are not overly active. Because they do not disrupt the classroom or other activities, their symptoms may not be noticed. Among girls with ADHD, this form is more common.\t Hyperactive/impulsive —Children with this type of ADHD show both hyperactive and impulsive behavior, but they can pay attention. They are the least common group and are frequently younger.\t Combined inattentive/hyperactive/impulsive —Children with this type of ADHD show a number of symptoms in all 3 dimensions. It is the type that most people think of when they think of ADHD. If your child has shown symptoms of ADHD on a regular basis for more than 6 months, discuss this with your pediatrician. Realize, it is normal for all children to show some ADHD symptoms from time to time. Your child may be reacting to stress at school or home, bored, or just going through a difficult stage of life. It does not mean he or she has ADHD.  Sometimes a teacher is the first to notice inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity and bring these symptoms to a parent's attention.   Other times, questions from the pediatrician raised the issue. At routine visits, pediatricians often ask questions such as: \t \"How is your child doing in school?\"\t \"Are there any problems with learning that you or your child's ­teachers have seen?\"\t \"Is your child happy in school?\"\t \"Is your child having problems completing class work or homework?\"\t \"Are you concerned with any behavior problems in school, at home, or when your child is playing with friends?\" Your answers to these questions may lead to further evaluation for ADHD.

        "content": "​​By: Kelli W. Williams, MD, MPH, FAAP, FAAAAI​ Asthma is the most common chronic disease affecting children worldwide. About 1 in 12 U.S. children have asthma, according to the U.S.  Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention.  There is no cure for asthma, but there are ways to    control it . If your child has asthma, it is likely that one of the nine things listed here may cause it to flare up. These are called asthma triggers. Here is what you should know about asthma triggers and how to avoid them. 1. Viral infections  One of the most common triggers for an asthma flare is a viral respiratory infection. Any virus can cause an asthma flare. The most frequent is    rhinovirus —the virus that causes the common cold. Other viruses linked to asthma flares are respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ), influenza ( flu ) and    parainfluenza  infections.  Children who have an asthma flare caused by one of these viruses also have a harder time managing symptoms with their usual    treatment . This is called    treatment failure , and is often linked to hospitalization, emergency room visits, or relapse.  ​​What to do If your child has asthma and symptom​​s of a cold, watch for any signs of worsening cough, wheezing, or shortness of breath. If your child has to use his or her  rescue inhaler (albuterol ) more often, call your child's pediatrician. ​ 2. Tobacco & other pollutants  Pollutants can irritate the lungs and increase airway inflammation.    Tobacco  smoke is especially damaging to the lungs and can trigger asthma flares. Children who are exposed to    environmental tobacco smoke  have more wheezing, more severe asthma, and longer lasting symptoms. Other pollutants and lung irritants can cause asthma flares. These asthma triggers include ozone (smog), fragrances,    cleaning products , and chemicals. What to do Children with asthma should avoid being around tobacco smoke, including    secondhand  and    thirdhand  exposure. Consider using unscented products and try to ensure good ventilation when using cleaning chemicals.  3. Indoor allergens Asthma flares from indoor allergens are common in children with    allergies . These allergens include    dust mites , cockroaches, mice, and pet dander. They can trigger asthma flares year-round, and mostly are found in the home and in schools.​  What to do To control asthma, parents should control their child's exposure to the allergens. Solutions include using allergy-proof covers on bedding and washing bedding weekly in hot water to get rid of dust mites. A dehumidifier can also minimize indoor mold and mildew growth. 4. Outdoor allergens Seasonal exposure to outdoor allergens can also trigger asthma exacerbations.    Pollens and molds  are the most common outdoor allergens. Pollens include trees, grasses, and weeds.  Pollen seasons vary based on where you live. Most tree pollens shed in the spring, grasses in the summer, and weeds in the fall. Mold exposure can vary depending on the humidity and rain. Alternaria, a common outdoor mold, can make asthma symptoms worse.  What to do Like indoor allergens, the goal is to decrease your child's exposure to prevent asthma flares. If you know pollen is a trigger, it may help your child to wash off the pollen after being outside. For example, a grass-allergic child should bathe after playing soccer in the grass. Keeping windows closed during peak pollen seasons can also help reduce exposure.  5. Furry animals  Household pets are a common indoor allergen and trigger for asthma flares.    Cat  and dog allergies are the most common, but hamsters, gerbils, and rabbits can also cause symptoms. The allergens can be found in the pet's dander (skin), saliva (drool), and urine.  What to do If your child has a    pet allergy , strict avoidance of the animal is recommended. The home should be thoroughly cleaned if a pet previously lived there. A high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter also can help.  6. Cold air & changing weather Cold and dry air can be irritating to the lungs, cause airway inflammation and trigger asthma flares. This can happen on a cold weather day or even after exposure to a cold air conditioner. Sudden temperature changes can also trigger an airway spasm and worsen asthma. What to do Talk with your child's pediatrician or asthma doctor if your child is having weather-related flares to disuss adjusting medications.   7. Exercise When they    exercise , many ​people with asthma develop cough, wheezing, chest tightness and shortness of breath. Symptoms can start 5-20 minutes after exercising and be very intense. They may get better with rest or require rescue albuterol to bring relief.  What to do Some children with asthma need to take albuterol 20-30 minutes before activity to prevent an exercise-related flare. If your child frequently has asthma symptoms with exercise, talk with your pediatrician.  8. Insects Children who have asthma and are allergic to insects are at increased risk for an asthma flare after a sting. The kinds of insects that cause symptoms typically are flying venomous insects (like honey bees, wasps, hornets, or yellow jackets) and fire ants. Asthma symptoms develop very quickly after a  sting​ . What to do Sometimes, children need additional allergy medications to treat the reaction, including epinephrine and/or antihistamines. Children with asthma symptoms after an insect sting should see an allergist for evaluation. 9. Stress  Stress and anxiety can sometimes increase airway inflammation and trigger asthma symptoms. Children with asthma are increased risk for asthma attacks after a difficult life event (such as during the    COVID-19  pandemic or after the    death  of a family member). What to do Don't hesitate to talk with your pediatrician if you are concerned about how    stress and anxiety  is affecting your child's health and well-being, and ways to help build    resilience .  Remember Keeping your child away from asthma triggers can help prevent flare-ups. It can protect your child's airway from being inflamed and keep it from overreacting. This can reduce how often, how long and how severe your child's asthma symptoms are and improve your child's quality of life. Talk with your child's pediatrician if you have any questions about controlling your child's asthma.

Here are 7 tips on how to treat your child's allergies: Allergies can feel like a cold, and symptoms can include runny nose, stuffy nose, itchy nose and/or eyes, and sneezing. Some children may also have headaches and/or fatigue. Allergy symptoms can get in the way of school, fun and family time. Ask your pediatrician about medications to manage allergies. ​ Here are common treatments:​ Antihistamines : Taken by mouth, they can help with itchy watery eyes, runny nose and sneezing, as well as itchy skin and hives. Some types cause drowsiness. Nasal Corticosteroids : Highly effective for allergy symptom control and widely used to stop chronic symptoms. Safe to use in children over long periods of time. Must be used daily for maximal effectiveness. Knowing what your child is allergic to can be an important step in finding the right treatment.  Allergy testing should be performed to determine whether your child is allergic to any environmental allergens.  Nasal allergy symptoms can be caused by a variety of environmental allergens including indoor allergens such as dust mites, pets, and pests as well as outdoor allergens such as pollens. Molds, which can be found indoors and outdoors, can also trigger nasal allergy symptoms.   An important step in managing allergy symptoms is avoidance of the allergens that trigger the symptoms. If your child is  allergic to pets , the addition of pets to your family would not be recommended. If your child has allergy symptoms and is allergic to a pet that lives in your home, the only way to have a significant impact on your child's exposure to pet allergens is to find the pet a new home. If your child is allergic to pests in the home, professional extermination, sealing holes and cracks that serve as entry points for pests, storing foods in plastic containers with lids and meticulous cleanup of food remains can help to eliminate pests and reduce allergen levels. Dust mites  congregate where moisture is retained, and food for them (human skin scales) is plentiful. They are especially numerous in bedding, upholstered furniture, and rugs. Padded furnishings such as mattresses, box springs, and pillows should be encased in allergen-proof, zip-up covers, which are available through catalogs and specialized retailers. Wash linens weekly and other bedding, such as blankets, every 1 to 2 weeks in hot water. (The minimum temperature to kill mites is 130 degrees Fahrenheit. If you set your water heater higher than 120 degrees, the recommended temperature to avoid accidental scald burns, take care if young children are present in the home.) If your child is allergic to outdoor allergens, it can be helpful to use air conditioners when possible. Showering or bathing at the end of the day to remove allergens from body surfaces and hair can also be helpful. For patients with grass pollen allergy, remaining indoors when grass is mowed and avoiding playing in fields of tall grass may be helpful during grass pollen season. Children with allergies to molds should avoid playing in piles of dead leaves in the fall. Pets tracking in and out of the house can also bring pollen and mold indoors. Ask your pediatrician about  allergy immunotherapy . Immunotherapy, or allergy shots, may be recommended to reduce your child's allergy symptoms. Allergy shots are prescribed only for patients with confirmed allergy. If allergen avoidance and medications are not successful, allergy shots for treatment of respiratory allergies to pollens, dust mites, cat and dog dander, and molds can help decrease the need for daily medication.

Consider the following statistics:\t Some 50 million Americans have allergies (about 1 in 5 people in this country).\t The most common type of allergy is hay fever (allergic rhinitis); the medical cost of treating it, when direct and indirect costs are added up, now exceeds $7 billion a year.\t More than 17 million Americans have asthma, and about one-fourth of these are younger than 18 years. Asthma accounts for about 4,000 deaths a year.\t Seventy to 80% of school-aged children with asthma also have allergies, which are among the most common triggers for asthma, closely tied with viral respiratory infections.\t If one parent has allergies, there’s a 25% chance that a child will also be allergic. The risk is more than doubled to 60% to 70% if both parents have allergies.\t Many aspects of allergies, eczema, and asthma still are not fully understood. But advances in the  diagnosis  and treatment of these disorders are helping millions of sufferers.\t What Are Allergies?\t Many people mistakenly use the word  allergy  to refer to a disease or almost any unpleasant or adverse reaction. We often hear someone say, “I have allergies,” “He’s allergic to hard work,” or “She’s allergic to anything that’s green.” In reality, allergies are reactions that are usually caused by an overactive immune system. These reactions can occur in a variety of organs in the body, resulting in diseases such as asthma,  hay fever , and  eczema .\t Your immune system is made up of a number of different cells that come from organs throughout the body—principally bone marrow, the thymus gland, and a network of lymph nodes and lymph tissue scattered throughout the body, including the spleen, gastrointestinal tract, tonsils, and the adenoid (an olive-shaped structure that is located at the top of the throat behind the nose).\t Normally, it’s the immune system that protects the body against disease by searching out and destroying foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria. In an allergic reaction, the immune system overreacts and goes into action against a normally harmless substance, such as pollen or animal dander. These allergy-provoking substances are called a llergens .\t Who Is at Risk?\t Although allergies can develop at any age, they most commonly show up during childhood or early adulthood. A search of family medical histories of a child with allergies will usually turn up a close relative who also has allergies. If one parent, brother, or sister has allergies, there is a 25% chance that a child will also have allergies. The risk is much higher if both parents are allergic. But the child will not necessarily be allergic to the same substances as the parents or always show the same type of allergic disease (eg, hay fever, asthma, eczema).\t Symptoms Associated With Allergies\t Eyes, Ears, Nose, Mouth\t Red, teary, or itchy eyes\t Puffiness around the eyes\t Sneezing\t Runny nose\t Itchy nose, nose rubbing\t Postnasal drip\t Nasal swelling and congestion\t Itchy ear canals\t Itching of the mouth and throat\t Lungs\t Hacking dry cough or cough that produces clear mucus\t Wheezing (noisy breathing)\t Feeling of tightness in the chest\t Low exercise tolerance\t Rapid breathing; shortness of breath\t Skin\t Eczema (patches of itchy, red skin rash)\t Hives (welts)\t Intestines\t Cramps and intestinal discomfort\t Diarrhea\t Nausea or vomiting\t Miscellaneous\t Headache\t Feelings of restlessness, irritability\t Excessive fatigue\t When to Suspect an Allergy\t Allergies can result in various types of conditions. Some are easy to identify by the pattern of symptoms that invariably follows exposure to a particular substance; others are more subtle and may masquerade as other conditions. Here are some common clues that should lead you to suspect your child may have an allergy.\t Patches of bumps or itchy, red skin that won’t go away\t Development of  hives —intensely itchy skin eruptions that usually last for a few hours and move from one part of the body to another\t Repeated or chronic cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, nasal stuffiness, sneezing, and throat clearing, that last more than a week or two, or develop at about the same time every year\t Nose rubbing, sniffling, snorting, sneezing, or drippy nose\t Itchy, runny eyes\t Itching or tingling sensations in the mouth and throat\t Coughing, wheezing, difficulty breathing, and other respiratory symptoms\t Unexplained bouts of diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and other intestinal symptoms.\t Where Does Asthma Fit In?\t Although allergies can trigger asthma and asthma is often associated with allergies, they are actually 2 different things. In simple terms, asthma is a chronic condition originating in the lungs, whereas allergies describe reactions that originate in the immune system and can affect many organs, including the lungs. Many different substances and circumstances can trigger an asthma attack—exercise, exposure to cold air, a viral infection, air pollution, noxious fumes, tobacco smoke, and for many asthma sufferers, a host of allergens. In fact, about 80% of children with asthma also have allergies. Although allergies are important in triggering asthma, severe asthma exacerbations are often set off by the good old common cold virus, totally unrelated to allergy.",

        "content": "What Causes Allergies?​\t Children get allergies from coming into contact with allergens. Allergens can be inhaled, eaten, or injected (from stings or medicine) or they can come into contact with the skin. \t Some of the more common allergens are:\t Pollens from trees, grasses, and weeds\t Molds, both indoor and outdoor\t Dust mites that live in bedding, carpeting, and other items that hold moisture\t Animal dander from furred animals such as cats, dogs, horses, and rabbits\t Some foods and medicines\t Venom from insect stings\t Allergies tend to run in families. If a parent has an allergy, there is a higher chance that his or her child also will have allergies. This risk increases if both parents are allergic.\t How Can I Help My Child?\t Identifying and avoiding the things your child is allergic to is best. \t If your child has an allergic condition, try the following:\t Keep windows closed during the pollen season, especially on dry, windy days when pollen counts are highest.\t Keep the house clean and dry to reduce mold and dust mites.\t Avoid having pets and indoor plants.\t Avoid those things that you know cause allergic reactions in your child.\t Prevent anyone from smoking anywhere near your child, especially in your home and car.\t See your pediatrician for safe and effective medicine that can be used to help alleviate or prevent allergy symptoms.\t Common Allergic Conditions\t Condition​\t ​Triggers\t ​Symptoms\t ​Anaphylaxis\t ​Foods, medicines, insect stings, latex, and others\t ​Skin, gut, and breathing symptoms that may get worse quickly.

        "content": "Several effective, easy-to-use medications are available to treat allergy symptoms. Some are available by prescription; others,    over-the-counter . As with any medications, over-the-counter products should be used only with the advice of your child's doctor. Antihistamines\t Antihistamines , the longest-established allergy medications, dampen the allergic reaction mainly by suppressing the effects of histamine (itching, swelling, and mucus production) in the tissues. For mild allergy symptoms, your child's doctor may recommend one of the antihistamines widely available over-the-counter. Children who don't like to swallow tablets may prefer the medication in syrup, chewable, or melt-away form.  Antihistamines can be useful for controlling the itchiness that accompanies hay fever, eczema, and  hives . Your pediatrician may advise your child to take them regularly or just as needed. Antihistamine nasal sprays are also available for hay fever. They work locally in the nose to reduce symptoms. Some kids shy away from nose sprays and prefer using the antihistamines taken by mouth\t Some over-the-counter antihistamines, in particular the \"old-generation\" type, can cause drowsiness. For this reason, it's best to give the dose in the evening.  Some new generation antihistamines may cause mild drowsiness especially after the first dose. Ask your child's doctor whether these non-sedating antihistamines are appropriate for your child. Decongestants For  hay fever  sufferers, antihistamines help stop runny nose, itching, and sneezing, but they have little effect on nasal congestion or stuffiness. To cover the range of symptoms, an antihistamine is often given together with a decongestant, sometimes combined in a single medication. \t In contrast to older antihistamines, which tend to make people sleepy, decongestants taken by mouth can cause stimulation. Children taking these medications may act hyper, feel anxious, have a racing heart, or find it difficult to get to sleep.  Because of these possible side effects, it is best to avoid using long-term daily decongestants to control your child's nasal congestion, and instead, use another type of medication, such as a  nasal corticosteroid spray . Decongestant treatment can be given topically with nose drops or sprays, but these medications have to be used carefully, and only for a short while, because prolonged use can lead to a rebound effect. The resulting stuffy nose is more difficult to treat than the original allergy symptoms. Cromolyn Cromolyn sodium is sometimes recommended to prevent nasal allergy symptoms. This medication can be used every day for chronic problems or just for a limited period when a child is likely to encounter allergens. The medication is available without prescription as a nasal spray; it is taken 3 or 4 times a day. Nasal cromolyn has almost no side effects, but it's potency is not high, and because it requires frequent administration, it is hard to use on a regular basis in a consistent way. Corticosteroids\t Corticosteroids , a category of medications also called steroids or cortisones, are highly effective for allergy treatment and are widely used to stop symptoms. They are available as skin medications (such as creams and ointments), nasal sprays, asthma inhalers, and pills or liquids.  Steroid creams and ointments are a mainstay of treatment for children with  eczema . They control eczema when applied once a day, or even once a day, depending on the severity of the rash or even once a day if the rash is not severe. Nasal sprays that contain a compound derived from cortisone have become the most effective form of treatment for patients with nasal allergy problems.  Once-daily dosing is usually enough. These medications work best if used on a regular daily schedule, rather than with as-needed, interrupted dosing. No problems have emerged so far over many years in patients using cortisone nasal sprays over the long term. Allergy Immunotherapy Immunotherapy, or allergy shots, may be recommended to reduce your child's sensitivity to airborne allergens. This form of treatment consists of giving a person material he is allergic to, by injection, with the goal of changing his immune system and making him less allergic to that material.  Not every allergy problem can or needs to be treated with allergy shots, but treatment of respiratory allergies to pollen, dust mites, and outdoor molds is often successful. Currently, sub-lingual (under the tongue) immunotherapy is available for grass pollen and ragweed pollen only and is typically started a few months before the grass or ragweed pollen season.    Immunotherapy for cat (and possibly dog) allergy  can also be very effective, but allergy specialists advise that avoidance is the best way to manage animal allergies in children. Immunotherapy takes some time to work and demands patience and commitment. The treatment is given by injecting gradually stronger doses of allergen extract once or twice a week at first, then at longer intervals—for example, once every 2 weeks, then every 3 weeks, and eventually every 4 weeks. The effect of the extract reaches its maximum after 6 to 12 months of injections. After a number of months of immunotherapy, a child usually feels his allergy symptoms are better. Allergy injections are often continued for 3 to 5 years, and then a decision is made whether to stop them. Many children do fine after the shots are stopped and have little or no return of their symptoms.

        "content": "Although our knowledge of asthma is expanding year by year, many people still cling to outdated beliefs about the disease. Following are some that are often repeated:\t Fable: Asthma comes and goes.\t Fact :  Asthma is often an inflammatory condition that is always in the airways, even when the person is not having trouble breathing. Exposure to an asthma trigger can worsen symptoms, but the underlying condition never goes away, although it can be controlled with medications and environmental control measures. \t Fable: Asthma is an emotional disorder; it’s “all in the mind.” \t Fact:  Asthma is a lung disease; it affects the airways, not the brain. It’s true that symptoms may get worse when a person is under emotional stress, but this is probably more marked in adults and less so in children. Changes in the airways in asthma occur through physiological mechanisms, not emotional ones.\t Fable: People with asthma should use medications only when they have attacks; otherwise, the medications lose their effect.\t Fact :  Regularly using medications is the only way to calm the underlying airway inflammation and prevent asthma flare-ups. Used at the correct dosage, daily medications do not lose their effect or cause uncomfortable side effects. Effective antiasthma medications include inhaled beta-agonists such as albuterol to stop attacks, and inhaled steroids, long-acting beta-agonists, and leukotriene modifiers to prevent attacks from occurring at all.\t Fable: Asthma is just an annoying condition, not a real disease.\t Fact :  Asthma can kill when people do not get treatment to control the underlying condition and stop severe attacks. If everybody who needed medications used the proper ones to control symptoms and prevent flare-ups, hospitalizations and deaths from asthma would be greatly reduced.\t Fable: Children grow out of asthma.\t Fact :  Most people who have asthma are born with a tendency to the condition and keep it for life. It is true many children get much better with age, and their asthma appears to go away completely. However, many have it return in adulthood. Other children who still have asthma are less likely to lose their asthma as they go in to their adult years.\t Fable: Asthma clears up when you move to a warm, dry climate.\t Fact :  If the proper environmental measures are taken and medications are regularly used, people with asthma can live comfortably in any climate they prefer. Very rarely do people ever have to move out of a city or other area because of their asthma.",

It is also important that you are aware of your child’s symptoms and any problems with how your child’s asthma is managed in school.\t Effective Communication\t Good communication is essential to asthma care and management in school. The school needs to know about your child’s asthma, how severe it is, what medications your child takes, and what to do in an emergency. This communication can be helped by having your health care provider complete an asthma action plan for the school, as well as a medication permission form that includes whether your child should be allowed to carry and use her own inhaler. You should also sign a release at school and at your health care provider’s office to allow the exchange of medical information between you, the school, and your health care provider.\t Your child’s school needs to communicate to you its policies on how your child will get access to her medications and how they deal with emergencies, field trips, and after-school activities. The school should also inform you about any changes or problems with your child’s symptoms while she is at school.\t Peak Flow Meter\t Peak flow meters can be helpful for school staff in determining the severity of an asthma attack. If your child’s health care provider has recommended a peak flow meter, determine your child’s best peak flow (your health care provider should tell you how to do this). Then keep a peak flow meter at school. \t School Environment\t The environment at school is as important as the environment at home. \t Coping With Asthma at School\t Students with asthma face a number of problems related to school. Talk to your child about how well his asthma is being managed in school. Also talk to your child’s teachers, school nurse, coaches, and other school personnel to get their opinions on how well your child is coping with asthma in school and to see if asthma symptoms are causing any of the following problems:\t   Missing school due to asthma symptoms or doctor visits.\t Avoiding school or school activities. Work with your health care provider and school personnel to encourage your child to participate in school activities.\t Not taking medication before exercise. Your child may avoid going to the school office or nurse’s office to use his inhaler before exercise. Schools that allow children to carry their inhalers with them can help avoid this problem.\t Side effects from medication. Some asthma medications may alter your child’s ability to perform in school. Teachers need to know if and when your child takes asthma medication so that you can be notified if there are any problems.\t Physical activity is important for your child’s physical and mental health. Children with asthma should be able, and encouraged, to participate completely in physical education, sports, and other activities in school. All students should have some knowledge of asthma basics and management. Encourage your school to offer asthma awareness education as part of the health education curriculum. \t Know Your Rights\t Learn about the federal laws that can help you with asthma management concerns at school. These include the following:\t   Section 504 of the Civil Rights Act of 1973\t Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\t Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)",

        "content": "Corticosteroids\t Synthetic versions of hormones produced in the adrenal glands, corticosteroids are the most powerful anti-inflammatory medications now available for treating asthma. In inhaled form, they are used exclusively for long-term control; they are not very effective for acute symptoms. Systemic corticosteroids taken by mouth as pills or liquid, or injected, are sometimes of value to get asthma quickly under control when a child is beginning long-term asthma therapy. Inhaled corticosteroids are the agents preferred and recommended as first-line treatment of chronic asthma by various asthma expert panels that publish guidelines on the proper treatment of asthma. They are available in various forms and different dosage forms, which make them convenient for patients to take, such as an aerosol in a  metered-dose inhaler  (MDI), a  dry powder inhaler  (DPI), and a liquid form that can be used in a nebulizer for small children.\t Leukotriene Modifiers\t These compounds act by decreasing the effects of an inflammatory chemical made by the body known as  leukotrienes . The 2 leukotriene modifiers currently in use, montelukast and zafirlukast, are used as control medications. They have only mild to moderate beneficial effects at best but are very safe. They are taken in pill form; chewable and sprinkle forms are available for young children.\t Long-Acting Beta2-Agonists\t Medications in the beta 2 -agonist class work by relaxing the muscles that wrap around the bronchi of the lungs and tend to squeeze down and narrow the airways in those who have asthma. The short-acting forms of beta 2 -agonists, such as albuterol, are used as first-line agents for relief of asthma in all patients with asthma. Long-acting versions of beta 2 -agonists were made by making some chemical changes in the short-acting beta 2 -agonists. These long-acting beta 2 -agonists are almost always prescribed together with anti-inflammatory medications for long-term control, rarely if ever by themselves. They are usually added when a conventional dose of an inhaled steroid is not adequate for control of daily symptoms.\t There is evidence that rare patients experience loss of effect from their rapid-acting bronchodilator (eg, albuterol, levalbuterol) with taking long-acting bronchodilators. While this is quite uncommon, patients should be advised of this potential and instructed to notify their physician if the addition of a long-acting bronchodilator is associated with increased symptoms instead of the usual increased benefit.\t Theophylline\t Theophylline, usually taken by mouth as a timed-release pill, opens up the airways for an extended period. It can be used alone or together with inhaled corticosteroids. It can be particularly helpful in preventing nighttime symptoms in mild to moderate asthma. Although once used extensively, theophylline is currently infrequently prescribed for asthma, mainly because it requires careful monitoring of blood levels to avoid side effects and because other asthma medications often work as well or better.\t Cromolyn Sodium and Nedocromil\t These are very mildly effective anti-inflammatory medications rarely used anymore in long- term therapy of mild to moderate asthma in children.",

Children may use them by MDI or nebulizer; either form is effective if used properly. The medication should be available at home, in school, and at the site of sports participation. This class of medication used to be called “rescue” medicine, but this term is no longer used because it implies that a patient must be in terrible shape to use it, which should not be the case. The new preferred term is quick relief. It turns out that almost all patients use albuterol (or a close cous-in called levalbuterol, which acts very similar to albuterol) for their quick-relief medication.

Respiratory viruses and symptoms of early asthma may be hard to tell apart, making diagnosis and treatment tricky. But doctors and parents now have a tool to help them predict with reasonable accuracy if the child will develop asthma or simply outgrow it. The asthma predictive index (API) is a guide to determining which small children will likely have asthma in later years. Children younger than 3 years who have had 4 or more significant wheezing episodes in the past year are much more likely to have persistent (ie, lifelong) asthma after 5 years if they have either of the following: One major decisive factor Parent with asthma Physician diagnosis of eczema (atopic dermatitis) Sensitivity to allergens in the air (as determined by physician through positive skin tests or blood tests to allergens such as trees, grasses, weeds, molds, or dust mites) OR Two minor decisive factors Food allergies Greater than 4% blood eosinophils (a type of white blood cell often seen in allergic disease) Wheezing apart from colds The API was developed after following almost 1,000 children through 13 years of age. It turned out that a wheezy child with a positive API at around 2 to 3 years of age meant there was about an 80% chance that child would have a definite diagnosis of asthma when entering first grade. Using the API, doctors and parents can watch more closely for symptoms of asthma as the child grows and if needed, start the right medications earlier. Earlier and better treatment can help keep children active and healthy, and their asthma in good control.",

These additives are found in processed beverages and foods, including  fruit juices , soft drinks, cider vinegar, potato chips, dried fruits and vegetables, maraschino cherries, and wines. Numerous reports of allergic reactions—mostly among people with asthma—and of deaths associated with sulfite ingestion have led the Food and Drug Administration to ban the use of sulfites in fresh fruits and vegetables. Sulfites may be used in certain processed foods, provided they are listed on labels in quantities higher than 10 parts per million, or when used at all in manufacturing.

Although      asthma  is not always caused by allergies, 90% of children who have asthma also have allergies. And studies suggest up to 40% of children with asthma may develop allergy symptoms when they are exposed to cats.  How are allergic reactions caused by cats? Children sensitive to certain proteins (allergens) can experience an      allergic reaction . A cat's allergens are in its dander (dried skin flakes that get into the air or attach to its fur), urine, and saliva. The allergens are carried on sticky, microscopic particles through the air and land on all surfaces. That's why it is very hard to avoid cat allergens in a home. An allergic child who breathes in cat allergens can have itchy eyes, sneezing,      runny nose , a scratchy throat,      hives , and/or a flare up of asthma symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. ​How can I tell if my child is allergic to cats?\t   If you notice your child tends to start sniffling, sneezing or rubbing their eyes around cats, that could signal a cat allergy. But the best way to determine if your child is allergic to cats is through allergy testing, either with a  skin test  or a  blood test .\t Are some cats hypoallergenic?\t Since all cats produce cat allergens, there is no such thing as a non-allergic cat (or dog, for that matter).   Are there ways to decrease cat allergen exposure in the home? Cats live in more than      30%  of all U.S. households. Even when someone in the family turns out to be allergic, 25% of such families choose to keep their cat. There are possible ways to help minimize cat allergen exposure in the home that families can try, although studies suggest they may not be very effective. These include:  \t Keep the bedroom a feline-free zone.  Keep the cat out of your child's bedroom so she has a more allergen-safe zone, which is especially important when she sleeps. If you have forced-air heating and cooling in your home, the central systems should have a filter.  \t Bathe your cat often . Bathing your cat            at least once a week  may help reduce cat allergens, but there is conflicting research about how effective this is. And there's no evidence that giving cats a bath does enough to improve allergy or asthma symptoms for those sensitive to its allergens. \t Clean regularly . Sweep, mop, and vacuum the floors regularly. Use a HEPA filter for the vacuum and central heating and air conditioning systems to help reduce allergen particles. Clean furniture regularly, too, especially upholstered fabric that's more likely than surfaces such as wood, vinyl or leather to trap allergens. Consider replacing carpeting with wood, tile or linoleum floors, which are easier to keep clean. Make sure someone (other than your child with allergies) keeps the litter box clean.\t Remember hand hygiene . Teach your child not to touch her face when playing with or petting the cat, and to wash her hands right afterward.\t Worth a shot?  In some cases, when exposure to cats can't be avoided, your pediatrician            may recommend  seeing a board-certified            allergist  to discuss immunotherapy or allergy shots. These shots contain small amounts of the cat allergens that triggers your child's allergy and, over time, might help her body become less sensitive to it but doesn't work for everybody.\t Medications.  Allergy medications such as antihistamines and nasal corticosteroid sprays may help but can't always beat out exposure to cat allergens day after day. The fact is, children with asthma who are allergic to cats likely will need to be on higher doses of asthma medications than they would be without a cat in the home.  Remember Some research suggests young children who live with cats may be less likely to develop asthma and allergies later. But if your child already has asthma and has a positive cat allergy test, getting a cat will likely make his or her symptoms worse.  Unfortunately, taking steps to reduce allergen exposure in the home has not been found to be very effective. It might be a good idea to contact your local animal shelter or rescue organization to see if they let families foster pets before deciding to adopt. Even then, cat allergens likely will remain in the home for months even after a cat has lived there.

        "content": "What are corticosteroids? If your child has      asthma  or allergic rhinitis ( hay fever ), your pediatrician may prescribe a corticosteroid, also commonly referred to as a steroid. These medicines are the best available to decrease the swelling and irritation (inflammation) that occurs with persistent asthma or allergy.  They are not the same as the anabolic steroids that are used illegally by some athletes to build muscles.  The medicine works in 2 ways. Systemic corticosteroids must go through the body to treat the inflammation. Inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids go directly to where the inflammation is. In general, corticosteroids are safe and work well if the medicine is taken as recommended by your pediatrician. However, as with all medicines, you should know about the possible side effects. There are far fewer risks with inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids than with the side effects of systemic corticosteroids because much less medicine is given. The amount of medicine given in a systemic corticosteroid can be 10 to 100 times more. Systemic Corticosteroids May be given for a short period if your child has a bad asthma attack. In some cases, these medicines can save lives.\t Form . Your child may take a pill, tablet, or liquid. Medicine may also be given by a shot or through the vein (IV).\t Side effects  can include behavior change, increased appetite, acne, thrush (a yeast infection in the mouth), stomach upset, or trouble sleeping. These all go away when the medicine is stopped. More serious side effects can happen if this medicine is used often or for 2 weeks or longer. They include cataracts (clouding of the lens of the eye), weight gain, worsening of diabetes, bone thinning, slowing of growth, reduced ability to fight off infections, stomach ulcers, and high blood pressure. Inhaled Corticosteroids May be given to prevent or control asthma symptoms. Inflammation inside the bronchial tubes of the lungs is felt to be an important cause of asthma.      Inhaled corticosteroids  work by decreasing this inflammation. Inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective long-term medicine for the control and prevention of asthma. They can reduce asthma symptoms, and your child may not need to take as many other medicines. Inhaled corticosteroids also can improve sleep and activity and prevent asthma attacks.\t Form . Medicine is breathed in through an inhaler.\t Side effects  are much less common and less serious than those that occur from long-term systemic use. They may include a yeast infection in the mouth or hoarseness. The risk can be reduced using a         spacer  or holding chamber, rinsing the mouth after use, or using the lowest dose needed. Intranasal Corticosteroids May be given to prevent or control a runny nose and congestion from allergies. Intranasal corticosteroids work very well in treating allergy symptoms, and your child may not need to take as many other allergy medicines.\t Form . Medicine is sprayed into the nose.\t Side effects  may include irritation of the nose, or feeling that something is \"running down the throat\" at the time the nose spray is used. Occasionally, a child can have nosebleeds from using the spray. If this occurs, stopping the nose spray for a few days often allows the child to be able to restart the medicine and continue using it. Your Child's Growth Recent studies have shown that inhaled corticosteroids for asthma may slow down growth in some children during the first year of treatment, but this is only temporary. These children ended up with their normal expected heights as adults. To reduce the risk of any side effects, your pediatrician will prescribe the lowest dose needed to control the symptoms. Your child's height will also be measured regularly during office visits.",

        "content": "​ By: Michael Pistiner, MD, MMSc, FAAP Severe allergic reactions are unpredictable—they can happen anywhere, anytime. Symptoms can even go away with treatment and come back later. Parents of children with severe allergies to certain      foods ,      insect stings , latex, and medication know this all too well.  What's the Plan? In an effort to appropriately treat      anaphylaxis —a potentially life-threating, severe allergic reaction—the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) developed the clinical report , \t   Guidance on Completing a Written Allergy and Anaphylaxis Emergency Plan . The report explains to pediatricians and other health care providers how to create and use the new AAP Allergy and Anaphylaxis Emergency Plan. This new emergency care plan (ECP) is based on the most up to date and appropriate treatment of anaphylaxis. It's also clearly written and easy to understand. See for yourself!  ​Be Better Prepared for an Allergic Emergency\t In situations when you are not with your child, these written plans will also arm nurses, teachers, coaches, parents, relatives, babysitters, etc. with the tools they need in the event of an emergency.\t Download the AAP Allergy and Anaphylaxis Emergency Plan (PDF)   The AAP plan emphasizes the important role of epinephrine and de-emphasizes the role of antihistamines (e.g., Benadryl). It lists symptoms and clearly tells the caregiver or child when to use the      epinephrine auto-injector . Allergy and anaphylaxis emergency plans are especially important to provide to schools and child care facilities. Anaphylaxis emergency care plan overview:    Includes simple criteria to identify potential allergic emergencies for use by patients, families, school staff, and all caregivers Is accessible and understandable to anyone caring for your child Given to school, child care, after-school programs, or any place where others care for your child Trains others using your child's specific ECP When creating an ECP, it is also important to customize it to the specific needs of your child, allergies, family, and your state and local regulations. (Some may have their own forms already in place; you can encourage them to use this new one.) If in Doubt, Give Epinephrine! The AAP report also includes more evidence for why epinephrine is so important and safe and that delaying the use of epinephrine and relying on antihistamines is a bad idea! Epinephrine is the first line treatment for anaphylaxis because it works quickly by delivering a dose of medicine directly into a child's muscle. The auto-injectors are specially designed for easy use in non-medical settings. Delays in giving epinephrine for anaphylaxis can increase the risk of death, long hospitalization, and a second anaphylactic reaction called a      biphasic reaction . Anyone caring for a child with an allergy that can be life-threatening must know how to recognize anaphylaxis and know when and how to give the lifesaving treatment for severe allergic reactions. The  AAP Allergy and Anaphylaxis Emergency Plan  and clinical report were designed to help with this—wherever your child is and whoever is caring for him or her. ​Things to know about epinephrine:\t First-line treatment of choice Acts where it is needed Will make you feel better Fast acting Delays in administration increase risk of death Err on the side of caution and give if any doubt Safe medicine\t \t  Additional Information:\t Peanut Allergies: What You Should Know About the Latest Research \t How to Use an Epinephrine Auto-Injector\t 10 Things for Parents to Know Before Heading to the ER\t Management of Food Allergy in the School Setting  (AAP Clinical Report) About Dr. Pistiner:\t Michael Pistiner, MD, MMSc, FAAP is a Boston based pediatric allergist for Atrius Health.

        "content": "Diagnosis follows an orderly process that starts with a careful medical history. Your pediatrician or  allergy specialist  will ask a lot of questions about your child’s symptoms and medical background, and about your family’s medical history as well. Does your child cough, wheeze, or get extra short of breath when she’s running or playing hard? Does your child cough a lot? Is the coughing worse at night? Is she wheezing? Does she have trouble breathing? Does her chest feel tight sometimes? What happens when she laughs or becomes upset? Does your child sneeze frequently? Does she rub her nose often? Does she blow her nose or wipe it a lot? Is the nasal discharge clear and runny? (A clear discharge is typical of allergic rhinitis, also called hay fever, the most common form of allergy) Or is it thick and greenish or yellowish? (A yellow or green color suggests that your child may have an infection, separate or possibly in addition to allergy symptoms.) Are her eyes itchy and watery? Does she have more than her share of colds? Do they last longer than a week? Does she ever have a rash or itchy bumps on the skin? How often does she have symptoms? How long do they last? Do particular events or exposures seem to bring on symptoms, or make them better or worse? Have the symptoms ever gotten better after your child has taken medicine? What kind of medication helped? Your pediatrician will ask whether your child’s symptoms often appear during a particular season of the year, at a certain location, or when your child is around animals, such as cats. Your pediatrician will also ask whether symptoms come on after your child has eaten a particular food. Your pediatrician will ask whether other members of the family have hay fever, asthma, or eczema because  allergy and asthma  run in families. However, even if you can’t recall a single relative who sneezes and wheezes, your doctor will not discount allergy and asthma in your child because, like many disorders, they can appear with no prior family history. Parents sometimes try over-the-counter medications before asking their pediatricians about a persistent cough, a rash, or respiratory symptoms. Although it’s recommended that you talk with your pediatrician before giving medications to your child, it’s helpful to tell the doctor whether a medication had any effect because this can give clues about the possible cause of symptoms. For example, if a runny nose and itchiness bothered your child less and she stopped sneezing for a while after taking an antihistamine, chances are she has an allergy and not an infection. Conversely, if her coughing and wheezing did not change after she took a dose of an over-the-counter medication, your pediatrician may decide to test or even go ahead and treat for asthma before looking for other underlying conditions.\t Symptoms: All in the Timing Allergy symptoms that come and go with the seasons may be caused by seasonal plants such as trees, grasses, and weeds. Coughing, sneezing, or other chest and nose symptoms that get much better when your child is away from home may indicate that your child is sensitive to substances normally found indoors, such as pets. By contrast, symptoms that always clear up on weekends and school vacations suggest that there may be a problem with something in the environment at school. Coughing at night with hoarseness and frequent throat clearing may be caused by postnasal drip from allergic rhinitis or sinusitis. But coughing, wheezing, and related symptoms that get worse at night may also raise suspicions about asthma because asthma symptoms are often worse at night. Your pediatrician may suspect exercise-induced asthma if your child frequently coughs or wheezes when running or playing energetically. Allergies Tend to Run in Families Many types of allergy problems, including hay fever, asthma, and eczema, tend to run in families. If both parents have allergies, each child has about a 60% to 70% chance of being allergic. However, allergic responses to  insect venom,  medications, and latex are the exceptions to the rule. Having a parent with one of these allergies does not increase the chance a child will be allergic.",

        "content": "One of the difficulties of diagnosing asthma in babies and toddlers is that it’s not very easy to measure lung function in small children. So in trying to make a diagnosis, your pediatrician will rely heavily on your child’s symptoms and other information.  Wheezing, Coughing, or Fast Breathing  Your pediatrician will ask whether your baby tends to wheeze, cough, or breathe fast when he has a “ cold ,” is near animals, or is in a place that’s dusty or tainted by smoke. Make sure you tell your pediatrician about any excessive coughing that your child has, particularly nighttime cough and prolonged cough after a “cold,” even if there is no wheezing, because asthma can be present with coughing being the only symptom.  Your Family's Medical History  Your pediatrician will also ask whether you or other family members have asthma, hay fever, or eczema, or if there’s anyone in the family with recurrent bronchitis or sinus problems. ​When Asthma is Not the Cause\t   Your pediatrician will listen carefully to make sure that the sounds your baby is making are coming from the airways of the lungs, and not from the baby's voice box higher up in the throat or the nose. Sometimes babies breathe noisily as a result of laryngotracheomalacia , a temporary weakness in the cartilage near the vocal cords. They grow out of this as the tissues become firmer.\t If your baby starts wheezing after breathing in a foreign object (eg, a bit of food, a small toy) that has become lodged in a bronchial tube, he needs urgentmedical attention. Unusual conditions related to airway development or prematurity can also cause wheezing in infants. In general, an unexplained frequent cough or daily cough in infants may mean serious disease and should be evaluated by your pediatrician or pediatric pulmonologist.   Growth & Development  Your pediatrician will check to make sure your baby is maintaining a satisfactory rate of growth and development. Most infants with asthma make good progress and are otherwise healthy. If your pediatrician is concerned that your baby may be growing too slowly or failing to thrive, tests for conditions other than asthma will be ordered. Certain tests, including a sweat test to rule out      cystic fibrosis , may be necessary when your doctor wants to be sure your baby’s wheezing and chest symptoms are not caused by a condition with symptoms that are similar to asthma. Chest Radiographs Chest radiographs may be ordered during your baby’s first wheezing bout to make sure that there isn’t a problem in the lungs. If asthma is diagnosed, repeated radiographs are rarely needed because the problem is in the bronchial tubes, which cannot be seen very well in radiographs.  ​Allergy Testing\t Your pediatrician is not likely to recommend allergy testing right away for your baby unless you suspect that wheezing always occurs after your child has been around a certain item, like an animal, or consumed a certain food. However, keep in mind that food allergy is rarely a cause of asthma in infants and toddlers, although it may be a trigger for eczema.\t Asthma Medications & Treatment  Sometimes the easiest and best way to diagnose asthma in a young child is to treat with asthma therapy and see if the child improves. This is because for the most part, medications  for asthma only help asthma and not other conditions. If improvement is seen, asthma is the likely diagnosis. If this approach is taken with your child, help your pediatrician by monitoring your child’s symptoms carefully so you can give good feedback as to whether the medications have helped.",

        "content": "​By: Harvey Leo, MD, FAAP, FAAAAI Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease in children. It affects more than 6 million U.S. children and leads to over 13 million missed days of school each year. Yet as common as it is, asthma can be challenging to diagnose in children. There is no one-size-fits-all set of symptoms. A solid, ongoing relationship with your child's health provider can help identify asthma risks and the best treatment for your child. ​ Questions to ask Pediatricians have many tools to help identify and support a child who might have asthma. The most important tool of all is the child's medical history. Depending on their age, some children will not have wheezing during an asthma flare, but rather a chronic cough that lasts for days or appears during illness or activity. Here are some key questions your child's doctor will need to know: How often does your child cough or wheeze during the week? Do these symptoms affect their daily activity? Does your child's coughing or wheezing wake them up at night? What medicines have your tried and have they helped, including nutritional supplements or homeopathic therapies? Does anyone in the family have a history of asthma, environmental allergies, or other respiratory conditions?​\t   Asthma tests If a child is old enough, usually over age 7 years, your health care provider may request an asthma test. One of the most common ones uses spiromety to check lung function. For this test, the child breathes into a device that will show whether your child has some airway blockage.      Another test developed over the past decade checks how much nitric oxide your child exhales. This measures how much inflammation there is in the airway. Pediatric specialty centers may also offer more complex lung function testing, imaging tests and techniques such as methacholine provocative challenges, which gauges how \"reactive\" a child's lungs are. These tests may be used for the diagnosis and follow-up management of asthma. Additional resources such as home respiratory monitors and medication reminder phone apps can also be help manage a child's asthma.​ Conditions that can look like ​asthma Keep in mind, there are many other conditions that can look like or worsen asthma in children. Some of these include seasonal allergies, acid      reflux , viral or bacterial infections, conditions related to a child's anatomy, and cardiovascular issues. ​ Remember There are many tools that can help diagnose asthma, and treatment and medi​ca​tions that can help a child with asthma thrive. If you think your child may have asthma, talk with your pediatrician. ​ More information​\t What Is An Asthma Action Plan?\t 9 Asthma Triggers​ and What to Do About Them\t Allergies & Asthma\t National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Asthma ​​​About Dr. Leo\t  Harvey Leo, MD, FAAP, FAAAAI, who practices in Michigan, is a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Allergy and Immunology.  ​",

        "content": "When you know that dust mites are among the causes of your child’s allergic symptoms, you may want to reach for the vacuum cleaner every time you spy a trace of dust on the furniture. But vacuuming may not be the solution. Use of a normally efficient vacuum cleaner stirs up clouds of fine dust that can hang about in the air for up to 8 hours and make sneezing, runny nose, and itchiness worse. It’s best to wait until your allergic child is out of the house—at school for the day, for example—before vacuuming. Or to avoid stirring up dust, invest in a vacuum cleaner with a      high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter . Dust Mites to Dust: Dust mites are the main source of allergens in house dust. It’s difficult for many people who are allergic to accept that these creatures, invisible except under a microscope, can be present in large numbers even in a thoroughly cleaned home. Some are convinced only when symptoms improve as a result of mite-containment measures. Dust mites are members of the same family as spiders. Too small to be seen with the naked eye, they find a home wherever humans live. Dust mites don’t ask for much in life. They feed on any protein that comes their way and find easy pickings in the dead skin scales that humans shed every day. Apart from this simple diet, they need only a moderately warm, moist atmosphere, with a temperature of 65°F or higher and humidity around 65%. Bedding is the ideal dust mite home; after all, bedding offers warmth, sufficient moisture, plenty of skin, and fibrous materials to which dust mites can cling with their barbed legs. They also thrive in upholstered furniture, clothing, soft toys, and carpets. The dust mite eats and excretes pellets of feces that are about the size of pollen grains, and finds other dust mites, with which it produces many offspring. Their fecal pellets enter the general household dust to become the main source of allergens. Eventually, as mites die off, their dried-out carcasses, composed of allergenic proteins, also join the dust. Over years, they can add many pounds to the weight of a mattress. ​              To keep household dust levels down:\t \t  Clean all non-carpeted floors at least once a week with a damp mop.\t Use a damp cloth to wipe flat surfaces, louver blinds, window ledges, and picture frames.\t Air-conditioning and keeping doors and windows closed are effective ways to keep your home free of allergens and irritants brought in by air from the outside.  While it may be too costly to install air-conditioning throughout your home, you may find an economical way to install a unit in your allergic child’s bedroom. This could help your child sleep better at night and provide a low-allergen retreat on days when the pollen count is high. Air-conditioner filters should be checked and cleaned regularly, and sprayed with an anti-mildew aerosol to control the growth of molds.\t   Families may find their allergic members have fewer symptoms when room air is filtered through a HEPA air c leaner. However, air filtration should complement, not replace, measures to control mites. In fact, air cleaners do not significantly reduce mite exposure and should not be recommended for dust mite control. A HEPA air cleaner can be installed centrally in a forced-air ventilation system, or used as a portable room unit and left on at night in your child’s bedroom (see below). When you run a room HEPA cleaning unit, make sure the windows of the room are shut and the bedroom door is closed.   Keep Humidity Low to Discourage Mites: Dust mites flourish when the humidity is around 75% to 80%. These tiny cousins of spiders need water to survive but have no means of conserving it in their tissues. When the surrounding humidity falls below 50%, mites soon shrivel up and die. Thus, reducing household humidity can drastically reduce the dust mite population. A  dehumidifier  is useful for drying out the air. Take care to empty the water pan daily and scour it to stop the growth of microscopic molds. Humidifier Use Can Promote Growth of Mites and Molds: Any increase in humidity, such as when a  humidifier  is used, will encourage mites and molds to grow in your child’s room. If your child has problems with croup or other breathing difficulties, ask your pediatrician’s advice about the best way to ensure that the air in the bedroom is moist enough to breathe comfortably but dry enough to discourage mites and molds.

        "content": "​​Almost every child and adult with asthma can benefit from    sports  and    physical activity . Also, asthma should not prevent young athletes from enjoying a full athletic career. Read on to learn more about asthma and how to prevent it from causing problems for your child during exercise.  What is asthma?\t Asthma  is the most common chronic medical problem in children. Children with asthma can have different symptoms at different times. The most common problems are cough,  wheeze​  difficulty breathing, chest “tightness,\" and  chest pain . Almost all children with asthma will have one or more of these symptoms when they have a  cold ​ or with exercise.  Many symptoms are brought on with allergies or exposure to  cigarette smoke , laughing, or crying. Most children with asthma have symptoms while they exercise or right after they exercise. Children with asthma symptoms only with exercise may have exercise-induced asthma. ​ ​What causes asthma?\t   The cause of asthma is unknown. Genetics may play a role—children are more likely to have asthma if other people in the family have asthma. However, many children with no family history of the disease have asthma. Asthma is also more common in children with allergies. However, some children with allergies do not have asthma and some children with asthma do not have allergies. Exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke ​or pollutants makes children more likely to develop asthma.    How does exercise cause asthma symptoms? The symptoms of asthma are caused by narrowing of the small bronchial tubes in the lung. The narrowing is caused by inflammation and swelling within these tubes and by spasm of the muscles in the bronchial walls. It is unknown why exercise causes airways to narrow. In general, exercise-induced asthma is most likely to occur with endurance exercise in cool, dry air. However, there are exceptions, including exercising in warm, humid air with a lot of pollutants or swimming in a poorly ventilated space with strong chlorine fumes.  How can you prevent exercise-induced asthma? The first thing to do to prevent asthma symptoms with exercise is to make sure that the asthma unrelated to exercise is well controlled. For many children this means the regular use of    inhaled steroid medicines  and use of medicines before exercise. Ask your child's doctor about what medicine is best for your child and make sure your child learns the proper technique for using an inhaler. If the asthma is well controlled but your child still has problems during or after exercise, let your child's doctor know.  Here are some other ways to help prevent exercise-induced asthma:  When exercising in the cold, wrap a scarf or mask around the face to warm up and humidify the air. Avoid exercise in the early morning or try exercising inside. Increase fitness level (exercise-induced asthma symptoms improve as fitness improves). Try a different sport or cross-training. ​Do a short warm-up exercise before the main exercise session.\t Warning:  If a child still has symptoms even with treatment, exercise should be stopped. Asthma can be life-threatening if the athlete tries to play through the symptoms. Once the symptoms are controlled, the child can return to exercise.   What problems can “look like\" asthma? Probably the most common situation that is mistaken for exercise-induced asthma is that a child is not in very good athletic shape. It is normal for all of us to breathe harder when we exercise, and this is especially true for someone who isn't very active. Sometimes this normal heavy breathing can be mistaken for asthma. The good news is that it's easy to “cure\" this problem by doing more exercise!  In athletes, another problem called  vocal cord dysfunction  (VCD) can occur, and seems a lot like exercise-induced asthma. The vocal cords are located in the throat, at the opening to our trachea (windpipe), not in our lungs. They help us form words by opening and closing to let different amounts of air out of the lungs. In VCD, the vocal cords close when they are supposed to open, making it harder to breathe in air. Signs of VCD include a high-pitched noise while breathing in, breathing too fast, and a “tight\" feeling in the throat. It can be very difficult to distinguish VCD from asthma and may require referral to an asthma specialist or    ear, nose, and throat specialist​ .​ ​More Information​ ​Allergies & Asthma​​ ​",

        "content": "Pollens and Outdoor Molds As with other types of allergies, the ideal way to manage hay fever is to find out what your child is allergic to and then avoid it. It sounds simple, but this is much easier said than done.  To start with, many children are allergic to     pollens and molds, both of which are found everywhere outdoors and cannot be completely avoided. Children need to go outside to play, so pollen exposure when outdoors is unavoidable.  What Parents Can Do: ​Exposure to outdoor pollen and mold that enters the house can be decreased by closing windows and using air conditioning, showering and changing clothes as soon as children come inside at the end of the day, and by making sure bedding is dried in a dryer, not outside on a clothes line.  Dust Mites and Indoor Molds In addition to outdoor allergens, a child may be allergic to routinely encountered indoor substances such as dust mites or indoor molds. These everyday allergens can be kept at low levels when certain changes are made. Still, they are almost impossible to eliminate altogether, no matter how carefully you clean your home. Your child is also bound to run into indoor allergens and irritants when he ventures away from home and into other environments, such as school or friends’ homes. Dust had a reputation for causing sneezing and irritation long before allergies were called allergies. Not only does it irritate the nose, throat, and eyes, but it can also contain allergenic materials. A major cause of allergic symptoms lies beyond the dust itself. It has been traced to     \t   dust mites —tiny creatures that, like Dr Seuss’ Whos down in Whoville, make their homes among dust specks. But whereas the Whos asked only to be left in peace, there’s no getting away from dust mites. They live wherever humans live; in fact, they clean up after us. They can live on any organic debris, but their preferred diet is the half gram or so of worn-out skin cells that every human sheds daily. They a​lso thrive on tiny fungi—like the mites, too small to be seen with the naked eye—that flourish where the relative humidity is fairly high, at 70% or more. Spores from these fungi are a major cause of allergic symptoms in humans. Dust mites congregate where food is plentiful. They are especially numerous in beds, pillows, upholstered furniture, and rugs. Although vacuuming and dusting can help decrease dust levels inside the home, these measures don’t work very well against dust mites. As gross as it is, your child is actually allergic to a protein in dust mite feces. So steps are taken to kill dust mites and to use a containment approach to avoid mites’ feces. Padded furnishings such as mattresses, box springs, pillows, and cushions should be encased in allergen-proof, zip-up covers, which are available through catalogs and specialized retailers. Covers made of nonwoven synthetic fabrics are more comfortable than plastic covers and work at least as well. The microscopic dust mite fecal particles are too large to pass thorough allergy-proof covers. What Parents Can Do:  Choose blankets and pillows made of synthetic materials. Because dust mites can survive in warm soapy water, wash linens weekly and other bedding, such as blankets, every 2 to 3 weeks in hot water, then put them through the hottest cycle of a clothes dryer. Pillows should be replaced every 2 or 3 years. Dust mites also abound in cuddly stuffed toys. When possible, replace soft, plush-covered toys with others that have smooth plastic bodies and washable clothes. If your child has a favorite soft toy from which she can’t be parted, wash it every other day or so in hot water and dry it at the highest setting. Or seal soft toys in plastic bags and put them in the freezer for at least 5 hours or overnight once a week. Dust mites cannot survive longer than 5 hours at freezing temperature; you can then rinse the toys in warm water and put them in the dryer to get rid of the dead mites. These steps will not necessarily remove all of the allergenic dust mite feces, but they help! Keep bulky fabrics and dust-catching clutter out of your child’s room. Remove wall-to-wall carpeting, if possible. Floors should be wooden, tile, or vinyl—anything but carpet. Damp mopping and electrostatic floor mops are helpful for clean up. If you prefer rugs for comfort, use small cotton or synthetic throw rugs that can be washed weekly in hot water. Curtains should be easily washable. When it comes to the walls, the aim is to eliminate horizontal surfaces that trap dust. There should be no picture frames or shelves displaying books or ornaments, and all surfaces—on dressers, bedside tables, and other furniture—should be easy to wipe clean. Avoid humidifiers and vaporizers. Dust mites need humidity to live, and humidification will only further help the mite population grow. For the same reason, using a dehumidifier in certain moist geographical locations can be beneficial by helping to keep the humidity below the range that suits mites and molds. However, if you use a dehumidifier, it’s essential not only to empty the water pan but also to scour it daily to prevent the growth of invisiblesome airborne allergens but are not generally useful for dust mites. No matter how careful you may be, you can’t protect a child as if she were a hothouse plant. And even if you were to succeed in eliminating most environmental allergens in your home, children still get exposed at school and at playmates’ homes. Furthermore, it’s hard to avoid the normally harmless kinds of nonallergenic irritants that can set off symptoms in a nose already primed and twitchy from allergen exposure.

The tip-offs for hay fever are A clear, watery nasal discharge Itching of the eyes, ears, nose, or mouth Spasmodic sneezing\t   Fever  is never from an allergy; it almost always suggests an infection. Antibiotics will not help allergies or a common cold from a virus. Colds or allergies can sometimes lead to ear or sinus infections; when this happens, antibiotics can be helpful. With a cold, nasal secretions are often thicker than in allergy and can be discolored (as compared with the clear, watery discharge of allergies). The child who has a cold may have a sore throat and a cough, and the child’s temperature is sometimes slightly raised but not always. Itchiness is not usually a complaint with a cold, but it is the hallmark of an allergy problem.

        "content": "Devices to Help Deliver Asthma Medications\t Me dications for asthma can be given to your child using a variety of devices including the following:\t Nebulizer —This is often used with younger children. This device uses an air compressor and cup to change liquid medication into a mist that can be inhaled through a mouthpiece or mask. Inhaled steroids and quick-relief medications can be given this way. \t Metered-dose inhaler (MDI)— This is the most commonly used device for asthma medications. However, your child will need to learn how to use it properly, which means pressing (or actuating) the device while taking a deep breath at the same time. The technique is reviewed on the following pages. Some MDIs are “breath actuated,” that is, they give out a puff of medication when you start to take a breath. These types of MDIs are much easier to use, but are only available for one type of quick-relief medication. Spacers can be used to help relieve some of the coordination problems in using MDIs and should always be used when using inhaled steroids. \t Dry powder inhaler (DPI)— This device is available for some medications. It is easier to use because you do not need to coordinate breathing with actuation. It also has less taste, and often has a built-in counter to help keep track of doses taken and doses left.\t Some asthma medications only come in pill form. However, inhaling the medication using one of the devices listed above is usually better because the medication passes straight into the airways. As a result, side effects are reduced or avoided altogether. Because there are several different inhalers on the market, your health care provider will suggest the one that is best for your child. There are important differences in the way they are used and in the amounts of medications they deliver to the airways. Your child will be taught how to use the inhaler, but her technique should be checked regularly to make sure she is getting the right dose of medication. \t Peak Flow Meter\t To help control asthma, your child may need to use a peak flow meter. This is a handheld device that measures how fast a person can blow air out of the lungs. Asthma treatment plans using peak flow meters use 3 zones—green, yellow, and red, like traffic lights—to help you determine if your child’s asthma is getting better or worse. Peak flow rates decrease (the numbers on the scale go down) when your child’s asthma is getting worse or is out of control. Peak flow rates increase (the numbers on the scale go up) when the asthma treatment is working and the airways are opening up. \t When to Use the Peak Flow Meter\t Check your child’s asthma using the peak flow meter at the following times:\t Every morning, before he takes any medications. \t If your child’s symptoms worsen or if he has an asthma attack. Check the peak flow rate before and after using medications for the attack. This will help you to see if the medications are working. \t Other times during the day, if your health care provider suggests.\t Keep in mind, there are differences in peak flow rate measurements at different times of the day. These differences are minimal when asthma is well controlled. Increasing differences may be an early sign of worsening asthma. Also, children of different sizes and ages have different peak flow rate measurements.\t Keep a record of your child’s peak flow numbers each day. This will help you and your health care provider see how your child’s asthma is doing. Bring this record with you when you visit the pediatrician.",

        "content": "​​If your child has asthma, the goal of treatment is to minimize symptoms so they can participate in normal physical activities. It is also important to prevent emergency department visits and hospitalizations from asthma attacks.  Ideally, when asthma is well controlled, your child should not experience asthma symptoms more than once or twice per week. Also, asthma symptoms should not wake them at night more than twice per month. And, most importantly, your child should be able to participate in all play, sports, and physical education activities. Different forms of asthma medicine  Asthma medications come in a variety of forms, including: Metered-dose inhalers Dry powder inhalers Liquids that can be used in nebulizers Pills Injections Note:  Inhaled forms are preferred because they deliver the medication directly to your child's air passages with minimal side effects. Which asthma medicine does my child need? Asthma is different in every person, and symptoms can change over time. Your child's doctor will determine which asthma medication is best based on how severe and how often your child has symptoms, as well as your child's age. If your child has asthma symptoms that occur only occasionally, they'll be given medications for short periods. If their symptoms occur more often, your child may need a controller medication. Sometimes, it's necessary to take several medications at the same time to control and prevent symptoms. Your child's doctor may give them several medications at first to get their asthma symptoms under control, and then decrease the medications as needed. The doctor may also recommend a  peak flow meter  for your child to use at home to monitor lung function. This can help you make decisions about changing therapy and track how changes made by your doctor affect your child. Asthma medications are divided into two groups: Quick-relief medications and controller medications. Quick-relief medications Quick-relief medications are taken for short-term relief, usually either with an inhaler or a nebulizer. They work rapidly to open up narrowed airways and help relieve the feeling of tightness in the chest, wheezing, and breathlessness. They can also be used to prevent  exercise-induced asthma . The most commonly used quick-relief medication is albuterol. These medications are taken only when your child needs them. They should be used for any asthma symptom, including wheezing, chest tightness, and cough, rather than just asthma attacks. Your child should have quick-relief medication available at home, school, and anywhere they are participating in sports.  For serious asthma attacks, your child may be given corticosteroids by mouth or injection to reduce inflammation inside the airways and speed recovery. Controller medications Controller medications are used on a daily basis to control asthma and reduce the number of days or nights that your child has symptoms. These medications are not used for relief of symptoms. Children who have symptoms more than twice per week or who wake up more than twice per month should be on controller medications. How many  asthma attacks  your child has and how severe they are also determine whether they need a controller medication. Examples of controller medications include: Inhaled  corticosteroids   work by treating the inflammation in your child's lungs, which helps reduce asthma attacks. When used in the recommended dose, inhaled steroids are safe for most children. However, your child's doctor may recommend another type of controller medication instead based on your child's specific needs. Combination  i nhalers  contain both corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators, also known as long-acting beta agonists (LABA). LABAs are similar to albuterol in that they work quickly to open up the airway, but they last much longer. Your doctor may prescribe a combination inhaler when inhaled steroids alone aren't keeping your child's asthma controlled. Theophylline.  Usually taken by mouth as a timed-release pill, theophylline opens up the airways for an extended period. It can be used alone or together with inhaled corticosteroids. If your child has nighttime symptoms, theophylline can be particularly helpful in preventing these. Although it was once used extensively, theophylline isn't often prescribed for asthma anymore. This is mainly because it requires careful monitoring of blood levels to avoid side effects and because other asthma medications often work as well or better. Leukotriene receptor antagonists.  Also known as leukotriene modifiers, leukotriene receptor antagonists work by decreasing the effects of an inflammatory chemical made by the body called leukotrienes. The two leukotriene modifiers currently in use, montelukast and zafirlukast, are very safe. They come in tablet form and for young children, chewable tablets or granules are available. Biologic injections.  If your child has severe asthma and other medications aren't keeping it under control, your doctor may recommend adding a newer medication called a biologic. Biologic injections such as omalizumab and mepolizumab are given every 2 to 4 weeks to kids who are 6 years and older. New asthma management guidelines: get SMART For kids 4 years and older who have moderate to severe persistent asthma, updated guidelines now recommend using single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART). With SMART, instead of using an inhaled steroid every day along with a quick-relief medication as needed, your child can use just one combination inhaler.  This inhaler contains both a corticosteroid and a specific LABA called formoterol. The formoterol relieves your child's symptoms quickly while the corticosteroid helps keep their asthma under control. Your child can use the same inhaler once or twice a day as directed by their doctor, as well as when they need quick relief for asthma symptoms. The advantages of SMART include only needing one inhaler and decreased exposure to corticosteroids. Ask your doctor if SMART is a good option for your child. Asthma action plan Everyone with asthma should have a written  asthma action plan . The plan shows your child's treatment information, such as what kind of medicines they take and when they take them. It also describes how to control asthma long term and how to handle an asthma attack. Additionally, the plan explains when to call your child's doctor or go to the emergency room. All of the people who care for your child should have a copy of their asthma action plan. This includes family members, child care providers,  schools , camps, team coaches, and instructors. In an emergency, these people can help your child follow their asthma action plan. The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) provides easy-to-use examples and forms for setting up your child's asthma action plan.

        "content": "​​​After confirming an asthma diagnosis, your pediatrician will grade the severity of your child’s condition. This grading takes into account the frequency and severity of past and current asthma symptoms and the physical examination, and may include measures of lung function including spirometry or peak flow measurements. This information enables your pediatrician to select the right medication and determine the proper dose to keep the condition in check. (See \"What Really Matters Is Control, Not Severity\" below.) In making a decision about a child’s asthma severity level, the first distinction to be made is whether your child has    intermittent  asthma (ie, just occasional problems) or    persistent  asthma (ie, more than occasional). Patients with persistent asthma can have mild, moderate, or severe asthma. Following are more details about the 4 asthma severity levels that arise by making this kind of distinction. What Really Matters Is Control, Not Severity It turns out that asthma severity categories are somewhat arbitrary and, in fact, were actually created more with adults in mind than children. They are just a general guide for the doctor seeing your child; your doctor realizes that asthma severity levels, particularly in children, can change over time, so reassessments need to take place on an ongoing basis to verify an individual child’s present asthma severity. Furthermore, the 2007 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute \"National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma\" make a strong point that the overall    control  of your child’s asthma is really what is most important, not what the severity level happens to be at any time. Adjustments of treatment are based mainly on how well-controlled your child’s asthma is when assessed at follow-up visits. Intermittent Asthma A child who has symptoms of wheezing and coughing no more than 2 days a week is con-sidered to have intermittent asthma; nighttime flare-ups occur twice a month at most. Outside of these few episodes, a child with intermittent asthma is free of asthma symptoms. Any child with asthma symptoms more often than 2 days a week or 2 nights per month, on average, is felt to no longer have intermittent asthma but    persistent  asthma. Persistent asthma has 3 levels of severity. Mild Persistent Asthma In    mild persistent  asthma, symptoms occur more than twice a week but less than once a day, and flare-ups may affect activity. Nighttime flare-ups occur more often than twice a month but less than once a week. Lung function is 80% of normal or greater. Moderate Persistent Asthma Asthma is classified as    moderate persistent  if symptoms occur daily. Flare-ups occur and usually last several days. Coughing and wheezing may disrupt the child’s normal activities and make it difficult to sleep. Nighttime flare-ups may occur more than once a week. In moderate persistent asthma, lung function is roughly between 60% and 80% of normal, without treatment. Severe Persistent Asthma With    severe persistent  asthma, symptoms occur daily and often. They also frequently curtail the child’s activities or disrupt his sleep. Lung function is less than 60% of the normal level without treatment. Severe is the least-common asthma level.",

        "content": "​​​​​​​​​For children allergic to nickel, anything from jeans with metal buttons to handheld electronics can cause a red, itchy rash. Called nickel-allergic contact dermatitis, an    allergy  to nickel affects an estimated 1.1 million children in the United States.      An allergy to nickel is not life-threatening, but it can be uncomfortable enough to get in the way of a child's    s leep  and cause them to    miss school . Sometimes, an allergic reaction to nickel is mistaken for an infection, especially near broken skin like a  pierced  ear. The allergy also has been linked to severe hand    eczema  later in adulthood. What does an allergic reaction to nickel l​ook like? The skin allergic  reaction  to nickel looks like eczema. Signs and symptoms include an itchy rash with redness, swelling, scaling and possibly a crusty appearance. The rash generally appears on the area of the skin that comes into contact with the metal. If the metal exposure is ongoing, sometimes a rash may show up in more distant parts of the body. Once children become sensitive to nickel, gradually worsening rashes may develop each time they are exposed to nickel again.   How to help prevent nickel allergy reactions Although there is no cure for nickel allergy, here are a few ways to help prevent reactions: Clothing & accessories.  Avoid clothing with metal buttons, snaps, rivets and zippers. Look for belts, watches and jewelry and other accessories that are labeled \"nickel-free,\" or buy items that are hypoallergenic are or made of surgical-grade stainless steel, gold, silver, or platinum.​ Cover or coat surfaces.  Sew a piece of cloth over the metal to prevent direct contact with skin. It may also help to put two coats of clear nail polish on metal that touches skin. This is not an ideal solution, since nail polish can chip off and needs to be touched up--especially after washings. Electronic devices.  Place a nickel-free case around your child's tablet or phone that covers the parts made of metal. Coins & keys.  Advise your child not to keep loose coins and keys in pockets. Seating.  Avoid sitting on metal chairs or plastic chairs with metal tabs while wearing shorts. Ear piercing & braces.  Avoid ear piercing, at least until after a child is past the age when they might get braces. This helps prevent sensitization to nickel that can get worse while wearing metal braces. If your child does get pierced ears, choose posts that are nickel-free or made of surgical grade steel that is less likely to release nickel. It is also a good idea to wear plastic posts until the skin heals from piercing. Cosmetics.  Cosmetics and other beauty products that contain metal should be avoided. Nickel allergy has been linked with nail polish from a bottle that contains nickel metal shaker balls. Foods & cooking.  Particularly if a child has a known nickel allergy, it might be useful to avoid foods that contain nickel. This includes chocolate, nuts, soy products, black tea, seeds, and commercial salad dressings. Choose fresh or frozen rather than canned food when possible. Don't use stainless steel pots and pans to cook acidic foods that contain acidic ingredients like tomato, vinegar, or lemon. Tap water.  Run  tap water  for a few seconds before washing, drinking, and cooking to help flush out any nickel that can leach from pipes and fixtures. Tattoo ink.  ​Teens and young adults who are allergic to nickel should use extra caution if they are considering getting      tattoos , since some inks contain nickel. Treatment for nickel allergy In addition to recommending ways to help avoid exposure to nickel, your pediatrician may recommend short-term treatment with a steroid ointment or another anti-inflammatory medication.

        "content": "A      peak flow meter  (or, rarely, a small electronic portable spirometer) is sometimes recommended as part of a treatment plan. These handheld devices measure how fast a person can blow air out of the lungs. Asthma causes patients to not be able to blow air out fast because their airways are narrowed, so a low measurement with this device suggests problems are occurring with your child's asthma. These measurements can help warn a patient or parent that extra medication is needed to fend off more severe asthma symptoms. The results can also be useful for the patient who does not adequately perceive worsening airway obstruction or who has difficulty distinguishing anxiety or hyperventilation attacks from asthma. When your child is having asthma problems, a peak flow reading puts a number on how she is doing, much as a thermometer shows how high a temperature is. Your pediatrician or asthma specialist will show you how to record your child's baseline measurements at a time when she is doing well with her asthma. This is referred to as her \"personal best.\" When your child's asthma is not doing well or is at risk of flaring up (eg, during a \"cold\"), a peak flow reading can be obtained and the value compared to the child's personal best. Using a simple range of color zones—green, yellow, and red, like traffic lights—specific recommendations can be spelled out as to what needs to be done to prevent a full-blown asthma attack based on what color zone the patient falls into with her peak flow measurement. How to Use a Peak Flow Meter Your child's peak flow–based asthma treatment plan uses his own personal best peak flow reading because every child is unique. Your child's peak flow may be higher or lower than that of another child even though their age, sex, and height are identical. To find your child's personal best, your pediatrician will instruct him to use the peak flow meter at the same time every day for 2 to 3 weeks during a period when he doesn't have any symptoms and asthma is under good control. ​To obtain a peak flow measurement, have your child do the following:\t Stand up. Place the peak flow device indicator at 0. Take a deep breath, then place the device well in to the mouth. Close his lips around the mouthpiece and keep his tongue clear of the opening. Blow once as hard and fast as he can. Note the reading.\t   Repeat steps 2 through 5 twice more and write down the highest score.\t After your child has established his personal best your doctor may ask him to use the meter for readings when he is beginning to have symptoms, or when he has a \"cold\" (a time when asthma commonly gets worse). The doctor may also ask you to monitor his peak flow when adjustments have been made to his medication program, whether it be up or down, to detect any change in asthma control. ​Starting at about age 4 or 5 years, your child can learn how to use a peak flow meter.\t The following color zone system is commonly used with peak flow monitoring:\t Green means that the airflow score is at 80% to 100% of your child's personal best peak flow (the targeted peak flow value determined by your child's pediatrician); his medications don't need to be adjusted and he may continue full activity. Yellow means  caution , just as it does on the road with a traffic light; airflow is between 50% and 80% of your child's personal best and certain additional asthma medications should be started or increased to ward off symptoms. Red means  danger ; your child's score is less than 50% of his peak flow. Have your child take his quick-relief medications (usually a bronchodilator at a high dose to open up the airways and steroid pills or liquid to calm inflammation) if it is part of the asthma action plan worked out between you and your pediatrician or asthma specialist. Call or see your physician soon, or go for emergency care, if the peak flow reading stays below 50% despite the treatment.\t The peak flow meter provides one way to measure asthma objectively, but it's critical that the child and everyone else in the family not rely on just a peak flow number for assessment of how a child's asthma is doing. Symptoms are as important, probably even more important, than a peak flow reading. It is not uncommon for symptoms to detect a flare-up of asthma even before peak flow measurements do.",

        "content": "By: Claire McCarthy, MD, FAAP When I was growing up, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches were really common in the school lunchroom. These days, most parents wouldn't even think of sending one. We've moved from peanut-free lunch tables to peanut-free schools—and many camps and afterschool programs have banned anything peanut too. They do it to    save lives . Not only has the prevalence of peanut allergy  doubled  in Western countries over a decade, it is the leading cause of    food allergy  related death in the United States. Finally we may have an answer, and it is the simplest answer of all: eating peanuts. Not actual peanuts—they are a serious    choking  hazard—but things made from peanuts, like peanut butter. \t \t \t Previous recommendations on when to introduce peanut products in a child's diet For many years, experts thought that the best way to fight peanut allergy was to avoid peanut products in the first years of life—that's why in 2000 the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended that any child at high risk of peanut allergy (like those with a family history of it, or with other food allergies, or    eczema ) not eat any before they turned 3.  But that didn't help, which is why in 2008 the AAP stopped recommending it. Surprising new research on peanut allergies Around this time, researchers in the UK noticed something interesting: peanut allergy in Jewish children living in the UK was about 10 times more common than it was in Jewish children living in Israel. Since these children shared a similar ancestry, the difference had to be something that they were doing. It turned out there was a big diet difference. Children in the UK rarely ate peanut products in the first year or so of life—whereas children in Israel commonly ate a snack called Bamba, a corn puff made with peanut butter. The researchers wondered: Could this be the important difference—that the Israeli children ate peanut products from an early age? So they tested it. They did a study on about 600 babies who had severe eczema or egg allergy, which are known to increase the risk of peanut allergies. They divided them up into two groups: one was given Bamba to eat regularly (if they didn't like Bamba, they could eat smooth peanut butter), and the other was told to stay away from foods containing peanuts. They did this until the children were 5 years old. At 5 years, only 3 percent of the kids who ate peanut products were allergic to them—compared with 17 percent of those who didn't eat peanuts. This included children who tested positive for a peanut allergy as infants (those with strong positive tests, however, were not included in the study). New peanut allergy advice When this research was released, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases came out with    guidelines  to help pediatricians and parents understand and use this news. The AAP endoresed those guidelines, and in a new    clinical report  underlines their importance.  The guidelines divide babies into three groups:    Those with severe    eczema  (persistent or recurrent eczema who need prescription creams frequently) and/or egg allergy Those with mild to moderate eczema Those who don't have any eczema or food allergy For the first group, those with severe eczema and/or egg allergy, testing for peanut allergy is recommended—and parents should talk with their doctors about how and when to give peanut products.  If testing shows an allergy, it may be a good idea to do that first taste of peanut product in the doctor's office. Parents of babies in this group should talk to their doctor early, like at the  2 - or  4-month  checkup, because the recommendation is that these babies should get peanut products between 4 and 6 months.  There is no testing needed for babies with mild to moderate eczema, although they should still talk with their doctors about their child's situation and needs. These babies should try peanut products at around 6 months of age.  The babies who don't have any eczema or food allergy can have peanut products along with other foods based on their family's preferences and cultural practices. It's not so important to do it early, but it's fine if parents do.  It's very important not to give babies whole peanuts or chunks of them (or chunky peanut butter), because babies could choke. Smooth peanut butter mixed into a puree is better, as are snacks or foods made with peanut butter.  We don't know if this will work for other food allergies, so if there are other allergies you are looking to prevent, talk to your doctor.

Luke's mother shares the problem, dismissing it as mild  hay fever , and something her son has to learn to live with. Lately, however, Luke has also suffered attacks of  wheezing  and shortness of breath when he visits his grandparents and plays with their cats. Luke's pediatrician suspects allergic asthma and recommends some tests. Luke's symptoms are by no means rare among children across the United States. Allergies and asthma often start in childhood and continue throughout life. Although neither can be cured, with proper care they can usually be kept under control.  What causes allergies? Allergies are caused by the body's reaction to substances called \"allergens.\" Allergies trigger the immune system to react to harmless substances as though they were attacking the body. Some allergies are easy to identify by the pattern of symptoms that follows exposure to a particular substance. But others are subtler, and may masquerade as other conditions. Here are some common clues that could lead you to suspect your child may have an allergy. When to suspect an allergy Repeated or chronic cold-like symptoms that last more than a week or two, or that develop at about the same time every year. Allergy symptoms could include: Runny nose Nasal stuffiness Sneezing Throat clearing Nose rubbing Sniffling Snorting Sneezing Itchy, runny eyes Itching or tingling sensations in the mouth and throat. Itchiness is not usually a complaint with a cold, but it is the hallmark of an allergy problem. Coughing, wheezing, difficulty breathing, and other respiratory symptoms. Recurrent red, itchy, dry, sometime scaly  rashes  in the creases of the skin, wrists and ankles also may indicate an allergy. What is eczema? When it comes to rashes, the most common chronic inflammatory skin condition in children is  eczema , also called atopic dermatitis. Although not strictly an allergic disorder, eczema in young children has many of the hallmarks of allergies and is often a sign that hay fever and asthma may develop. The rate of eczema, like that of asthma, is increasing throughout the world. Where asthma is rare, the rate of eczema is also low. What is the difference between allergies and asthma? Although allergies and asthma often go together, they are actually two different conditions. Here are three important facts: Asthma is a chronic condition that starts in the lungs. Allergies are reactions that start in the immune system. Not everybody with allergies has asthma, but most people with asthma have allergies. What is an asthma attack? The airways of the typical child with asthma are inflamed or swollen. This makes them oversensitive. When they come in contact with an  asthma \"trigger\" —something that causes an  asthma attack —the airways (called bronchial tubes) overreact by constricting (getting narrower). Many different substances and events can \"trigger\" an asthma attack, including: Exercise Cold air Viruses Air pollution Certain fumes Other allergens In fact, about  80%  of children with asthma also have allergies and, for them, allergens are often the most common asthma triggers. Common allergens in home and school In the fall, many indoor allergens cause problems for children because they are inside of home and school for longer periods. Indoor allergens include: Dust: contains dust mites and finely ground particles from other allergens, such as pollen, mold, and animal dander Fungi: including molds too small to be seen with the naked eye Furry animals: cats, dogs, guinea pigs, gerbils, rabbits, and other pets Clothing and toys: items made, trimmed, or stuffed with animal hair Latex: household and school articles, such as rubber gloves, toys, balloons; elastic in socks, underwear, and other clothing; airborne particles Bacterial enzymes: used to manufacture enzyme bleaches and cleaning products Certain foods How to control allergy symptoms It's helpful to use air conditioners, where possible, to reduce exposure to pollen in both your home and your car. Molds are present in the spring and late summer, particularly around areas of decaying vegetation. Children with mold allergies should avoid playing in piles of dead leaves in the fall. Dust mites congregate in places where food for them (such as flakes of human skin) is plentiful. That means they are most commonly found in upholstered furniture, bedding, and rugs. Padded furnishings, such as mattresses, box springs, pillows, and cushions should be encased in allergen-proof, zip-up covers, which are available through catalogs and specialized retailers. Wash linens weekly, and other bedding such as blankets, every 2 to 3 weeks in hot water to kill the dust mite. Pillows should be replaced every 2 to 3 years. Working with your child's pediatrician Your child's allergy and/or asthma treatment should start with your pediatrician. If needed, your pediatrician may refer you to a  pediatric allergy specialist  for additional evaluations and  treatments , depending on how severe the child's symptoms are. There are many over-the-counter antihistamines, decongestants and nasal sprays. However, it is very important that you work with a pediatrician over the years to make sure that your child's allergy and asthma are correctly diagnosed and the symptoms properly treated.",

        "content": "Skin tests, first developed almost a century ago, are still the mainstay of allergy testing. They are easy and safe to do, give fast results, and are relatively inexpensive, which makes them the best way to start looking for specific  allergies . In performing      scratch  skin tests, drops of allergen extracts (eg, pollens,  dust mites , molds,  animal danders ,  foods ) are allowed to seep through shallow scratches made in the patient's skin. The tests can also be performed by the deeper,      intradermal  technique, in which extracts are injected under the skin. There are pros and cons to both testing methods.\t   ​Scratch tests are painless and very easy to do. They are somewhat less sensitive than intradermal tests; they are also less likely to cause a severe reaction in someone who is highly allergic. The intradermal tests, which let the allergen extracts penetrate deeper into the skin, are highlysensitive, but they can occasionally result in false-positive reactions, indicating allergies where none exist.\t Your physician may decide to start with scratch tests, then go on to intradermal testing if further information is needed. Before testing, your doctor will ask you not to give your child any antihistamines for 3 to 5 days, as they will interfere with the results of the tests.   If your child has formed specific IgE antibodies through earlier exposure to one of the substances being tested, the skin test area will redden and swell into a disk that looks like a  mosquito bite  around the puncture site. This skin reaction usually peaks within 15 to 20 minutes after the test extracts are applied, and then gradually clears up. The skin where the tests were done may feel itchy for a few hours. Skin Tests Must Be Done by an Experienced Physician Although a positive result to scratch or intradermal skin testing strongly suggests that your child has formed lgE antibodies against a specific allergen, it does not follow that your child will definitely develop allergy symptoms when exposed to that particular allergen in the environment. As a rule, the bigger the skin test reaction, the higher the chances are that your child is allergic and will sneeze, itch, or break out in a rash. However, in some cases the skin reaction is trivial while the symptoms are overwhelming, and vice versa. Further, even though your child may have diminished symptoms as he gets older, the skin test result can remain positive. It is important that tests be conducted and results interpreted by someone trained and experienced in allergy skin testing. This Is Only a Test Many parents and children are afraid of having allergy skin testing because they've heard false reports that it is painful and upsetting. Scratch tests, the form of testing most often used in children, are mostly painless because they are done on the surface of the skin, where there aren't any nerve endings to register pain. Furthermore, new test devices are available that can do up to 8 tests at a time and allow scratch testing to be done quickly and without injury. The intradermal technique uses a very fine needle to penetrate the surface of the skin. It is \"felt\" a little more than scratch testing but is still not very painful. Many people also falsely believe that children have to reach a certain age before they can be tested. In fact, age is no barrier to skin testing; positive results can be obtained at any age. For example, in infants and toddlers who have  eczema  and suspected food allergy, skin tests often reveal sensitivity to milk or egg. Once parents have this information, they can keep those foods out of their child's diet to control allergy symptoms. Finally, experienced doctors and nurses perform allergy testing on a daily basis. They know how to take away fears and put children—and parents—at ease.",

        "content": "Instead of  skin tests , your pediatrician or allergy specialist may order a blood test that has various names, including specific IgE blood test, in vitro IgE test, and radioallergosorbent test (RAST). (When the test was first invented years ago, it was called RAST, based on the specific way the test was done in the laboratory. Even though that technique is no longer used, the name RAST has kind of hung on.) The specific IgE blood test is especially useful if skin tests cannot be done because, for instance, a child has eczema over much of his body or cannot be taken off medication that interferes with skin testing. This blood test shows specific sensitivities, as skin tests do, but does so by detecting the presence of allergy antibodies circulating in the blood. If antibodies are in the blood, it usually means the same antibodies are also in other tissues. The method is not quite as versatile as skin testing because certain extracts are not available for measuring specific IgE using this technique. For example, a specific IgE blood test cannot be used to detect sensitivity to medications and is rarely used to detect insect venom allergy. However, the specific IgE blood test, in general, is adaptable and sensitive enough to detect a wide range of allergies. The procedure costs more per test than skin testing. It requires only a few minutes of the patient’s time to draw a blood sample and there is no risk of any allergic reaction. The results take from 1 to 5 days, whereas skin test results are available immediately. Radiographs and Imaging Tests While sometimes useful,      radiographs  (x-ray films) are not essential for diagnosing asthma or allergies. In fact, people with asthma usually have normal chest radiographs. However, chest radiographs are sometimes done to make sure children do not have other conditions that can mimic asthma. Sinus infection can produce symptoms similar to those of respiratory allergies, and children who have respiratory allergies are prone to sinus infections. Your pediatrician may order an imaging test to see if your child simply has a prolonged or recurrent infection, or whether a sinus infection is complicating his allergies. An imaging test can be done the old-fashioned way, with a radiograph of the head, or it can be performed by computed tomography (CT). A      CT scan  is more sensitive than a radiograph and shows finer details of the anatomy of the sinuses, which can help your pediatrician decide on the best way to treat your child’s sinus problem. Finally, imaging tests can sometimes help your pediatrician identify the reason your child snores or has a permanently stuffed-up nose. A radiograph of the upper neck area can show if the stuffiness is caused by enlargement of the adenoid tissue, which sits in the upper throat just behind the nose. Lung Function Tests If your child has symptoms indicating possible      asthma , your pediatrician or asthma specialist may perform tests to evaluate his lung function. Lung function tests are performed in your pediatrician’s office or a pulmonary function laboratory where special equipment is available. An instrument called a  spirometer  is used to measure how much air your child can breathe out, as well as how fast the air flows. The technician will place a clip over your child’s nose to prevent air escaping from the nostrils. The technician will then ask your child to perform breathing maneuvers into a mouthpiece attached to a pulmonary function monitor. The maneuvers aren’t difficult or painful. All your child has to do is take a deep breath, then breathe out forcefully through the mouthpiece. Instead of using a spirometer, the doctor may ask your child to blow into a simpler device called a  peak flow meter . Your pediatrician usually has your child perform the lung function test at least 3 times at a sitting to make sure results are consistent. If lung function testing shows that your child cannot blow air out fast enough, your pediatrician may perform further tests for asthma. Your pediatrician may give your child a dose of      bronchodilator medication  to see if there is a change in airflow. If airflow is normal or improved after the medication, the result strongly suggests that asthma is present. Sweat Test\t Cystic fibrosis  is an inherited disorder that involves many body systems. It causes symptoms in the respiratory and digestive tracts that can mimic those of asthma and allergies. A child with cystic fibrosis may have asthma or allergies, as well. Your pediatrician may order tests to measure the levels of certain minerals in your child’s sweat (commonly called a sweat test). If the results indicate cystic fibrosis, further tests will be done to confirm the diagnosis.",

        "content": "I n recent years, research into the diagnosis and treatment of childhood asthma has made a real difference in the control of asthma among children. The burden of asthma is greater for children than for the rest of the population. Asthma is the most common lasting disorder in childhood, currently affecting around 6.2 million Americans under 18 years of age. The reason why some people get asthma and others do not is still largely a mystery. Research findings have identified factors associated with asthma development, but none have proven to be the cause. However, when it comes to controlling asthma, the results have been far more helpful.\t Asthma occurs when the small airways of the lungs become inflamed and narrower. Today’s asthma medicines help reduce airway inflammation and relieve or prevent airways from narrowing. Two types of medicines are currently used to treat asthma: anti-inflammatory agents and bronchodilators (medicines that dilate, or expand, the bronchial air tubes).\t Anti-inflammatory drugs halt the current airway inflammation and may also prevent future inflammation from developing. These types of drugs include corticosteroids, cromolyn sodium, and other anti-inflammatory compounds, and are usually inhaled. A new class of anti-inflammatory medications known as leukotriene inhibitors blocks the activity of chemicals called leukotrienes (LOU-koh-treenz) that are involved in airway inflammation.\t An Individual Approach\t Perhaps the most promising advance in treatment is an individualized approach to asthma therapy. Not all asthma patients respond to the currently approved treatment medications. Individualized reductions of asthma triggers (allergies, secondhand smoke, cold dry air, et al.) and individualized therapy addresses that problem. Today, pediatricians are moving toward improving asthma control and identifying new therapies that will help to stop asthma symptoms completely for each patient.\t Researchers hope that an individual approach to treating asthma will lead to new information about what may cause poorly controlled asthma and potential new targets for therapies. This approach will be the topic for future research to advance asthma care for children.\t The Asthma–Sinusitis Connection\t Sometimes the symptoms of asthma continue even when patients are on appropriate medications. Research has shown a relationship between sinusitis and asthma. For some children who do not improve with asthma therapy, aggressively treating sinusitis (inflammation of the sinuses) may also significantly improve asthma symptoms and quality of life.\t The sinuses are the hollow air spaces within the bones surrounding the nose. They can become blocked, resulting in infection and inflammation within the sinus space, leading to sinusitis. Not only does sinusitis trigger asthma at times, an important symptom of sinusitis in children, namely coughing, can mimic asthma.\t Sinusitis in children is underreported in the medical community, notes Dr. Frank Virant, Clinical Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Sinusitis often begins as a cold that then turns into a bacterial infection after long periods of inflammation. The symptoms can be different from those seen in adults. For example, children report sinus pain less often than adults. Sometimes the diagnosis can be difficult to make. A cough that continues for weeks may indicate sinusitis and persistent inflammation, adds Dr. Virant.\t Dr. Virant also notes that certain children appear to have colds all the time. “Most childhood colds should last 5 to 7 days, not continue for weeks with constant coughing,” he says. When treating children with asthma, physicians should not forget to pay attention to the upper respiratory tract, as these steps can also benefit asthma control.\t Other Advances in Childhood Asthma Research\t New guidelines for asthma diagnosis and treatment were developed by the country’s leading asthma experts that help doctors treat asthma even more effectively. While inhaled corticosteroids therapy continues to be the preferred treatment for persistent asthma, other recent advances in understanding childhood asthma include:\t Questionnaires about asthma symptoms are good at predicting future asthma episodes in people older than 10 years of age, but are not as effective with younger children.\t Evaluating and managing severe asthma should include assessment for other illnesses that can either mimic or aggravate asthma and make it difficult to control.\t Treatments that work best include taking medications as prescribed, using the inhaled medications with proper inhaler technique, and, sometimes, using a combination of medications.\t Using inhaled corticosteroids early in childhood asthma reduces illness but does not alter the natural progression of the disease.\t Each patient responds differently to asthma treatment. That is true even among patients whose asthma symptoms are about equally severe. This difference in treatment response points to the importance of gauging asthma symptom control and making adjustments as needed.\t An individualized approach to asthma treatment seems to work best. \t Asthma Fast Facts\t Secondhand smoke can cause serious harm to children, especially those with asthma. An estimated 400,000 to 1 million asthmatic children have their condition worsened by exposure to secondhand smoke.\t Asthma is the third leading cause of hospitalization among children under the age of 15.\t Within the last few years, death and hospitalizations due to asthma have generally decreased, except for small children. Over 9 million U.S. children under 18 years of age (13 percent) have been diagnosed with asthma, and 6.5 million children (9 percent)  currently have asthma.\t Boys are more likely to have asthma than girls.\t This article was featured in Healthy Children Magazine.

        "content": "Asthma is a chronic disease of the tubes that carry air to the lungs. These airways become narrow and their linings become swollen, irritated, and inflamed. In patients with asthma, the airways are always irritated and inflamed, even though symptoms are not always present. The degree and severity of airway inflammation varies over time. Children with asthma may also be sensitive to colds and other viral infections, cold air, and particles or chemicals in the air. Ongoing exposures to these substances will not only worsen asthma symptoms, but also continue to aggravate airway inflammation. Inflammation of the airways causes them to be oversensitive and “twitchy,” often called “hyperreactive.” When the airways are hyperreactive, they can go into spasms, causing blockage and symptoms of wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. ​Children with asthma can have symptoms start or worsen when they are exposed to many indoor substances such as\t Dust and dust mites Cockroaches Animals such as cats and dogs Molds Secondhand cigarette smoke\t Who Gets Asthma? Asthma is a common condition in childhood. In the United States, 10% to 15% of children in grade school have or have had asthma. It can cause a lot of sickness and result in hospital stays and even death. The number of children with asthma is increasing, and the amount of illness due to asthma may also be increasing in some parts of the country. The reasons for these increases are not exactly known; however, outdoor air pollution and increased exposure to allergens are not likely causes. Recent studies suggest that how often and how early a child is exposed to certain infections and animals can influence the development of asthma. For example, children who come from large families, live with pets, or spend a considerable amount of time in child care in the first year of life are less likely to develop asthma. This early exposure to common allergens may actually protect against the development of asthma. Studies have also shown that a child’s exposure to infections early in life can determine whether he develops allergies or asthma. Some infections seem to decrease the risk of developing asthma, whereas one infection, respiratory syncytial virus, increases the risk. How Is Asthma Treated? Any child who has asthma symptoms more than twice per week should be treated. One of the most important treatments of asthma is to control the underlying inflammation of the airways. This can be done with medications or by avoiding environmental factors that cause or aggravate airway inflammation. Knowing the causes and triggers for asthma can allow families to reduce or avoid these triggers and reduce ongoing airway inflammation and hyperreactivity. This can reduce the severity and frequency of asthma symptoms and, hopefully, the need for as much asthma medication.",

        "content": "By: Clinton Dunn MD, FAAP & Addie Dodson, MD, FAAP  You may have been given an asthma action plan for your child after a doctor's office visit, a trip to the emergency department, or after your child was hospitalized. Ideally, everyone with asthma should have an asthma action plan specific to them. Why is it important to have an asthma action plan? An asthma action plan is designed to help families manage their child's asthma. The goal is to avoid asthma emergencies. The plan can guide parents and caregivers on what medications to use, and when to use them, to prevent and control flare-ups. Create an asthma action plan for your child\t Download this  asthma action plan  so you and your pediatrician can personalize it for your child. Save and print it for your records. Be sure to share it with your child's    school  and anyone else who cares for your child.  Because asthma affects people differently, asthma action plans are customized for your child. While every asthma action plan looks a little bit different, they all include the same major parts. The asthma action plan format: what's included? Asthma action plans include a list of the child's asthma medications taken, early warning signs for asthma symptoms, instructions on when to use the medicines and call your health care provider, and when to seek emergency care. Traffic light color zones Your child's asthma action plan will be divided into a traffic light format (with the colors green, yellow and red), based on your child's symptoms and how they feel.\t Green means go!  This is your child's everyday plan and when they are feeling good.\t Yellow means proceed with caution . This is for when your child is not feeling quite right. Continue to follow everything in the green zone; the yellow zone adds on other options to help prevent more problems or worsening symptoms.\t Red zone means danger!  This is urgent, when your child needs medications quickly and fast medical attention to prevent symptoms from getting even worse. Family & health care provider contacts Every asthma action plan should have information about your child, including name and family contact information. It should also have the name and phone number for the doctor who takes care of your child's asthma, whether it is your pediatrician or an asthma specialist. Peak flow tracking information Depending on your child's age, there may be a number written on the top of your asthma action plan. This number measures how hard your child can breathe out when feeling healthy on a peak flow machine. It is a good way to see if your child's breathing effort is normal and can be used daily to track how their lungs are doing. How to match color zones with your child's asthma symptoms Green Zone:  Every day The green zone represents what you should do when your child is feeling completely normal. This is what to do when your child is breathing comfortably, sleeping through the night, not having any coughing or wheezing, and can play just like other kids. It means your child's peak flow range is normal. Your child's daily controller medication will be listed here, along with how much to take and when to take it. This is the medication that your child should take   every day. Examples include inhaled steroids or anti-allergy medication. Some children have    exercise -induced asthma, or asthma symptoms that flare up when they exercise or play actively. For children with this issue, the medicine they need to take before exercise will also be listed in the Green Zone. This includes how much to take, and when to take it before play.\t Yellow Zone:  First signs of illness\t This yellow zone is for when your child may be starting to get sick and is at risk of having an asthma flare. Symptoms include: cough or cold symptoms, some wheezing, having a known    trigger  for a flare (like change in weather), coughing at night, or having a tight chest or belly pain (little kids have a hard time knowing if they are having belly pain or chest pain). The peak flow range listed will be less than normal. Your child will need to take all their Green Zone medication    PLUS  the medication listed in the Yellow zone. The Asthma Action Plan will include how much medicine to take and how often. Your asthma action plan will also list when to call your child's doctor if the symptoms are not improving or getting worse.\t Red Zone:  This is urgent! This red zone is for when your child is sick and their asthma flare is dangerous: medicine is not helping, you notice your child is breathing hard and/or fast, you can see your child's ribs while they are breathing, your child's nose is opening wider when they breathe (called \"nasal flaring\"), or your child cannot talk because they are having a hard time breathing. The peak flow range listed will be low. Call your doctor immediately! If it is after the office is closed, go to the    emergency department  or    call 911  if you cannot take your child there yourself. You should also give all the Green Zone medications AND whatever rescue medications are listed in your Red Zone. Your child's asthma action plan will also include how much of the medicine to take and how often. It may be a higher dose of the Yellow Zone medication that you also give as well more frequently. Remember If you have any questions about the asthma action plan, or you do not have one but think your child could benefit, please talk with your child's pediatrician.

        "content": "Furry pets are among the most common and potent causes of allergy symptoms. However, fur usually is not the only animal allergen. Even shorthaired, \"non-shedding\" animals leave a trail of dander and saliva. Cats are commonly more allergenic than dogs. Although certain breeds of dogs are said to be less allergenic than others, studies don't support the claim. Comparisons of dogs also show wide differences in levels of allergen-creation between individual dogs of the same breed. Reptiles, fish, and amphibians are not generally causes of allergy. Making Adjustments For families with a member allergic to an animal that are deeply attached to their animals, the notion of finding another home for a pet is hard to accept. Many prefer to keep the animal and battle on against allergy symptoms. If you can't part with your pet, at least keep it out of your allergic child's bedroom, and sweep, dust, and vacuum frequently. Another solution may be to keep your cat or dog permanently outdoors with adequate shelter. Weekly bathing in tepid water has also been shown to lower a pet's potential allergens, including animals that never venture out of doors, but doing this regularly and consistently is often not realistic. Long after an animal has left the family home, animal allergens can persist due to hair and dander left behind. A household pet may be unjustly blamed for causing allergy symptoms. Don't automatically banish Fido to the doghouse unless your child's been tested and the results suggest that your child has an animal allergy. Occasionally, symptoms that seem to be caused by an animal may be, in fact, due to other allergies, such as to pollen or mold. What happens is that Fido and Felix explore outdoors, then come back into the house with a load of pollen granules and mold spores in their coats. Every time the hay fever sufferer pats the pets, he stirs up an invisible cloud of allergens that triggers symptoms. Before You Consider a New Pet…\t   It is unwise to bring home a furry pet if you have a strong family history of allergies and, consequently, a high risk that infants and young children in your home could develop allergies. Better to wait a few years and, then, if there are no signs of trouble and your child's allergy tests are clear, you may want to look into pet ownership. Try to expose your child to the pet a few times before bringing the pet home, just to see if there are any allergic symptoms that would indicate this is not the right move for your child.   Tips for Handling Pet Allergies More than 70 percent of U.S. households have a dog or cat, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (ACAAI). People with allergies should be cautious in deciding what type of pet they can safely bring into their home. The ACAAI offers the following advice: Pet exposure may cause sneezing and wheezing. An estimated 10 percent of the population may be allergic to animals, and 20 to 30 percent of individuals with asthma have pet allergies. The best types of pets for an allergic patient are pets that don't have hair or fur, shed dander, or produce excrement that creates allergic problems. Tropical fish are ideal, but very large aquariums could add to the humidity in a room, which could result in an increase of molds and house dust mites. Other hypoallergenic pets include reptiles and turtles, but be aware that turtles can spread salmonella, a highly contagious bacterial disease. If the family is unwilling to remove the pet, it should at least be kept out of the patient's bedroom and, if possible, outdoors. Allergic individuals should not pet, hug, or kiss their pets because of the allergens on the animal's fur or saliva. ​Indoor pets should be restricted to as few rooms in the home as possible.\t   Isolating the pet to one room, however, will not entirely limit the allergens to that room. Air currents from forced-air heating and air-conditioning will spread the allergens throughout the house. Homes with forced-air heating and/or air-conditioning may be fitted with a central air cleaner. This may remove significant amounts of pet allergens from the home. The air cleaner should be used at least four hours per day. The use of heating and air-conditioning filters and HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Arresting) filters as well as vacuuming carpets, cleaning walls and washing the pet with water are all ways of reducing exposure to the pet allergen. When it comes to diagnosing pet allergies, most are pretty obvious — symptoms occur soon after exposure. But sometimes the allergy is subtler. Skin tests or special allergy blood tests can be done, if necessary, to confirm a suspicion of an animal allergy. One way to confirm a pet's significance as an allergen, is to remove the pet from the home for several weeks and do a thorough cleaning to remove the residual hair and dander. It is important to keep in mind that it can take weeks of thorough cleaning to remove all the animal hair and dander before a change in the allergic patient is noted. Allergy shots (immunotherapy) may be needed for cat or dog allergies, particularly when the animal cannot be avoided. They are typically given for at least three years and may decrease symptoms of asthma and allergy. They are not recommended as routine treatment for pet allergy in children, though. Avoidance and pet elimination are the preferred approach.",

        "content": "Many children    on the autism spectrum  may show developmental differences during their infant and toddlers years, especially in social and language skills.    There may be some delays in spoken language or differences in how they interact with peers. However, children on the autism spectrum usually sit, crawl, and walk on time. So, the subtler differences in the development of gestures (pointing), pretend play and social language often go unnoticed by families and doctors. Here is information about three of the early signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in young children.\t   Delay in or lack of joint attention One of the most important developmental differences between children on the autism spectrum and children without ASD is a delay in or lack of  joint attention . In fact, delays in joint attention skills are found in most children with ASD.  What is joint attention? Joint attention is looking back and forth between an object or event and another person and connecting with that person. It is a building block for later social and communication skills. Engaging in many back-and-forth social interactions, such as exchanging a lot of emotional expressions, sounds and other gestures, is called    reciprocal social interaction . Stages of joint attention in babies & toddlers There are several stages of joint attention. Children on the autism spectrum usually show delayed or absent social communication skills at every stage.  For example, below are ages when babies and toddlers toddlers typically use and understand gestures at the following times, compared with young children on the autism spectrum. Using & understanding gestures such as pointing By  12 months  of age: Most children  can immediately look in the direction of an object a parent is pointing at. They will then look back at the parent and mimic the parent's expression, usually a smile. Children on the autism spectrum  may appear to ignore the parent. This can cause parents to worry about their child's    hearing . By  15 months  of age: Most children  can point to out-of-reach objects that they want. A child on the autism spectrum  may instead take a parent's hand and lead the parent to the object without making much, if any, eye contact. Sometimes the child may even place the parent's hand onto the object itself. By  18 months  of age: Most children  point at objects they find interesting. Children will look back and forth between an object and a parent to make sure the parent is tuned-in to what they are looking at. Children on the autism disorder spectrum  will often point to an object because they want a parent to get it for them, not because they want the parent to enjoy looking at the object with them. Language delays & differences with ASD Almost all children on the autism disorder spectrum show delays in nonverbal communication and spoken language. For example, you may notice differences such as: The use of labels A child on the autism spectrum may have words they use to label things, for example, but not to ask for things. They may use words for objects before using words for people or family members.  Echoing & repeating Most young children go through a phase when they repeat what they hear. Children on the autism disorder spectrum may repeat what they hear for a longer period. They also may repeat dialogue from movies or conversations with the tone of voice they heard them in. This is called    parroting  or    echoing .  Some children later diagnosed on the autism spectrum will seem to have met language milestones during the toddler years. However, their use of language may be unusual. For example, they may talk more like an adult than a toddler. Regression in developmental milestones & skills About 25% of children later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder may develop some  language  that they suddenly or gradually stop using. Typically, this may happen between the ages of 15 and 24 months. They might also become more socially withdrawn. This change is called a regression in skills. Screening toddlers for ASD\t The AAP recommends that all children be screened for autism spectrum disorder at their  18 - and \t   24 -month well-child checkups , in addition to routine developmental surveillance. Research shows that starting an intervention program as soon as possible can improve outcomes for many children on the autism spectrum. Remember If you have concerns about how your child plays, learns, speaks, acts or moves, talk with your pediatrician. Remember, you know your child best and your concerns are important.  Together, you and your pediatrician will find the best way to help your child. Don't wait. Acting early can make a big difference in your child's development.

        "content": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that can affect a child's social skills, communication and behavior. Because most children on the autism spectrum will sit, crawl and walk on time, you may not notice      delays  in social and communication skills right in the first year of life.  Looking back, many parents can recall early differences in interaction and communication.      See \t   What Are the Early Signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder? Children on the autism spectrum and their families can be healthy and resilient More research is needed to understand the course of development for children who are diagnosed on the autism spectrum. However, recent studies show that many children with an ASD diagnosis are healthy and doing well in mid-childhood.  How common is ASD? About 1 in 36 U.S. children (2.8%) are diagnosed on the autism spectrum by the time they are 8 years old, according to 2020 data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)      Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network​ .\t \t  Boys are diagnosed on the spectrum nearly 4 times more often than girls. Still, for the first time, reported ASD diagnoses among 8-year-old girls has exceeded 1%. Also reported for the first time, the percentage of 8-year-old Black (2.9%), Hispanic (3.2%) and Asian or Pacific Islander (3.3%) children identified on the autism spectrum was higher than among 8-year-old White children (2.4%). Overall, the number of children reported to be on the autism spectrum has increased since the early 1990s.      The increase could be caused by many factors. For example: Many families became more aware of autism spectrum disorder. Pediatricians began doing more            screening for autism spectrum disorder , as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Children are identified earlier, which is a good thing. Schools became more aware of ASD, and children began receiving more appropriate special education services. There have been changes in how autism spectrum disorder is defined and diagnosed.  What causes ASD? Children on the autism spectrum do not have one common cause or reason they have the condition. Many factors may lead to a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Scientists continue to learn more about what causes autism spectrum disorder. We currently know that:\t Families do not  cause autism spectrum disorder .\t Vaccines do not  cause autism spectrum disorder .\t Family medical history may play a role.  For a child diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, the chance that a sibling might also be diagnosed is 10 to 20 times higher than for the general population. Relatives of children on the autism spectrum are more likely to share some similar social and behavioral characteristics of those seen among children with autism spectrum disorder. However, these characteristics may not be severe enough to be diagnosed.\t Most children on the autism spectrum do not have a specific medical or genetic condition  that explains why.   However, autism spectrum disorder may occur more often in children with certain medical conditions or high-risk factors. These medical conditions can include fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, Down syndrome, or other genetic disorders. Infants born preterm are another high-risk group. \t There are specific differences in brain function  between a child on the autism spectrum and a child who is not on the autism spectrum.\t Environmental factors that may contribute to autism spectrum disorder  are also an important area of research; these are not yet well understood. Changes in how autism is defined & diagnosed  Doctors use a book called     \t Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)  to assist in diagnosing autism spectrum disorder. In the past, only children with the most severe autism spectrum disorder symptoms were diagnosed. But in 2013, the diagnostic criteria for ASD changed. This was based on the research literature and clinical experience in the two decades since the DSM-IV was published in 1994. Now, children with more subtle characteristics are being identified as on the autism spectrum. Several conditions used to be considered autism spectrum disorders in the DSM. Those conditions were: Autistic disorder Pervasive developmental disorder—not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) Asperger syndrome Childhood disintegrative disorder With publication of the fifth edition of the DSM in 2013, the terms listed above are no longer used and these conditions are now grouped in the broader category of autism spectrum disorder. Many people may self-identify as having Asperger Syndrome, but professionals should no longer use this terminology when making a diagnosis. The benefits of early identification of autism Early intervention Each child on the autism spectrum has different needs. The sooner autism spectrum disorder is identified, the sooner an      early intervention  program directed at the child's symptoms can begin.\t The AAP recommends that all children be screened for autism spectrum disorder at their  18 - and  24 -month well-child checkups.  Research shows that starting an intervention program as soon as possible can improve outcomes for many children on the autism spectrum. Co-existing conditions In addition, children on the autism spectrum may have other medical problems that need further evaluation and treatment. Commonly co-existing conditions, called comorbidities, may include seizures, problems with sleep, gastrointestinal problems (feeding problems, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea) and behavioral health problems such as anxiety, ADHD, irritability and aggression.  Some of these medical conditions may place children on the autism spectrum at increased risk for more severe illness and complications from infections such as      COVID-19 . How has COVID-19 affected autism screening? Earlier in the COVID pandemic, parents may have been worried about the safety of taking their children to the pediatrician for      well-child visits . CDC data suggests this impacted the frequency and timeliness of screening 4-year-olds for autism and other developmental delays.  Delays in well-child visits and autism screenings Prior to March 2020, communities were evaluating and identifying more young children on the autism spectrum than they had in the past. After March 2020, that progress was wiped out. Disruptions in the timely evaluation of children, along with delays in connecting children to the services and support they need, could have long-lasting effects.  Disruptions in school services & supports In addition, school, supports, activities and routines also were disrupted during to the pandemic. School closures and the absence of in-person interaction may have made it more difficult for teachers to recognize social and communication differences in their students. This may have meant more opportunities for early identification missed. Access to school services and therapies also became more difficult for many families because of the pandemic. Remember The pandemic has highlighted how, especially during times of change and uncertainty, it's important to stay connected. Remember to schedule your child's      well-child visits  with your pediatrician, especially if you have any concerns about your child's development or behavior. Talk to your pediatrician about the possibility of conducting these visits      virtually  if that is your preference. You can reach out to peer support organizations, such as      Family to Family Health Information Centers , for local information specific to children with special health care needs and disabilities.

        "content": "By: Kristin Sohl, MD, FAAP Being a teenager can be an exciting but challenging time, filled with big physical, emotional and social changes. It's not uncommon for teens to experience      mental health struggles . Like all kids, teens on the      autism spectrum  face mental health challenges, too. If your child is on the autism spectrum, here is information that can help you know when they may be struggling, and ways you can support them. Anxiety and depression among teens on the autism spectrum Anxiety and depression are common in autistic youth. In fact, many people on the spectrum experience more issues with anxiety and depression than their non-autistic peers. This may be because the way autistic teens socialize with their peers can be different from typical teen interactions. Autistic teens may also feel lonely or left out of social activities.\t   ​\t  Noticing changes: behavior as a clue to emotions  As a parent, caregiver, coach or other important adult in a teen's life, you can play a major role in supporting their mental health. Some of the most important things you can do is take notice of changes in their mood or patterns of behavior.  For example, take note if your teen eating or sleeping more or less than usual, spending more time alone, or is less interested in activities they usually enjoy. Some teens will be more emotional when they are feeling stressed, anxious or depressed. Some will be less engaged or even withdrawn from their friends, family, pets or activities. The important thing to remember is that noticing changes in behavior is an important clue. All teens navigate emotions in different ways. Autistic teens may have more or less ability to communicate verbally. So, their behavior will be a critical clue to what may be going on for them. Teens on the autism spectrum may show increased repetitive behaviors (for example, hand flapping), or insist on patterns of behavior. If you notice changes, this is a great time to check in. You can check in verbally by asking questions or non-verbally by being close and offering gentle signs of reassurance.  Therapy for teens on the autism spectrum We know that teens on the autism spectrum can respond well to common behavioral      therapy  just like their non-autistic peers. Counseling (behavioral therapy) options can work well including cognitive behavioral therapy. It's important to find a counselor who has experience working with people on the autism spectrum. There are some helpful adaptations that can increase the effectiveness of counseling for autistic people.  Sometimes it can be hard to know if a teen is struggling, and even harder to know when to step in as a trusted adult. This applies for all teens, autism or not. We know the      mental health crisis  is profoundly impacting many teens as they try to navigate their peers and their pressures. It is vital that caring adults pay attention to teens and changes in their behavior and emotions. Those changes can signal the need for support and services that may be lifesaving. Connecting with your teen & their pediatrician Families, caregivers, and other adults can listen to and engage with teens on the autism spectrum. You can help them feel they are heard and seen, and to share any mental health concerns with your pediatrician.     \t This is especially important because there are times when health care clinicians may not recognize serious mental health conditions that co-occur with autism spectrum disorder. Some clinicians don't realize that anxiety and depression are common in autism and important to screen, identify and treat.  This is where your child's pediatrician can be critical. When a child follows closely with a pediatrician through      infancy to adulthood , the clinician is able to support through critical changes and be an additional advocate when increased supports and services are needed. Your pediatrician can play a significant role in helping you and your child access needed intervention and support. If you are concerned, please reach out to them to help you and your teen know the next best step.  Remember While mental health concerns are common for teens on the autism spectrum, that doesn't mean everyone will have an additional mental health diagnosis. Even if your child is not having any concerns, it's always good to check in with them frequently, engage with them around their interests and enjoy time relaxing together. These are great ways to build      resilience  for stressful times and coping skills for the future.

        "content": "By: Robin K. Blitz, MD, FAAP If you have a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), you may be considering integrative, complementary or alternative health therapies. These are often referred to as CAM (complementary and alternative medicine). Maybe you're looking for extra help with your child's communication or behavior. Or you want to find some relief for their sleep problems. If you're interested in CAM    approaches , you're certainly not alone. Studies show that up to 95% of kids with ASD have tried some form of CAM. But many parents and caregivers say they don't tell their child's doctor about the CAM options they've used.  Remember, it's important to discuss   all aspects of your child's supports and services with your pediatrician. This includes therapies that seem to be \"natural.\"  Here's more information to help you navigate CAM.  What is complementary & alternative medicine (CAM)? Integrative, alternative and complementary therapies all fall under the CAM umbrella. CAM is any complementary health approach that falls outside of traditional medical care.  Examples include: Yoga Massage Herbal remedies Mindfulness Biological treatments such as melatonin, homeopathy, chelation or antifungals Special diets or supplements Acupuncture Hyperbaric oxygen Why do parents use CAM? Kids with autism spectrum disorder are at a higher risk of having other medical issues too, such as: Chronic  constipation Diarrhea Feeding disorders Abdominal pain Celiac disease Gastroesophageal reflux Seizures Sleep problems Behavioral and psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, aggression and self-injurious behaviors These problems are often what parents are trying to address by using CAM.  Is CAM right for my child? Few studies have been done on the benefits and safety of CAM for children with ASD. Sometimes, these treatments can interact with medication that your child has been prescribed. (Seizure medications are one example.) These types of therapies are usually not covered by insurance, so they can be expensive. Herbal supplements are also not regulated for safety by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) like prescription medicine is.  What to consider with CAM Here are some important things to keep in mind about CAM for your child with ASD:\t Be careful with \"natural\" items.  Remember, just because something is labeled as \" natural \" or \"organic\" doesn't mean it's harmless. For example, natural supplements can interfere with other medications. They can also cause their own side effects. Taking too much of a supplement can be dangerous too.\t Be wary of biological treatments.  This includes treatments such as  hyperbaric oxygen  secretin (a gastrointestinal hormone),  chelation therapies  and antifungals. They may claim to help kids with ASD improve their communication or reduce interfering behaviors. But these treatments are not scientifically proven to help. In fact, they can be hazardous.\t Don't jump on the nutrition bandwagon.  Special  diets  and vitamin supplements may be popular. But that doesn't mean that they're safe or necessary. There may be a medical reason your child needs a special diet or vitamins. If not, it's best to discuss their nutrition with their doctor.\t Treat music therapy and equine-assisted therapy as add-ons.  Recreational activities like music and  horseback riding  may be fun for your child. But remember that right now, scientific evidence doesn't support these activities for treating the core symptoms of ASD.\t Consider melatonin for sleep issues.   Melatonin  may be helpful for some kids with ASD who struggle with sleep. Be sure to talk to your pediatrician before giving your child melatonin.\t Never replace regular treatments with CAM options.  For example, using supplements instead of prescription medication can be extremely dangerous. It can even be deadly. There is also no clear evidence that the following CAM therapies help kids with ASD: Omega-3 fatty acids Acupuncture Modified mindfulness-based therapy Qigong massage  and other massage therapies Oxytocin  (the hormone) This means it's not safe to use any of these in place of your child's usual doctor-approved treatments. Talk with your pediatrician Remember, it's important to discuss every part of your child's care with your pediatrician. This includes any CAM interventions that you're interested in. It's your pediatrician's job to make sure your child is healthy and safe. That way, you can team with your doctor to target symptoms you want to address. Your doctor can find appropriate supports and services for these. They can also help you avoid any harmful or unproven therapy options.

        "content": "By: Kristin Sohl, MD, FAAP \t We all go through transitions in life. Some of these transitions just happen, like when your infant became an active toddler. Others go more smoothly when we prepare. If you are a parent or caregiver of someone with autism spectrum disorder, preparing them and yourself for the transition to adulthood can be a game-changer. Planning can make the difference between a successful transition or a stressful situation for both the teenager on the autism spectrum and their parent or caregiver.  Here's what we know:  People on the autism spectrum tend to like predictability. Change can be hard, and transition to adulthood is all about change. It starts happening around age 12 and continue into adulthood: body changes caused by hormones, environment changes with school and healthcare, life skill changes with responsibilities and roles and so much more. Legally things change at 18, too. What is your role as a parent or caregiver or as an autistic pre-teen/teen?  Start learning the transition steps. It's a good idea to start thinking about transition to adulthood at age 12. Transition steps may include healthcare, plans after high school, legal changes after age 18 and daily living plans.  Ask for guidance along the way. Don't hesitate to ask your pediatrician for guidance and support. Pediatricians can help you find an adult health care specialist, for example. They can also guide you to local and national resources to help you and your child create plans for the future.    GotTransition.org  is one example of a trusted resource with information on transition and healthcare.  Stay connected with your child's pediatrician. Regular visits with your pediatrician are critical to staying connected with them as a trusted resource. As an expert in children and youth, they can help guide you through the next stages of developing into adult.  Help your child develop their voice. A critical part of transitioning to adulthood is helping your child develop their voice to advocate for their own health and wellness goals. Work with your pediatrician and your child to build skills to navigate their healthcare like making appointments, filling prescriptions and medical decision making.  Remember  Transition to adulthood is filled with many milestones. Just as when your child transitioned from infant to toddler and the many stages that followed, your pediatrician is a vital partners in this stage of development, too. As a team, autistic youth, parents and caregivers and pediatricians can plan for and achieve successful transitions into adulthood.

        "content": "It would be so much easier if    autism spectrum disorer (ASD)  could be diagnosed with a blood test or an x-ray, but  it's not that simple.  A diagnosis of ASD is ultimately made based on your description of your child's development, plus careful observations of certain behaviors by your pediatrician, autism experts, medical tests and your child's history.   Early diagnosis requires a partnership between parents and pediatricians.  Within this partnership you, as the parent, should feel comfortable bringing up any concerns you have about your child's behavior or development—the way he or she plays, learns, speaks and acts. Likewise, your child's pediatrician's role in the partnership is to listen and act on your concerns. During your child's visits, the pediatrician may ask specific questions or  complete a questionnaire about your child's development . Pediatricians take these steps because they understand the value of early diagnosis and intervention and know where to refer you if concerns are identified. The importance of this partnership cannot be stressed enough. Why ALL children are screened for autism:    If your child does have autism, an early diagnosis is better because then your child can start receiving the help he or she needs. This is why  the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends all children be  screened for ASD   a t their 18- and 24-month well-child checkups.   Talk with your doctor if you feel your child needs to be screened (regardless of their age) and share your concerns—you know your child the best! If your child recieves an autism diagnosis: Learning your child has a lifelong   developmental disability  is difficult. Naturally, you as a parent, other caregivers, and extended family need to grieve about this. You will undoubtedly worry about what the future holds.  Keep in mind during these difficult times that most children with ASD will make significant progress in overall function. Some children with ASD can do exceptionally well and may even remain in a regular education classroom. Many will have meaningful relationships with family and peers and achieve a good level of independence as adults.   It is important to remember that while a diagnosis of autism may change what you thought your parenting experience would be, we now know that children with ASD can achieve so much more in life as long as they are given appropriate support and opportunities. ( See \" Words of Support for Parents of a Child with Autism .\") Health insurance, coding & billing questions for ASD  Because the DSM-5 criteria combine all previous subdiagnoses under one condition (ASD), there may be inconsistency between insurance billing databases and DSM-5 diagnoses.  Parents, see the  Health Insurance   section on HealthyChildren.org for helpful articles and information you'll need on your journey. Both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM contain specific codes for subdiagnoses, including Asperger's Syndrome.  Therefore, it  is recommended that services provided for children with ASD are reported with codes such as ICD-9-CM code 299.00 or 299.01. On or after Oct. 1, 2014 , report ICD-10-CM code F84.0. Editor's note:  Children with ASD may have other medical problems that may need further evaluation and treatment. These may include seizures, problems with sleep, gastrointestinal problems (feeding problems, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and behavioral health problems (such as anxiety, ADHD, irritability, and aggression).

ALL children should receive a formalized ASD screening at their 18- and 24-month well-child visits:\t The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends screening all children for ASD at the 18 and 24-month well-child visits in addition to regular developmental surveillance and screening.  This type of screening can identify children with significant developmental and behavioral challenges early, when they may benefit most from intervention, as well as those with other developmental difficulties. For screening to be effective, it must be applied to all children – not only those with   symptoms .\t There are multiple different tools your provider can choose to screen for ASD. While the AAP does not endorse any specific ASD screening tool over another, here are some your child's provider may use:   Ages and Stages Questionnaires SE-2 (ASQ-SE2) Pervasive Developmental Disorders Screening Test-II (PDDST-II) Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales (CSBS) Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers – Revised with follow-up (M-CHAT-R/F) The M-CHAT-R/F the most common screening tool used in pediatric offices.  It is a 23-point questionnaire filled out by parents. Most families find it easy to fill out. Using this standardized screening tool, pediatricians will be prompted to start conversations about  language delays ,  concerns about behavior, or possible next steps for a child at risk with additional  genetic , neurologic, or developmental testing.\t Screening isn't diagnosing!\t It's important to note that screening isn't  diagnosing .

They should also be referred for early intervention services. Here's what else to expect. A full assessment or diagnostic evaluation for ASD is needed before arriving at a diagnosis. Ideally, this is done by a team of professionals. It includes asking parents and caregivers a number of questions, observing the child, doing a physical examination and requesting various tests. Intervention for ASD consists of several different things. First, your child's pediatrician may prescribe medically necessary therapies such as speech, behavioral, and/or occupational therapy. Although diagnostic evaluations can take some time to arrange, some early intervention services can start without a diagnosis. Starting services through early intervention programs\t If your child is under 3 years old:  They should also be referred to your state's Early Intervention (EI) program. \t If your child is 3 years old or older:  They can be evaluated, and likely enrolled, in your local school district's special education services. \t If your child is between 3 and 5 years old : They may be eligible to attend a developmental preschool program for children in need of more support. Contact your local school district.  Meanwhile, a doctor or psychologist with expertise in diagnosing ASD may make the diagnosis. ASD can also be diagnosed by a team of specialists that might include developmental pediatricians, child neurologists, child psychiatrists, psychologists, speech-language pathologists, occupational or physical therapists, educators and social workers. Typically, a diagnostic evaluation for ASD includes: Careful observation of play and child-caregiver interactions Detailed history and physical examination Review of records of previous early intervention services, school or other evaluations Developmental assessment of all skills (motor, language, social, self-help, cognitive). ASD is suspected when a child's social and language functioning is significantly more impaired than their overall level of motor, adaptive and cognitive skills. Hearing test. All children with any speech/language delays or those suspected of having ASD should have their hearing formally tested. Language evaluation that provides standardized scores of expressive language (including speech and gestures) and receptive language (understanding of others' speech and gestures). This should also include an evaluation of pragmatic language (social use of language) and articulation (pronunciation).               While an ASD diagnosis is based on all the information collected, such as a child's history, observations and tests, these do not have to be completed at the same time. There is value in receiving a diagnosis and continuing to add information to a supports and services plan. Autism may be associated with a known genetic syndrome or medical condition.  Laboratory tests may be called for to evaluate for other possible medical conditions that could cause ASD symptoms. This depends on findings from the child's history and physical examination. If these tests are appropriate, your child may be referred to other specialists, such as a      geneticist  or      pediatric neurologist . Medical tests may include:\t Genetic tests.  It is recommended that families be offered genetic testing, such as chromosomal microarray testing, to help identify potential reasons a child might have ASD. At present, up to 42% of children on the autism spectrum have genetic abnormalities that can be identified through chromosomal microarray testing. Depending on findings from a child's history and physical examination, other types of genetic testing may be recommended to look for specific disorders. Examples include            fragile X syndrome ,            Rett syndrome  or            tuberous sclerosis complex . Genetic testing should be strongly considered if a child has either unusual physical features or developmental delays. Genetic testing may also be recommended if there is a family history intellectual disability of an unknown cause or other genetic disorders.\t Lead test. Lead screening  is an important component of well-child checkups. A child's blood lead level should be tested when they live in a high-risk environment, such as an older building, or continue to put things in their mouth.\t Other tests.  Depending on findings from the child's medical history and physical examination, electroencephalography (EEG), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or tests for metabolic disorders may be requested. Children with ASD may be            picky eaters , so your child's pediatrician may recommend looking for evidence of            iron or vitamin deficiencies  (especially vitamin D deficiency). Medical tests not recommended: There is not enough clinical evidence to recommend any of the following tests specifically for ASD: Hair analysis Routine measurement of multiple vitamin or nutrient levels Intestinal permeability studies Stool analysis Urinary peptide analysis Measurement of mercury or other heavy metals Diagnosing ASD Diagnosis of ASD is made by using all the information collected by history, observation and testing.      See \t   How is Autism Diagnosed? If you have concerns about your child's behavior or development, talk with your pediatrician.\t   Editor's note:  Children with ASD may have other medical problems that may need further evaluation and treatment. These may include seizures, problems with sleep, gastrointestinal problems (feeding problems, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and behavioral health problems (such as anxiety, ADHD, irritability, and aggression).

        "content": "​​​​​​​​By: Susan Hyman, MD, FAAP & Lori McIlwain Anyone who's been a parent long enough has felt that panic—often only temporary—when a child wanders out of sight. Kids can get lost anywhere—at an amusement park, in a store, in a crowd, and sometimes even right in your own neighborhood. Many parents of children with      autism spectrum disorder  (ASD) know this feeling all too well. How common is it for kids on the autism spectrum to wander? The first      study  to quantify the scope of the problem was published in      Pediatrics . Results were significant. Of the 1,218 children with ASD who were studied, almost half of those children had wandered off from home, school or another safe place at least once after age 4. Many were missing long enough to cause concern, were in danger of drowning, or were at risk of being hurt by traffic.  What parents can do to keep their child safe There are things parents can do to protect their c​hildren with ASD from this very real and scary danger.  Here are tips from the American Academy of Pediatrics: \t Know wandering triggers . Children with ASD can be impulsive and typically wander or bolt from a safe setting to get to something of interest, such as water, the park or train tracks. Or, they may run off to get away from a situation they find stressful or frightening, such as one with loud noises, commotion or bright lights.  \t Secure your home—regardless of your child's age . Shut and lock doors that lead outside. Consider putting alarms on doors to alert you if a door has been opened.\t Work on communication and behavior strategies . Teaching your child strategies to self-calm when stressed and appropriately respond to \"no\" can make a big difference. Make sure your child's teachers and other family members understand how important it is to keep your child engaged and busy to reduce their urge or opportunity to wander.\t Set expectations . Before going out in a public place, communicate the plan with your child and other family members—including the timeline and rules to follow. Consider noise-canceling headphones if noise is a trigger, and use the \"tag team\" approach to make certain your child is always supervised by a trusted adult. \t Consider monitoring technology and identification.  More than 1/3 of children with ASD who wander are never or rarely able to communicate their name, address or phone number. It may be helpful to have things like GPS devices, medical alert tags, and even their name marked in clothing.            Project Lifesaver  or other programs may be available through your local law enforcement agencies.\t Rest . Children with ASD may be less hyperactive and less likely to wander during the night if they have a sleep management plan and a            regular sleep schedule . Caregivers who get enough sleep are also more vigilant. Many children with ASD may have sleep problems.  If your child is having problems going to sleep or staying asleep, talk to your pediatrician for further evaluation and treatment.    Drowning is the cause of death for almost 3 in 4 children with autism who wander off alone.\t   Reinforce water and swimming safety. Home swimming pools should be surrounded by a fence that prevents a child from getting to the pool from the house. There is no substitute for at least a four-foot-high, non-climbable, four-sided  fence  with a self-closing, self-latching gate; some states require at least 5 feet.  \t Pool alarms and door alarms are also protection products that may have some benefits. Note, however, that swimming lessons are not enough to  prevent drowning ;                     swimming lessons  in wet clothes and shoes could be suggested for children with ASD who tend to wander.\t The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends a family supervision plan for children with ASD and other special needs. Have a checklist of nearby ponds, lakes and pools to search if a child wanders.                     Download an emergency plan here . \t To find swim lessons, contact your local parks and recreation facility or YMCA. Many communities have free or low-cost programs. Swim programs are tailored to meet cultural, religious, physical and mental health needs. Local faith-based organizations also can offer suggestions on swim accommodations that meet your family’s beliefs and traditions. \t Each state also has an affliate organization of                     Family Voices , a national family-led organization of families of children and youth with special health care needs. They are another resource for finding swim lessons to accomodate your child's needs.  Worried about wandering? Talk with your child's pediatrician about creating a      family wandering emergency plan . Your pediatrician can give you additional strategies that may be helpful in increasing your child's safety, as well as information about local resources.\t Editor's note:  Wandering behavior isn't unique to children with ASD. A variety of different developmental disorders, such as         attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD), can also lead to children running off at any given moment. In addition, c hildren with ASD may have other medical problems that may need further evaluation and treatment.  These may include seizures, problems with sleep, gastrointestinal problems (feeding problems, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and behavioral health problems (such as anxiety, ADHD, irritability and aggression).

        "content": "​​Language development varies widely among children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Some are early talkers and never seem to run out of things to say. Others are naturally quiet and start speaking much later. However, social communication differences are core features of ASD. Many children with ASD will benefit from some form of speech- language therapy to enhance their communication skills.      What is social communication? Some children with ASD face have challenges in communicating their wants and needs. Others may unintentionally be one-sided in their conversations and benefit by working on 2-way communication. Teaching children with ASD to converse with others in social situations, also called pragmatic communication. Pragmatic language involves skills such as picking up on body language, maintaining eye contact, understanding implied meaning, using normal voice inflection and volume when speaking, maintaining the topic of conversation, and recognizing the interest level of others in what is being discussed. The extent of speech-language therapy varies from one child to the next and depends on the needs of the individual. The exact services your child requires are determined after evaluation by a speech-language pathologist, often called a speech-language therapist. Therapy itself may be done individually, in a small-group setting, or in a classroom. However, therapy is most effective when it involves everyone—teachers, support staff, families, and even the child's peers—to encourage the child to practice speech and language skills in a natural setting throughout the day. It's important to think of communication as being more than speech, especially because recent studies show that about 30% of individuals with ASD do not gain the skill of verbal speech.  Beyond verbal speech: augmentive communication Because some children with ASD become frustrated about not being able to verbally communicate their wants and needs, they may benefit from augmentative communication—using gestures, sign language, or picture communi­cation programs. For example, your child may benefit from the Picture Exchange Communication System, a method that uses ABA principles to teach children with less-developed verbal abilities to communicate with pictures.  With guidance from a therapist, teacher, or parent, the child learns how to exchange a picture for an object and eventually learns to use pictures to express thoughts and desires. Eventually, the child learns to create sentences using more than one picture and to answer questions. Introducing augmentative communication to children with ASD who are not yet using verbal communication does not keep them from learning to talk, and there is some evi­dence that they may be more stimulated to learn speech if they already understand something about symbolic communication. Augmentative communication may also include the use of electronic devices or applications, some of which have synthesized speech output.​ ​",

Overall, the long-term outcomes of children with    autism spectrum disorder (ASD)  have been improving. In general,  the sooner ASD is identified , the sooner appropriate intervention programs can begin.

        "content": "Children may come to school or child care as cancer survivors, or they may be      diagnosed with cancer  while enrolled. If children who have cancer are well enough during therapy or between rounds of therapy, they may attend child care or school. What adaptations may be needed? Medications Some children may be on low-dose      antibiotics  to prevent infection, but they are usually given at home. Dietary considerations There usually is no special diet, but children who are recovering from weight loss from      chemotherapy  may be on high-calorie foods or shakes. Physical environment Good hygiene such as hand washing and avoiding infectious diseases. See         Preventing the Spread of Illness in Child Care or School .  Follow any guidance in the child's care plan about physical activity, but usually children who are well enough to attend child care or school will be able to participate in most activities. How teachers can help:  Schedule a meeting with parents/guardians to go over the specifics of the child's condition because each case is unique. Have the child make a brief visit before the first full day returning to child care or school to meet with his teachers and classmates. The child's care plan will probably need to be updated frequently for a child who is still getting cancer treatments. Make sure the child's care plans are updated after each hospitalization or change in therapy. Explain to the other children about the child's condition, especially if the child's appearance has changed. Children sometimes feel guilty that they somehow caused their condition and may need reassurance that this isn't so. Immediately after chemotherapy or radiation, the child may be more tired or need to rest, but that will resolve over a few weeks. The child may have frequent absences for medical tests and treatments. Often child life specialists in the hospital help children adapt and keep up with any lessons they may miss. Benefits of being with peers:   Being with groups of children can provide a routine and the chance to interact with friends, which can be a welcome break from a hospital setting.

        "content": "By: Kathryn S. Sutton, MD, FAAP Childhood cancer is    rare . The    treatment  plan for each child with cancer will depend on the type of cancer and its location in the body. Recently, scientists have developed ways to use the immune system to help treat cancer called targeted therapy or immunotherapy. How can the immune system help treat cancer? The immune system is the body's defense against infection (bacteria and viruses), allergens (like pollen) and cancer cells. Immune cells are called white blood cells. The body learns over time to protect itself by making special white blood cells and proteins called antibodies. When a cancer cell is in the body, white blood cells called Antigen Presenting Cells tell other white blood cells called Helper T cells to activate Killer T cells to destroy it. Helper T cells also activate B cells (another type of white blood cell) to make proteins called antibodies. Antibodies label the surface of the cancer cells so that other white blood cells can find and destroy it.\t Types of immunotherapy Research has found ways to treat cancer by increasing a person's own immune response to cancer cells in their body. This is called  cancer immunotherapy .  Types of cancer immunotherapy include:\t Antibodies.  Just like the antibodies made by the immune system, doctors can give extra antibodies against the cancer cells. The body's normal white blood cells then find and kill the cancer cells.\t Drugs that turn white blood cells on or off.  Medications help to increase the body's immune response against cancer cells.\t Tumor vaccines.  In the same way that vaccines against infections cause the body to make antibodies to a virus or bacteria, tumor vaccines cause the body to make antibodies to cancer cells.\t Cellular therapies.  Giving special white blood cells to the patient that help to treat cancer cells. An example is    CAR T cells . What are CAR T cells? CAR T cells are a type of immunotherapy called cellular therapy. CAR stands for Chimeric Antigen Receptor. CARs are designed by scientists to attach to the surface of a person's white blood cells T cells. Scientists take a patient's own Killer T cells from a blood draw and in the laboratory add a protein receptor that is specific for a cancer cell marker (antigen). This new receptor called a CAR allows the Killer T cell to find and attack the cancer cell. The new T cells are given back to the patient into the vein as cancer treatment. What cancers can CAR T cells treat? CAR T cells have been made to treat many types of cancer, including leukemias (cancers of the white blood cells) and lymphomas (cancers of the lymph nodes), solid tumors (cancers in different parts of the body) and brain tumors. In many cases CAR T cells are still in development or being studied in clinical trials with different success rates.  Do CAR T cells have side effects? CAR T cells can cause side effects. These may include changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and brain function. The side effects are managed in the intensive care unit (ICU) with supportive medications.  CAR T cells for treating different cancers will have different side effects. For example, sometimes CAR T cells make patients prone to infections. Infusions of antibodies (IVIG) and special antimicrobial agents can be given to help fight infection.  Talk with your child's doctor If you or your child has cancer, you can talk with their  oncologist  (a doctor that treats cancer) to find out if CAR T cell therapy is the right treatment for the cancer.\t    More information Common Pediatric Cancer Treatments Explained About Dr. Sutton\t   Kathryn S.

        "content": "By: Mary Jane S. Hogan, MD, MPH, FAAP & Melissa M. Hudson, MD, FAAP Completing treatment for childhood cancer can bring a range of emotions. In addition to feeling of relief about no more chemotherapy, the child and family may worry that the cancer will return. Adjusting to a new routine with fewer visits to the doctor can also be stressful.  After cancer treatment is completed, your child will continue to be checked by a pediatric oncology doctor at regularly scheduled follow up visits. Here is what to expect during follow-up care, and some common questions families of childhood cancer survivors may have. What happens at my child's follow-up visits after cancer treatment? After the end of cancer treatment, follow-up visits typically include testing to make sure the cancer has not returned. In addition, persistent side effects from cancer treatment are monitored and supportive care given. As more time passes after therapy is completed, follow up visits increasingly focus on monitoring for and treating delayed effects of cancer treatment. Different cancers require different treatments for cure. Both the type of cancer and its treatment often impact the long-term overall health of the cancer survivor and family. Long-term follow up health care after cancer treatment is highly recommended to monitor for these possible persistent and late onset health issues, so they can be treated accordingly. To help guide health care providers to provide appropriate care for each child, your child will need a cancer treatment summary and survivorship care plan. What is a cancer treatment summary and survivorship care plan?\t A treatment summary  is a written, short story about the treatment a child received for cancer. It includes:  Type of cancer and date of diagnosis Title of the treatment protocol used Names and dates of surgery, medication doses and/or radiation therapy received Reports of the tumor biopsy, special blood or tissue testing, and imaging results Side effects or problems experienced  Supportive or palliative care received, such as counseling or physical therapy Names and contact information of your child's cancer care team\t A survivorship care plan  is a written follow-up care plan just for your child which includes the treatment summary and the following: When to test and how to care for possible long-term and late effects affecting the body When and how to get emotional, social, and spiritual support or counseling if needed When to test and how to get help for possible learning or school issues Information for health insurance and other financial support if needed Appointments with other special doctors, educators, and therapists if needed Suggestions for healthy behaviors, nutrition (healthy food), and physical exercise Will my child have any lingering side effects from their cancer treatments? During the first year after completing cancer treatment, many side effects or problems that happened during treatment will go away or improve. A side effect that does not improve is called a long-term side effect. Some long-term side effects may take months or years to go away. Other side effects may not occur until months or even years after treatment. A side effect that develops months to years after completing cancer treatment is called a late effect.  Some effects are very mild while others cause noticeable health problems. Some children have many long-term or late effects, while others have none or few. Different cancer treatments can result in different    late effects of treatment for childhood cancer . Your child's survivorship care plan will list the possible long-term or late effects that they may face, and how your doctor may test for these issues. Types of possible long-term and late effects  Depending on the cancer and cancer treatment possible problems may arise with: Certain body parts such as the heart, lung, kidney, or gastrointestinal tract (throat, stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas) Certain hormones that control growth, pubertal development, or energy The nervous system causing pain, numbness, or tingling in the hands, feet, or other body parts Sensory functions resulting in hearing loss, vision changes, dry eyes, or dry mouth Recovery of the immune system making it hard to fight infection New or second cancers Emotions or feelings such as depression or anxiety Behavior such as difficulty sleeping or difficulty interacting with friends or family Memory, learning (handwriting, spelling, reading, math), or thinking (paying attention, doing work on time, solving problems, planning) What can I do to help my child? To avoid being overwhelmed by possible long-term or late effects, ask your child's doctor what to expect during your child's recovery from cancer treatment.  Knowing what possible symptoms to be aware of and when they may occur can help you care for your child.  Every year, bring your child's cancer treatment summary and survivorship care plan to their primary care doctor or survivorship clinic to help provide the best care for your child. What is a childhood cancer survivorship clinic? Two years after cancer treatment has ended, your child may be referred to a special childhood cancer survivorship clinic to be checked for any possible long-term and late effects from the treatment. If your hospital does not have such a clinic, ask your child's doctor to suggest one or find one at the Children's Oncology Group website, which has a    Late Effects Directory of Services . At this clinic, you will get a written copy of your child's cancer treatment summary and a survivorship care plan (see above) that tells doctors what possible problems to look for. These clinics combine the help of special doctors to watch for possible health problems that could continue or occur years after cancer treatment has ended. By finding and caring for these possible problems early, doctors can keep your child healthy.

        "content": "By: Vikramjit Kanwar, MD, FAAP A diagnosis of cancer is alarming and often unfamiliar for both children and their parents. Fortunately, survival rates for childhood cancer have increased dramatically in recent decades. Today, more than    80%  children diagnosed with cancer in the United States who are treated will be cured.  In this article, the American Academy of Pediatrics offers information on some of the common treatment options available. Keep in mind that not all of these treatments are recommended for every cancer type or in every child.  What is a cancer treatment plan? After diagnosis, a doctor specializing in childhood cancer called a    pediatric oncologist  will work with the family and other cancer subspecialists to put together a treatment plan or \"protocol.\"  A child's cancer treatment plan may include a combination of: surgery to remove cancerous tissue chemotherapy (also known as drug therapy) radiation therapy (high energy X-rays) targeted therapy, such as immunotherapy (proteins that cause the immune system to kill cancer or that target specific cancer genes or proteins) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (strong chemotherapy followed by replacement with new marrow blood cells) What's included in a treatment plan depends on the    type of cancer , the cancer's genetics, and where the cancer is located in the body. Surgery Surgery may play a role in both cancer diagnosis and treatment, especially for solid tumors and lymphomas (lymph nodes that contain cancer). The surgeon may first take out a piece of the tumor, a procedure called a    biopsy , so the tissue can be tested. This can reveal the exact type of cancer.  Surgeons may then remove as much of the cancer as possible before, during, or after other treatments are given that shrink the tumor for the best possible outcomes.  Sometimes surgery can damage the healthy tissue surrounding the tumor. A child may need supportive medication or care to help them heal from the surgery.  What surgery treats Surgery is often part of treatment for solid tumors in the kidney (such as Wilms tumor), nervous system (such as neuroblastoma), bone, muscle or other soft tissue (types of sarcomas), and brain cancers, for example.\t   Childhood cancer treatment & clinical trials\t More than half of children being treated for cancer are enrolled in  clinical trials . Clinical trials are research studies that help doctors learn improve cure rates and the quality of life during and after cancer treatment. They're good for patients, too.  Patients in clinical trials get the latest information, testing, procedures, chemotherapy and other drugs. A pediatric oncologist will go over the risks and benefits of the clinical trial to help families decide if a clinical trial is a good option for their child. \t  Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses high energy X-rays (photons or protons) to kill cancer cells. Radiation is delivered by a machine called a linear accelerator, which sends high energy X-rays directly into the cancer. Radiation is not seen, tasted, or smelled, but the linear accelerator sometimes makes a clicking or humming noise during treatment.  Each radiation treatment can last 10-30 minutes, and may be given daily, for several days a week. Total treatment can last from 1-8 weeks, depending on the type of cancer. Sometimes radiation can temporarily damage healthy tissue around the tumor being treated. Side effects, which often depend on the type and location of the cancer, may arise two- to three weeks after starting treatment and last for several weeks. Supportive medications are given to reduce many side effects. What radiation therapy treats  Radiation therapy may be part of treatment for childhood cancers that develop in soft tissue (rhabdomyosarcoma and sarcoma), the bones (Ewing Sarcoma), eye (retinoblastoma), lymph nodes (Hodgkin lymphoma) and nervous system (neuroblastoma, ependymoma, pontine glioma and astrocytoma), among other types. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy (sometimes called \"chemo\") is the use of medicines to help kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy can be given in a number of different ways: by mouth (orally) in the vein (intravenously) into a muscle (intramuscularly) into the spinal fluid (intrathecally or intraventricularly) under the skin (subcutaneously).  Often, a combination of chemotherapy drugs are used together. The length of treatment depends on the type of cancer and how quickly the cancer responds. As with radiation, sometimes healthy cells in the body are affected, too—especially fast-growing ones like those in the blood, intestines and hair follicles—but the damage is usually temporary. Each chemotherapy has unique side effects but there are supportive medications available to reduce them.  What chemotherapy treats Chemotherapy is often part of treatment for most types of cancer that start in the kidney, nervous system, ovaries or testes (germ cells in the ovaries or testes), muscle, bones (Ewing Sarcoma, osteosarcoma), liver (hepatoblastoma), eye (retinoblastoma), blood, lymph nodes (both Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma), immune system (Langerhans cell histiocytosis) and brain.  Hematopoietic stem cell & bone marrow transplant Stem cell transplants replace diseased or damaged bone marrow cells with healthy stem cells from bone marrow or    umbilical cord blood  that can make healthy, new mature blood cells. There are two main types of bone marrow transplants used to treat childhood cancers:\t Autologous transplant.  This type of transplant collects or \"harvests\" the child's own stem cells and freezes them for later use. It starts with very high doses of chemotherapy to destroy cancer cells. After chemotherapy, a stimulant protein is given daily to force stem cells out from the bone marrow. The cells are then collected using a special machine in a process called apheresis, which separates blood into its different parts. The frozen stem cells are then thawed and put back or \"infused\" into the patient's bloodstream. These healthy stem cells travel to the healthy marrow to grow healthy blood cells.\t Allogeneic transplant.  This type of transplant collects stem cells from another person, often a brother or sister. If a family donor is not a genetic match, families can look for an unrelated donor through the    National Marrow Donor Program . Patients may also receive donated umbilical cord blood. Before donated stem cells are transplanted, chemotherapy with or without radiation (called    conditioning ) is used to destroy the patient's bone marrow. The new donated stem cells are infused into the bloodstream to produce new blood cells. Since patients are vulnerable to infection and many other side effects during stem cell transplants, they usually need to stay in the hospital for a while. A hospital stay also helps doctors watch closely for any complications, such as the body rejecting the transplanted cells.  What stem cell transplant treats Stem cell transplant may be used to treat children with high-risk neuroblastoma and certain types of brain tumors, lymphomas, germ cell tumors, and leukemia that have relapsed (returned) after earlier treatment.  Targeted therapy Targeted therapy, sometimes called molecular therapy or precision medicine, works by targeting and destroying the cancer's specific mutated (changed) genes, proteins or surrounding tissue. Targeted therapy may be used in combination with other treatments such as chemotherapy.  Major types of targeted therapy There are different types of targeted cancer therapies. The two major types include small molecule drugs that work inside cancer cells, and monoclonal antibodies that attach to the outside of cancer cells. Some mark cancer cells so that they are better seen and killed by the immune system. Others kill or stop cancer cells from growing. Still others carry toxins to cancer cells or target a specific genetic defect in the tumor. Although the hope of targeted therapy is to reduce any side effects to healthy tissue, even targeted therapy has side effects that are manageable with supportive medication and care from the pediatric oncologist. What targeted therapy treats Targeted therapy so far has been most successful with some types of leukemia and lymphoma. As research leads to a better understanding of various genetic abnormalities in different types of childhood cancers, others may also be treated with different targeted therapies.  Immunotherapy Immunotherapy treatment involves using medications to help the body's own germ-fighting immune system to target and destroy cancer cells. There are different types of immunotherapy that can treat cancer, including:\t Monoclonal antibody treatmen t, which uses specific antibodies made by the immune system to bind to specific protein markers on tumor cells. This helps the immune system recognize and destroy them.  \t Immune checkpoint inhibitors  are a newer class of drug that turn off the protective function of proteins that are produced by cancer cells previously missed in the immune system's attack.  \t Adoptive cell therapy, also called T-cell transfer therapy , is when T cells (a type of lymphocyte or white blood cell) are collected from a patient and grown in a laboratory under conditions that \"trains\" them to fight cancer cells. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T cell) therapy is the best-known of this type of cell therapy.  CAR T-cell therapy  has many initial, severe side effects but can be highly effective against relapsed leukemia or lymphoma.\t Cancer vaccines , available in clinical trials, helps the immune system to identify and destroy cancer cells.  As with other types of targeted therapy, immunotherapy also has side effects that can happen during and even after the treatment. Careful monitoring and supportive medical care help to reduce these side effects. What immunotherapy treats Immunotherapy may be part of the treatment plan many different types of cancers, including Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, skin cancer (melanoma), high risk or relapsed leukemia or neurblastoma that has spread to other parts of the body. Remember Starting cancer treatment can be a confusing time for patients and their families. Talk with your pediatrician and cancer team if you have any questions about the best treatment plan for your child.

        "content": "​    ​​​By:Vikramjit Kanwar, MD, FAAP ​ Childhood  cancer​  is rare, and more readily diagnosed and treated than ever. With better testing to tell between the specific types of cancers and better cancer treatments available, more than 80% of children and adolescents with cancer will survive.      Signs and symptoms of cancer often mimic other illnesses. Pediatricians concerned about a possible cancer will refer your child to a      pediatric oncologist , a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating childhood cancers. The specialist will need to get a thorough medical, social, and family history, as well as a physical examination. They may also order different tests to determine the different types of cancers.  What are some common tests used to diagnose cancer?  Below are some of the more common tests used to diagnose cancer in children and teens. Not all of the tests mentioned here are necessary to diagnose every cancer.\t Blood tests  help look for cancer in the blood or determine the damage to tissues in the body caused by cancer. A sample of blood is obtained by temporarily inserting a sterile needle into a vein of cleaned skin. The sample of blood is sent to special laboratories and results may take several minutes or up to weeks to return. Examples of common blood tests include:\t Complete blood count (CBC)  examines the number of red blood cells which carry oxygen to the body, the number and type of white blood cells that fight infection, and the number of platelets that help the blood to clot. Sometimes this test will show leukemia cells, which are cancerous, abnormal white blood cells that do not fight infection.\t Complete metabolic or chemistry panel  shows how well the liver and kidney are working and whether there are abnormal chemical substances from cancer cells breaking down.\t Tumor biomarkers  are special substances that certain types of cancers secrete into the bloodstream. Different tumor biomarkers help to determine different types of cancers and help determine whether a cancer still exists during or after treatment.\t Urine tests.  Urine tests help look for kidney and/or bladder damage from cancer cells or tumor biomarkers, special substances that certain cancers secrete into the urine. A sample of urine is obtained by having a child urinate into a special plastic container or bag. The urine sample is sent to special laboratories and results may take minutes to days to return.\t Imaging studies  help look for cancer in and around normal tissues in the body. Different kinds of pictures are made from different machines using different techniques to look at different parts of the body. A special technician is needed to take the picture of the cancerous tissue in the affected body part that is held still for a given amount of time. Examples of common imaging studies include:\t Plain radiography or X-rays  use ionizing radiation in one direction, for a few seconds like a camera to make a picture of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and/or bones.\t Ultrasonography or ultrasound  use sound waves with a wand placed on moisturized skin, for several minutes, to make a picture of the skin, and soft tissues of the neck, breast, abdomen, and/or pelvis.\t Computerized tomography or CT scans  use ionizing radiation from a noisy, donut-shaped machine moving along a child who is lying down for several minutes, to make a three-dimensional picture of any part of the body (brain, head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, spine, arms, and/or legs). Sometimes special dye is injected into the bloodstream before the scan to better tell normal tissue from cancer.\t Magnetic Resonance Imaging or  MRI scans  use magnetic fields from a noisy, tube-shaped machine in which the child lies still for several minutes, to make a three-dimension picture of any part of the body (brain, head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, spine, arms, and/or legs). Special dye is injected before the MRI scan to better tell normal tissue from cancer.\t Positron Emission Tomography or PET scans  require injection of a mildly radioactive special dye into the bloodstream which goes to very actively dividing cells (including cancers). The ionizing radiation is detected by a noisy, donut-shaped scanning machine moving along a child who is lying down still for several minutes. This may be combined with a CT scan to create a three-dimensional picture of the entire body that allows cancer to be better distinguished from normal tissue.\t Bone scans  involve injection of a temporary radioactive substance that has charged particles, into the blood stream, which only goes to inflamed, damaged or abnormal bone, which is detected by a special scanning machine that takes a picture of the body and helps to better tell normal bone from cancer.\t Meta-iodobenzylguanidine or MIBG scans  require an injection of a temporary radioactive substance into the blood stream, which is only taken up by some cancers involving nerve tissue such as pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma. This is detected by a special scanner that creates a picture of the body, allowing cancer to be distinguished from normal tissue.\t Tumor sampling studies  may include:\t Tumor biopsy​ .    After a child is given anesthesia or sedation, which causes temporary sleep and relieves any         pain , a surgeon operates on the part of the child's body where the tumor is located. After removing the cancerous tissue, the surgeon closes the wound with special stitches called sutures, a gauze dressing is applied, and a child is woken up. Sometimes the cancer tissue can be sampled using a needle. If cancer is present in a lymph node, one of hundreds of glands that provide infection-fighting fluid throughout the body, the abnormal node also can be removed with surgery or sampled with a needle.   The cancer tissue sample or lymph node sample is sent to a pathologist, a doctor who examines the tissue microscopically to determine the specific type of cancer. Other tests may be done that include flow cytometry to look for abnormal protein markers on the surface of cancer cells, or special genetic testing to look for tumor biomarkers and mutations in the DNA that determine the sub-type of cancer.\t Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy tests  for cancer in the marrow, the core part of the bone where red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are made. The child is given anesthesia and a sterile needle is temporarily inserted into the rear pelvic bone to remove a small sample of the liquid marrow. In addition, a small piece of solid marrow (about the size of an inch-long string) is also removed. After the needle is removed, a gauze dressing is applied to the skin puncture site. The area may feel sore for a day or two. The bone marrow samples are sent for special microscope testing to look for any cancer cells; cytogenetic testing to look for any abnormal chromosomes found in cancer cells; flow cytometry to look for abnormal protein markers on the surface of cancer cells; and/or special genetic testing with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to look for abnormal DNA in cancer cells.        \t Lumbar puncture tests   for cancer in the cerebrospinal fluid, the special liquid around the brain and spinal cord that keeps the central nervous system healthy. The child is given anesthesia and a sterile needle is temporarily inserted into the skin, between the 2 bones of the lower back or lumbar vertebrae into the spinal column where the spinal fluid flows. The spinal fluid drips from the needle into special containers. After the needle is removed, a gauze dressing is applied to the skin puncture site. To avoid a headache, the child lies flat for at least 30 minutes afterwards.  ​The cerebrospinal fluid is sent for special microscopic testing to look for cancer cells. It may also be sent for special chemistry testing looking for tumor biomarkers, and/or flow cytometry testing to look for abnormal proteins on the surface of cancer cells.​ Which tests are used for which types of cancers? Here are four basic categories of cancers which have many cancer sub-types within each category. Different sub-types of cancers require different specialized tests.\t Leukemia  is the growth of abnormal white blood cells in the bone marrow (soft core of the bones) and bloodstream. Common tests used to diagnose leukemia include: Blood tests such as complete blood count and complete metabolic panel Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and lumbar puncture\t Lymphoma  is the growth of abnormal white blood cells in the lymph nodes. Common tests used to diagnose lymphoma include: Blood tests such complete blood count and complete metabolic panel Imaging studies such as X-ray, CT scan, MRI scan and/or PET scan Tumor biopsy such as lymph node biopsy, and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and lumbar puncture\t Brain and spine tumors  are the growth of abnormal nerve tissue or abnormal nerve-supporting tissue in the brain and/or spinal cord also known as the central nervous system (CNS). Common tests used to diagnose CNS tumors include: Imaging studies such as CT scan, MRI scan, and sometimes Bone scan Tumor biopsy by a neurosurgeon (brain surgeon) Lumbar puncture \t Solid tumors  are cancerous growths of abnormal tissues that are not in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, brain or spinal cord. Some examples of different solid tumors include neuroblastoma (cancer of the adrenal gland), Wilms tumor (cancer of the kidney), rhabdomyosarcoma (cancer of the muscle), osteosarcoma (cancer of the bone), Ewing sarcoma (cancer of the bone), hepatoblastoma (cancer of the liver), and germ cell tumor (cancer of the ovaries or testes). Blood tests such as complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and tumor biomarkers Urine tests for tumor biomarkers Imaging studies such as X-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, PET scan, Bone scan, and/or MIBG scan Tumor biopsy such as cancer tissue biopsy, lymph node biopsy, and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy More information\t Types of Childhood and Adolescent Cancer When a Child or Adolescent is Diagnosed with Cancer: Words of Support for Parents​ About the Author\t Vikramjit Kanwar, MD, FAAP, is a Corresponding Fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Hematology and Oncology.

        "content": "By: Roger L. Berkow, MD, FAAP & Elaine Morgan, MD, FAAP Neutropenia is a term that means the body is low on a type of white blood cells called neutrophils. Neutrophils fight infection caused by bacteria, fungi and parasites. Having fewer neutrophils than normal can make a child more prone to get certain kinds of infections. If your child has neutropenia, it's important to work closely with their doctor and take steps to keep them healthy. Here are answers to some common questions families may have about neutropenia. How is neutropenia diagnosed? Neutropenia is detected with a blood test called a complete blood count (CBC). This test counts the blood cells including the different types of white blood cells.  Neutropenia is classified as mild, moderate, severe or very severe. The classification is based on the number of neutrophils from a blood test. The lower the number of neutrophils, the greater is the risk of serious infection. What causes neutropenia? Neutropenia may be caused by certain medications, chemicals, nutrient deficiencies, other illnesses or infections. Neutropenia can also develop when neutrophils are destroyed by the body's immune system. Sometimes, neutropenia can happen after replacement of the normal bone marrow by cells that do not belong there. While this is a less common cause of neutropenia, it may signal a more serious disease. More rarely, neutropenia may be a result of a condition which a child is born with, called inherited or congenital neutropenia. In some children with neutropenia, a specific cause is not identified. What treatment helps a child with neutropenia? Most children who have neutropenia that is not inherited only have the condition for a few months. The neutropenia goes away after the cause is addressed. Examples include treating an infection, stopping a medication, replacing a missing vitamin or mineral or treating the illness that is causing the neutropenia. Some rare inherited causes of neutropenia may result in severe infections or other abnormalities in the bone marrow. Inherited types of neutropenia need to be evaluated by a  pediatric hematologist . If neutropenia is severe for a long time, the doctor may prescribe an injectable medication that can stimulate the bone marrow to make more neutrophils. This would be after a medical workup to determine the cause. What kind of tests can help find the cause of neutropenia?  If your child's doctor is concerned about the neutropenia's severity, they may recommend a    bone marrow test . This test involves looking at the neutrophils in the bone marrow under a microscope. It can evaluate for    leukemia  or other types of bone marrow problems. This type of test is especially important if there are abnormal or a low number of different cell types in the blood. Other tests may be recommended to: monitor patterns in the neutropenia  measure immune function  check for nutritional problems  look for inherited or non-inherited genetic types of neutropenia What to watch for if your child has neutropenia Fever Seek prompt medical care whenever your child has an elevated temperature. Your child's health care provider may order a CBC to check your child's neutrophil count when they have the fever, a condition called febrile neutropenia. They may also want to order a blood culture test to check for causes of infection. Culture tests to check for germs in other locations such as the urine or the throat, may also be needed. Fortunately, common viral infections like    colds  are usually not a significant risk in children with neutropenia and usually do not require specific treatment. Treatment of the febrile neutropenic patient should be determined by the primary treating team. Based on your child's neutrophil count at the time of the fever, your child may be given intravenous (IV) antibiotics. They may also be    admitted to the hospital . Mouth sores Mouth ulcers (sores) can be common in children with severe neutropenia. That makes good oral hygiene extra important. Brush teeth with a soft bristle toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste twice daily. In older children who can swish liquids in their mouth and spit, mouth rinses with salt water or sodium bicarbonate water twice daily can be helpful. Broken skin Any area on the body with skin breakdown (especially in the genital and rectal area) or redness need medical attention. Ongoing attention to skin care, including gentle cleansing with soap and water, also is important. Remember By working with your child's health care team, you can help protect your child from infections. About Dr. Berkow\t Roger L.

        "content": "​​​​​By: Christina Boull, MD, FAAD, FAAP  Skin cancer is rare in children. However, following    safe-sun practices  is the best way to protect children from developing skin cancer later in life.  For adults, it's a good idea to get regular skin-cancer screenings beginning as early as their 20s. Most children do not need regular skin exams by a dermatologist to monitor for skin cancer unless they have certain risk factors. As a parent, here's what you should know about skin cancer.  Types of skin cancer\t Melanoma\t Early detection of melanoma is important, since this type of skin cancer can quickly spread to anywhere in the body. It can even develop on sun-protected skin.  Melanoma can look like a growing or bleeding pink bump that doesn't go away. It can also look like a brown mole that is changing in shape, color, size, or feel.  (See image at right). Non-melanoma skin cancer Children who are immunosuppressed, meaning their body's defense systems are weakened by certain illnesses, medications, or treatments, are more likely to develop these skin cancers. This may look like a small sore, but will last for more than 8 weeks. \t Basal cell carcinoma:  Pearly pink bump, scaly spot, or non-healing sore\t Squamous cell carcinoma:  Scaly pink spot, bump, or non-healing sore\t   Squamous cell carcinoma\t Basal cell carcinoma  Identifying a skin cancer  Skin cancers can appear as pink, growing, or bleeding bumps on previously normal skin. It is normal for children and teens to develop new moles over time. New moles should not continue to grow rapidly or change once they appear. Unexplained bumps that don't go away and non-healing sores that last longer than 8 weeks should be evaluated for skin cancer.    The ABCDE's of concerning moles or spots These features can be a sign of melanoma\t Asymmetry:  One side of a mole is different than the other side\t Border:  Irregular or poorly defined edges\t Color:  Multiple colors within one mole, pink or red spots instead of brown, or an existing mole that is changing colors\t Diameter:  Larger than ¼ inch (a pencil eraser) increases risk, but some skin cancers are smaller if found early. This is the least important factor. Some birthmarks (congenital moles) may be larger than this, but do not necessarily have a higher risk of skin cancer. \t Evolving:  A mole or lesion that looks different from the others, different than it had previously, or is bleeding, itching, or crusting. Moles that are growing rapidly are worrisome. Taking photos can be a helpful way to monitor moles over time.  Risk factors for skin cancer    Hereditary cancer syndromes Genetic syndromes that increase sun sensitivity Suppressed immune system: organ or stem cell transplant, chemotherapy or certain medications History of skin cancer History of  radiation therapy​ History of multiple sunburns  Family history of melanoma in a parent or sibling Medications that make skin easier to damage or burn  Children with these risk factors should talk with their doctor about having a skin exam and consider seeing a dermatologist.  Skin cancer treatment  Many factors are involved with choosing a skin cancer treatment, including type of cancer, size of cancer, and body location. Treatments may include: Creams that activate the immune system (imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil) Procedures that scrape, burn, or surgically remove the skin cancer Oral or intravenous chemotherapy medications Combination of the above  Your dermatologist will help determine what type of treatment is best for your child's skin cancer. Preventing skin cancer means preventing sun damage Luckily, most skin cancers are preventable. Early sun exposure and sunburns are an important risk factor for developing skin cancer. There are many ways to    protect your child  from the radiation from the sun:   Seek shade. Avoid outdoor activities during midday hours (10am to 2pm) when the sun is the most intense Wear a hat with a wide brim that goes all the way around. This protects the scalp, face, ears, and the back of the neck.  Wear long sleeve shirts, full-length pants and sun-protective clothing with ultraviolet protection factor (UPF)* Wear rash guards (swim shirts) at the pool/beach Wear  sunglasses​ .  Apply  sunscreen ​ with S​PF 30 or higher every two hours, more often when swimming or sweating. For children, those containing zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are safe and effective. Avoid    tanning beds . Rays from tanning beds are even more harmful than those from the sun. Getting a \"base tan\" is not safe or protective.

        "content": "By: Stephanie Savelli, MD, FAAP & Pinki Prasad, MD, FAAP Childhood cancer is rare. For children born in the United States, 1 in 285 will be      diagnosed with cancer  before they reach age 20.  Advances in treatment have increased survival for many children. However, cancer remains the second leading cause of death in children ages      1 to 14 , after unintentional injuries.  What are the most common cancers in children and adolescents? Overall for children and adolescents (ages 0 to 19) in the United States, the most common types of cancers are      leukemias , which are cancers of the blood or bone marrow cells; brain and      central nervous system  tumors, including cancers of the spine; and      lymphomas , which are cancers of the lymph nodes or glands). However, the types of cancer can vary by age. \t   Leukemia Leukemia, a cancer of the bone marrow cells, is the of the most common types of childhood cancers. The bone marrow is the core or soft center of the long bones of the body where white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets are produced. White blood cells (called leukocytes) help fight against infection. Red blood cells carry oxygen for the body. Platelets help the body stop bleeding when it is injured. In children with leukemia, the bone marrow produces a lot of abnormal, immature white cells that are unable to fight      infection . Eventually these leukemia cells crowd out the healthy white blood cells, allowing viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms to infect the body and make a person sick. Leukemia cells also crowd out the red blood cells and platelets, making it hard for the body to get enough oxygen and stop bleeding after an injury.\t Types of leukemia include:\t Acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL)  – Roughly three-quarters of all childhood leukemias are ALL, which involves abnormal growth of a type of immature white blood cell called lymphoblasts.\t Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)  - Abnormal growth of another type of white blood cell called myeloblasts and monoblasts. Because leukemia cells leave the bone marrow and enter the bloodstream, which goes everywhere in the body, leukemia is a systemic disease. Leukemia can spread to blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord, the testicles, the ovaries, the kidneys and other organs.  Lymphoma Lymphoma is a cancer of the immune system, affecting lymphoid tissues (lymph nodes and other glands through the body, like the tonsils or thymus). Lymphoma cells, abnormal, immature white blood cells that can't fight infection, end up crowding out the normal lymphoid tissue. This leaves the nodes or glands unable to defend the body against foreign invaders like viruses.  Lymphoma cells can also be found in the bone marrow and other organs of the body such as the liver or the spleen. Lymphoma can cause different symptoms, depending on where the cancer is.\t Types of lymphomas include:\t Hodgkin disease (or Hodgkin lymphoma)  - Usually presents and progresses with gradual, persistent signs and symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and weight loss. The different               subtypes  of this lymphoma are treated in different ways. More common in adolescents.     \t Non-Hodgkin lymphoma  - Signs and symptoms depend on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but usually appear and progress more rapidly than Hodgkin lymphoma.   The three major types are called lymphoblastic lymphoma, mature B-cell lymphoma, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The different subtypes are treated in different ways. Brain cancers (and other central nervous system cancers) There are many types of brain and spinal tumors or cancers of the central nervous system, and the treatments are different. Brain and spine cancers arise from an abnormal growth of immature nerve or supportive cells in in the brain or spine.  These abnormal cells take up space in the brain or spinal cord and can disrupt normal movement, sensation, thought and/or behavior.\t There are four common groups of childhood and adolescent brain cancers or tumors depending on the types of cancer cells involved.  \t Astrocytomas  - Arise from astrocytes or supportive tissue of the brain. They may be either low-grade which grow slowly and rarely spread to other parts of the brain, or high-grade which are more aggressive and can spread to other parts of the brain and the spinal cord.\t Primitive neuroectodermal tumors  - Arise from primitive nerve cells and are more common in children than in adolescents. \t Brain-stem gliomas  - Arise in the bundle of nerve tissue at the base of the brain, where crucial functions such as heart rate, breathing, and swallowing are controlled\t Ependymomas  - Usually arise in the lining of the brain's ventricles, the four connected pockets within the brain. The ventricles produce the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds and cushions the brain and the spinal cord. If an ependymoma is present, the fluid often sends the cancer cells around the brain and spine. Rhabdomyosarcoma Rhabdomyosarcoma is a cancer from abnormal growth of immature muscle cells. This can cause swelling, which may or not be painful, and interfere with normal body function as it grows in the head and neck, groin, abdomen, pelvis, or in the arm or leg. When rhabdomyosarcoma spreads, it typically goes to the lymph nodes, bone, bone marrow, or lung.\t There are two main types of pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma:  \t Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma  - Is more likely seen in teenagers and involves most commonly large muscles of the trunk, arms, and legs (but can be seen in other places as well)\t Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma  - Is more common in infants and young children and occurs most commonly in the head and neck, bladder, prostate, testicles, and vagina Neuroblastoma Neuroblastoma is a cancer that starts with abnormal growth of immature nerve cells, most often arising in the adrenal gland (an organ that makes hormones, located outside the kidneys). It can also form in nerve tissue along the spine near the neck, chest or abdomen. These abnormal cells can disrupt the normal function of the affected body areas and can spread to the skin, bone marrow, bones, lymph nodes, and liver. Nephroblastoma (Wilms Tumor) Wilms tumor, or nephroblastoma, is the most common type of pediatric renal (kidney) cancer.  It most often affects children between 2 and 5 years old. This cancer arises from an abnormal growth of immature kidney cells, often causing a mass on the child's abdomen and disrupting kidney function. This cancer can spread to the lungs, liver, bone, brain or lymph nodes. Thyroid cancer  Thyroid carcinoma (cancer) is an abnormal growth of immature thyroid tissue, developing as a lump or lumps in the butterfly-shaped gland in the middle of the neck. This cancer disrupts the normal hormone production of the thyroid, which controls metabolism, hart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature.  Thyroid cancer can spread into areas of the neck or to lymph nodes, lungs, bone, or sometimes the brain. Bone Cancer  Primary bone cancers (cancers that start in the bones) occur most often in older children and teens, but they can develop at any age. These cancers form painful lumps on the bone(s), interfering with normal bone growth and stability. Primary bone cancers may spread to the lungs, as well as to other bones and soft tissue.  Primary bone cancer is different from metastatic bone cancer, which is abnormal growth of immature cells from non-bone cells elsewhere in the body that then spread to the bones. \t Two main types of primary bone cancers occur in children:\t Osteosarcoma  - Often arises during the growth spurt of puberty and about half of these bone cancers develop in the region of the knee.  \t Ewing sarcoma  - Is a less common type of bone cancer which occurs most commonly in the pelvic (hip) bones, ribs, shoulder blades, and upper legs and arms. Germ Cell & Gonadal Tumors Germ cell tumors come from an abnormal growth of immature cells that would normally develop into the reproductive eggs in girls and sperm in boys. Roughly 90% of germ cell tumors begin in the reproductive cells of the gonads (testes or ovaries), leading to lumps or abnormal hormonal changes. Some of these cancer growths can arise as lumps in the abdomen, brain, or chest. These can spread to the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and brain.  What causes childhood and adolescent cancer?\t The causes of most childhood and adolescent cancers are largely unknown. The cancers that children and teenagers get are not considered preventable or contagious.  A small number of childhood cancers can be related to Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), or other inherited genetic abnormalities called mutations. Rarely, exposure to excessive radiation or environmental chemicals have been associated with childhood cancer but these risk factors are too difficult to confirm. Have the treatments and survival rates for childhood and adolescent cancer improved? Prompt and thorough evaluation for the type of cancer is important, because different types of cancers are treated differently. Childhood and adolescent cancers are usually treated at a children's hospital by doctors specializing in pediatric cancers. These doctors are pediatric oncologists.    With better testing to determine the specific types of cancers and better treatments available, cancers of childhood and adolescents are more      curable  today than in the past.  Overall survival rates in childhood and adolescent cancer are now approaching up to 90% for many cancer types  as a result of participation in      clinical trials  and specialized medical care at pediatric and adolescent cancer centers.

        "content": "By: R obert \t Hayashi, MD, FAAP & A nn Marie Mojica, MD, FAAP Vaccines are made of weak or dead viruses or bacteria that give our immune system key information to resist disease. When vaccines enter the body, our bodies respond by boosting production of of proteins called antibodies. These antibodies help protect against infection. \t     What is immu​​nosuppre​ssive therapy? Certain types of medical t​reatment called immunosuppressive therapy can weaken the body's ability to protect against infection. Examples include chemotherapy, corticosteroids, immunotherapy and radiation therapy. Children and teens may receive immunosuppressive therapy as part of their      cancer treatment . Kids may also need immunosuppressive therapy after a bone marrow (hematopoietic stem cell) transplant, or for treatment of other health conditions such as autoimmune disease,      asthma  and inflammatory bowel disease.  Even if a child was immunized or vaccinated prior to the immunosuppressive therapy for their health condition, there is often a need to repeat immunizations to provide protection. When should my child get their vaccines after immunosuppressive therapy? Your child's pediatric specialty doctor will work together with their pediatrician to decide when vaccines are necessary. Up-to-date guidelines for immunization following the end of immunosuppressive therapy can change over time, so it is important to speak with the doctors treating your child. In general, though, immunization with vaccines starts 6-12 months after the end of immunosuppressive therapy. This gives your child's immune system a chance to recover so it can respond to the vaccine by making protective antibodies. Getting the vaccines too early may lead to a poor response to the vaccine. However, delayed immunization with vaccines may put a child at risk for infections.  Is it OK to get some vaccines before or during immunosuppressive therapy? Some vaccines may be recommended before immunosuppressive therapy, such as pneumococcal or meningococcal vaccines to prevent serious bacterial infection. Other vaccines are given during therapy against dangerous viral infections such as the vaccine against influenza ( flu ) or      COVID , are also routine.  When are immunizations NOT helpful with treatment? Certain immunizations such as live virus vaccines can only be given when the immune system is back to normal. Examples of live vaccines include      measles-mumps-rubella  (MMR) and varicella (\" chickenpox \"). Full recovery of the immune system can vary with the type of immunosuppressive therapy a child received. It may take up to two years after the end of immunosuppressive therapy to get these types of vaccines. Your doctor may order special blood tests to check your child's immune system to help in deciding which vaccines to give when.  Remember While there may be some changes to your child's immunization schedule when they receive immunosuppressive therapy, there's no need to worry. Your child's care team will work with you and your pediatrician to discuss the latest recommendations to provide your child with the most up-to-date care.

        "content": "By: Aniket Saha, MD, FAAP   Childhood cancer  is rare. It's diagnosed in around 150 children per million around the world. In the United States, the majority of children with cancer are cured. Around 80% end up becoming long-term survivors.    While these statistics are encouraging, it's scary when your child gets a  cancer diagnosis . You'll probably have plenty of questions. You may wonder if you passed on a genetic mutation to your child. Or maybe you're concerned about the risk of cancer in your other children or relatives.  Here are answers to common questions about the role of genes in childhood cancer.  If my child has cancer, what is the risk of their siblings or relatives developing cancer?  That depends on several factors:\t   Does your child have what's  called a \t cancer predisposition syndrome? These syndromes are caused by inherited gene mutations that increase the risk of developing cancer. Below is a list of some of the  types :  Li-Fraumeni syndrome Neurofibromatosis Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome Familial Wilms tumors Downs syndrome Genetic retinoblastoma DNA repair disorders Familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome Other inherited colon cancer syndromes such as ataxia-telangiectasia  Less than 10% of childhood cancers are known to be related to these predisposition syndromes. \t   What type of cancer has your child has been diagnosed with?\t Certain cancers are known to have a higher risk of an inherited genetic mutation. These include: \t Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) Retinoblastoma Optic glioma Pheochromocytoma \t For example, an estimated 50–80% of patients with ACC, a rare childhood cancer, have inherited a genetic mutation. But less than 5% of childhood leukemias, the most common childhood cancers, have a hereditary component. \t   Does your child's cancer have an acquired genetic mutation?  \t A test of your child's cancer may show an acquired mutation in the cancer cells. This is also known as a  somatic mutation . This type of mutation isn't passed down from parent to child. It develops on its own. In fact, most cancers develop this way.    If testing shows that your child has a somatic mutation, you may be worried that the rest of your child's normal (non-cancerous) cells have the mutation too. Thankfully, this isn't the case for most kids.  In a tiny percentage of patients, a somatic mutation may be in the child's whole body. This is called a  germline mutation . Childhood cancer researchers are still trying to figure out how often germline mutations happen. They are also looking into how these mutations affect kids. These researchers are learning new information every day.  Your child's oncologist can answer your questions about somatic and germline mutations once the testing is complete. \t My child's cancer isn't because of any known genetic reason. Is the risk of cancer still higher in their siblings or relatives? \t This is an important question. Unfortunately, the answer isn't entirely clear. Some significant studies have shown that there may be an increased risk of certain cancers in close relatives of children with cancer. \t One study looked at the risk of cancer in first degree relatives (parents and siblings) of over 13,000 childhood cancer survivors in North America. This study showed that the risk of cancer was increased in siblings of childhood cancer survivors. This risk was not necessarily related to a known inherited cancer predisposition syndrome (see above). Studies done with large numbers of childhood cancer survivors in Australia and the United Kingdom also found similar results. \t It's important to note that the cancers in the child's relatives were not always the same. They also didn't necessarily happen during childhood. \t Experts don't fully understand why the risk may be increased for siblings. It's likely due to multiple factors like environment. There may also be genetic causes that scientists haven't discovered yet. \t If there is a family history of cancer in my family, what is the risk of cancer in my child? \t As mentioned earlier, most cancers don't have an inherited genetic reason. But if your  family history  concerns you, consider these questions: \t Is there a strong family history of a similar or related cancer (such as breast and ovarian) in multiple family members?  Has this cancer occurred in multiple generations?  Is there a family history of multiple cancers in some family members?  Did some or all of these cancers happen to younger family members? For example, is there a family history of breast, ovarian, uterine, or colon cancer at an early age?  Is there a family history of unusual or rare cancers?\t Using this information, you can talk to your pediatrician about your child's cancer risk. You can also ask about genetic testing and a referral to a genetic specialist or oncologist. \t What should I do if know that my family has an inherited genetic predisposition syndrome? \t Finding out that there is a family history of a cancer predisposition syndrome can be distressing. Certain syndromes may be suspected based on a physical exam. But they need to be confirmed with genetic testing. \t Some syndromes may not have any obvious physical signs. Your child would need genetic testing for these too. However, if the inherited genetic predisposition is for an adult onset cancer, testing in a child is not recommended. Be sure to talk to your child's pediatrician before you have any testing done. \t My child has a cancer predisposition syndrome. What should I do? \t If your child has such a syndrome, it's understandable that you're worried. Keep in mind that being diagnosed with a cancer predisposition syndrome doesn't mean that your child will definitely get cancer. It means that the risk of your child developing certain cancers is higher compared to the general population. \t Your child's risk depends on the type of syndrome they have and the cancers that are related to it. The risk also depends on your child's age, sex, and environmental factors. \t For certain syndromes, cancer screening guidelines can be used to help detect the cancers that are related to the syndrome. Your pediatrician, a pediatric oncologist, and a genetic specialist can help guide you through all this. \t Remember, less than 10% of cancers have a genetic basis. Most cancers, including childhood cancers, are random. They don't have any cause that can be identified. This is why there is so much ongoing cancer research. Scientists hope to understand better how and why people develop cancer. \t Remember \t Your child's pediatrician,  oncologist , and genetic specialist can address your concerns. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Your child's health is important to everyone on your healthcare team too.

        "content": "​​By: Michael Terao, MD, FAAP & Mary Jane Hogan, MD, MPH, FAAP  If you are reading this, you are a parent or someone who cares for a child or teenager recently diagnosed with cancer. Having a child of any age diagnosed with cancer is an upsetting experience. We would like to provide you with information to help support you through this difficult time.  All feelings are valid  ​ Hope  is an important part of coping. But hope can mean many things. Some parents focus on hope for the day, such as hoping that their child has a good day. Some parents focus on longer-term hope, such as hope that their child will one day be cured. Hope can change during cancer treatment. Try to find both little and big things to hope for. Focus on keeping that hope by sharing it with your child, family, friends, and your child's medical care team so that they can share their hopes with you.\t ​Fear.  It is okay to be afraid. Many parents are afraid of what      chemotherapy and other cancer treatments  will do to their child. Many parents are afraid that their child's cancer will not be cured. Often parents are afraid of not knowing what will happen today or tomorrow. Cancer treatment can have likely and unlikely effects.  Please let your child's doctors or nurses know whatever you fear so that they can answer your questions about cancer treatment. This will help you and your child work through and deal with these fears. Talk to your child's doctor and medical care team about these feelings so that they can address any doubts or questions that arise.\t Anger.  Often parents feel angry for not being able to do more for their child during this time. Some parents are angry at family, friends, their doctors, or even God for not being able to immediately cure their child's cancer. Cancer treatment is a long and confusing journey.  Ways to relieve your anger include taking a slow, deep breath, counting slowly to ten, or taking a walk. Try talking to a friend or family member or asking your child's doctor or medical team for help. \t Guilt.  Some parents blame themselves for not catching the cancer sooner, or for their child having cancer. Other parents feel guilty for not being able to do more to alleviate their child's suffering. Cancer is not any person's fault. The causes of cancer are complicated. Typically, cancer is only detectable when there are enough cancer cells to cause      symptoms , so it is hard to find cancer before cancer appears. \t Sadness.  Sadness is another normal reaction to cancer. Many parents feel sad because cancer has turned their lives upside down. The change from a child who was healthy to a child who needs cancer treatments affects the child, family and friends in different ways. Some parents have feelings of sadness for losing their previous way of living.  Discuss these feelings with your family, friends, your child's doctor, or even your own doctor. It's also important that you find ways to take care of yourself so that you can stay strong and support your child through these challenging times. ​Finding balance​ A child's cancer diagnosis affects the entire family. While caring for your child with cancer is important, you will also need to find ways to balance that care with your job, your spouse, and your other children. This is never easy.\t Everyday needs.  When family and friends offer to help, take them up on it. Make a list of the kinds of things that would be the most helpful, like making meals for your family, giving rides, or running routine household errands. It might also be helpful to simply sit and listen to your feelings. If friends and family can provide the help you need, please ask your doctor or social worker for resources that can help. \t Relationships.  Your child's cancer diagnosis can also put an incredible strain on your relationship with your significant other. Often both parents cannot go to every clinic visit or be together with their child during their hospital stays. It can become difficult to understand what the other parent is going through. This is especially true if one parent is taking on more of the daily caregiving and knows more about things like, how they like to take their medications, which medications to take and when, or even what it is like watching them go through treatment.  Help each other out by writing out questions and instructions on paper, keeping in contact throughout the day, and making important decisions together. Spend time together to talk about things as well as to enjoy each other's company. Ask your child's doctor and medical care team to provide information to both of you so you both have the support you need.\t Finances.  A cancer diagnosis can also be an incredible financial strain. Often a parent will have to leave their job to take care of their child. Financial difficulties can be made worse by the cost of medical care. If you find yourself having financial difficulties do not hesitate to ask your child's doctor or social worker for help. Your child's medical team may be able to find financial resources that can help.\t  \t   ​Talk with your child's doctor if you or your child are feeling unsupported or are confused about anything. Your child's team--the oncology nurses, social workers, psychologists, child life educators--are all experts trained in caring for children and adolescents with cancer, and can be a great source of comfort and information. ​ ​When you are up late worrying and researching your child's diagnosis… It is normal for parents of children with cancer to search the internet for answers. But it's important to keep in mind that cancers in children and adolescents are different from adult cancers. You may read about a child with the same cancer as your child, but their experience may be very different. Remember, cancer statistics are based on large numbers of people and cannot say what will happen with your child.  The best way to get information about your child's cancer is to talk directly with your child's doctor. Do not be afraid to ask specific questions, such as the chances of your child being cured, or what will be done if your child's cancer doesn't get better with initial treatment. Although not all information found on the internet will be reliable, there are sources we recommend for learning more about your child's cancer, including the links below.

        "content": "Bronchiolitis is a common respiratory infection among infants. One of its symptoms is trouble breathing, which can be scary. Read on for more information about bronchiolitis, its causes, signs and symptoms, how to treat it and how to prevent it. What happens if a baby has bronchiolitis? Bronchiolitis causes the small breathing tubes of the lungs (bronchioles) to swell. This blocks airflow through the lungs, making it hard to breathe. It occurs most often in infants because their airways are smaller and more easily blocked than in older children.  What is the difference between bronchiolitis and bronchitis? Bronchiolitis is not the same as bronchitis, which is an infection of the larger, more central airways that typically causes problems in adults.\t   What causes bronchiolitis? Bronchiolitis is caused by one of several respiratory viruses such as    influenza , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ),    parainfluenza  and human metapneumovirus. Other viruses can also cause bronchiolitis. Infants with RSV infection are more likely to get bronchiolitis with    wheezing  and difficulty breathing. Most adults and many older children with RSV infection only get a cold.  RSV is spread by contact with an infected person's mucus or saliva (respiratory droplets produced during coughing or wheezing). It often spreads through families and child care centers. What are the signs and ­symptoms of bronchiolitis? Bronchiolitis often starts with signs of a    cold , such as a runny nose, mild cough and    fever . After 1 or 2 days, the cough may get worse and an infant will begin to breathe faster. Your child may become dehydrated if they cannot comfortably drink fluids. If your child shows any signs of troubled breathing or dehydration (see below), don't hesitate to call their pediatrician.\t The following signs may mean that your baby is having trouble breathing:  They may widen their nostrils and squeeze the ­muscles under their rib cage to try to get more air into and out of his lungs. When they breathe, they may grunt and tighten their stomach muscles. They will make a high-pitched whistling sound, called a wheeze, when they breathes out. They may have trouble drinking because they may have trouble sucking and swallowing. If it gets very hard for your baby to breathe, you may notice a bluish tint around their lips and fingertips. This tells you the airways are so blocked that there is not enough oxygen getting into their blood.\t Your child may become  dehydrated  if they cannot comfortably drink fluids. Call your child's doctor if your baby develops any of the following signs of dehydration:   Drinking less than normal Dry mouth Crying without tears Urinating less often than normal Can bronchiolitis be treated at home? There is no specific treatment for RSV or other viruses that cause bronchiolitis. Antibiotics are not helpful because they treat illnesses caused by bacteria, not viruses. However, you can try to ease your child's symptoms. To relieve a stuffy nose Thin the mucus using saline nose drops recommended by your child's doctor. Never use nonprescription nose drops that contain medicine. Clear your baby's nose with a suction bulb. Squeeze the bulb first. Gently put the rubber tip into one nostril, and slowly release the bulb. This suction will draw the clogged mucus out of the nose. This works best when your baby is younger than 6 months. To relieve fever Give your baby acetaminophen. (Follow the recommended  dosage  for your baby's age.) Do not give your baby aspirin because it has been associated with Reye syndrome, a disease that affects the liver and brain. Check with your child's doctor first before giving any other cold medicines. To prevent dehydration Make sure your baby drinks lots of fluid. They may want clear liquids rather than milk or formula. Your baby may feed more slowly or not feel like eating because they are having trouble breathing. Bronchiolitis and ­severe chronic illness Bronchiolitis may cause more severe illness in ­children who have a chronic illness. \t If you think your child has bronchiolitis and they have any of the following conditions, be sure to call their doctor:\t Cystic fibrosis\t Congenital heart disease Chronic lung disease (seen in some infants who were on breathing machines or respirators as newborns)\t Immune deficiency disease  such as acquired ­immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) Organ or bone marrow transplant A cancer for which she is receiving ­ chemotherapy How will your child's doctor treat bronchiolitis? Your child's doctor will evaluate your child and advise you on nasal suctioning, fever control and observation, as well as when to call back. Some children with bronchiolitis need to be treated in a hospital for breathing problems or dehydration. Breathing problems may need to be treated with oxygen and medicine. Dehydration is treated with a special liquid diet or intravenous (IV) fluids. In very rare cases when these treatments aren't working, an infant might have to be put on a respirator. This is usually only temporary until the infection is gone. How can you prevent your baby from getting bronchiolitis? The best steps you can follow to reduce the risk that your baby becomes infected with RSV or other viruses that cause bronchiolitis include Make sure everyone washes their hands before touching your baby. Keep your baby away from anyone who has a cold, fever, or runny nose. Avoid sharing eating utensils and drinking cups with anyone who has a cold, fever, or runny nose. RSV immunization​  during pregnancy or for your baby right before or during RSV season.  Remember If you have questions about treating ­bronchiolitis, call your child's doctor.

The STD is caused by  Chlamydia trachomatis,  one species of  Chlamydia  bacteria. Another species, called  Chlamydia  (or  Chlamydophila )  pneumoniae,  causes respiratory illnesses. These lung infections are spread in the same way as many other respiratory diseases. They are passed from person to person directly through coughs or sneezes and indirectly from germs on hands or other objects. The number of these infections peaks in school-aged children between 5 and 15 years of age.\t Signs and Symptoms\t Illnesses caused by  C pneumoniae  can cause a prolonged cough, bronchitis, and pneumonia as well as a sore throat, laryngitis, ear infections, and sinusitis. They usually start gradually with a sore throat that is followed by a cough about a week or more later. The cough may last for 2 to 6 weeks. In some cases, the child may get bronchitis or a mild case of pneumonia. While some infected children have only mild to moderate symptoms or no symptoms at all, the infection may be more severe in others.\t How Is the Diagnosis Made?\t Many cases of  C pneumoniae  are diagnosed by a pediatrician after doing a physical examination of the child and looking at his symptoms. The doctor can also order blood tests that detect antibodies to the bacteria. However, it can take a week or more for the antibodies to show up in the blood. Although there are special laboratories that can evaluate swab specimens from the nose or throat, there are no reliable commercially available studies at this time.\t Treatment\t Recovery from a  Chlamydia  respiratory infection may be slow. Your pediatrician can prescribe antibiotics such as erythromycin or tetracycline to clear up the infection and help your child get better faster.\t Prevention\t To lower the chances of your child getting a  C pneumoniae  infection, he should practice good hygiene, including frequent hand washing.",

        "content": "Croup is a common illness in young children. It can be scary for parents as well as children.  Read on for more information about croup, including types, causes, symptoms and treatments. What is croup? Croup is a condition that causes a swelling of the voice box (larynx) and windpipe (trachea). The swelling causes the airway below the vocal cords to become narrow and makes breathing noisy and difficult. It is most commonly caused by an infection. When are children most at risk for croup? Children are most likely to get croup between 3 months and 5 years of age. As they get older, it is not as common because the windpipe is larger and swelling is less likely to get in the way of breathing. Croup can occur at any time of the year, but it is more common in the fall and    winter months .\t \t  Types of croup Viral croup This is the most common type of croup. It is caused by a viral infection of the voice box and windpipe. It often starts out just like a cold, but then it slowly turns into a barky cough. Your child's voice will become hoarse and their breathing will get noisier. They may make a coarse musical sound each time they breathe in, called  stridor .  Most children with viral croup have a    low fever , but some have temperatures up to 104°F (40°C). Spasmodic croup This type of croup is thought to be caused by an allergy or by    reflux  from the stomach. It can be scary because it comes on suddenly, often in the middle of the night. Your child may go to bed well and wake up in a few hours, gasping for breath. They will be hoarse and have stridor when they breathe in. They may also have a barky cough.  Most children with spasmodic croup do not have a fever. This type of croup can recur. It is similar to    asthma  and often responds to    allergy  or reflux medicines. Croup with stridor Stridor is common with mild croup, especially when a child is crying or active. But if your child has stridor while resting, it can be a sign of more severe croup. As your child's effort to breathe increases, they may stop eating and drinking. They may become too tired to cough, and you may hear the stridor more with each breath. The danger of croup with stridor is that sometimes the airway may swell so much that your child may barely be able to breathe. In the most severe cases, your child will not be getting enough oxygen into their blood. If this happens, they need to go to the hospital. Luckily, these most severe cases of croup do not occur very often. Home treatment for croup If your child wakes up in the middle of the night with croup, try to keep them calm. Being upset and crying can worsen the cough and work of breathing.  If your child has a fever (a temperature of 100.4°F [38°C] or higher): Treat it with    acetaminophen  or    ibuprofen  (for children older than 6 months), as needed. Make sure they are drinking fluids to avoid dehydration. \t In the past, parents may have been advised to try steam treatment in the bathroom. Though some parents may find that this helps improve breathing, there are no studies to prove that inhaling steam in a bathroom is effective. There are also no studies to prove that breathing in moist, cool night airs helps improve breathing. When to call the doctor If you are concerned that your child's croup is not improving, contact your child's doctor, local emergency department, or emergency medical services (911) even if it is the middle of the night. Consider calling if your child: Makes a whistling sound that gets louder with each breath Cannot speak or make verbal sounds for lack of breath Seems to be struggling to catch their breath Has bluish lips or fingernails Has stridor when resting Drools or has extreme difficulty swallowing saliva Treating croup with medicine If your child has viral croup, your child's doctor or the emergency department doctor may give them a breathing treatment with    epinephrine  (adrenaline) to decrease the swelling. After epinephrine is given, your child should be observed for 3 to 4 hours to confirm that croup symptoms do not return. A steroid medicine may also be prescribed to reduce the swelling. Steroids can be inhaled, taken by mouth, or given by injection. Treatment with a few doses of steroids should do no harm. Steroids may decrease the intensity of symptoms, the need for other medications, and time spent in the hospital and emergency department. For spasmodic croup, your child's doctor may recommend allergy or reflux medicines to help your child's breathing.\t Antibiotics , which treat bacteria, are not helpful for treating croup because they are almost always caused by a virus or by allergy or reflux. Cough syrups are not useful and may do harm. Other infections Another cause of stridor and serious breathing problems is acute supraglottitis (also called    epiglottitis ). This is a dangerous infection, usually caused by bacteria, with symptoms that can resemble croup. Luckily, this infection is much less common now because of the    Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine . Rarely, supraglottitis is caused by other bacteria. Acute supraglottitis usually affects children 2 to 5 years of age and comes on suddenly with a high fever. Your child may seem very sick. They may have a muffled voice and prefer to sit upright with their neck extended and face tilted upward in a \"sniffing\" position to make breathing easier. They also may drool because they cannot swallow the saliva in their mouth. If not treated, this disease could rapidly lead to complete blockage of your child's airway. If your child's doctor suspects acute supraglottitis: Your child must go to the hospital right away. If they have supraglottitis, they will need antibiotics, and may also need a tube in their windpipe to help them breathe. Call your child's doctor right away if you think your child may have supraglottitis. To protect against acute supraglottitis: Your child should get the first dose of the Hib vaccine when he is 2 months of age. This vaccine will also protect against    meningitis  (a swelling in the covering of the brain). Since the Hib vaccine has been available, the number of cases of acute supraglottitis and meningitis has dramatically decreased. Recurrent or persistent croup When croup persists or recurs frequently, it may be a sign that your child has some narrowing of the airway that is not related to an infection. This may be a problem that was present when your child was born or one that developed later. If your child has persistent or recurrent croup, their doctor may refer you to a specialist such as an    otolaryngologist  (ear, nose, and throat specialist) or    pulmonologist  (breathing and lung disease specialist) for further evaluation. Although most cases of croup are mild, this common childhood illness can become serious and prevent your child from breathing normally. Contact your child's pediatrician if your child's croup is not improving or if you have other concerns. The doctor will make sure your child is evaluated and treated properly.

The infection can be caught by inhaling mists from water contaminated with the germs. Outbreaks have been traced to contaminated  whirlpool spas , humidifiers, and air conditioning cooling towers and have occurred in hospitals, hotels, and cruise ships. The incubation period for legionnaires disease is 2 to 10 days.\t The disease and the organism that causes legionnaires disease were identified and got their names from the first known outbreak, at an American Legion convention held at a Philadelphia, PA, hotel in 1976.\t A related disease called Pontiac fever is caused by the same Legionella species.

Transmission of this organism usually takes place through close contact. Outbreaks have occurred and are common in summer camps and colleges, as well as within households among family members.\t While  M pneumoniae  infections are uncommon in children younger than 5 years, they are a leading cause of pneumonia in school-aged children and young adults.

For example, they are the major cause of croup, which is an inflammation of the voice box (larynx) and windpipe (trachea) that makes breathing more difficult.\t They also cause some cases of lower respiratory tract diseases, including pneumonia (a lung infection) and bronchiolitis (an infection of the lung’s small breathing tubes). They can make the symptoms of chronic lung disease worse in children.\t Parainfluenza viruses have an incubation period of 2 to 6 days. They are spread from person to person by direct contact or exposure to contaminated secretions from the nose or throat. Children are usually exposed to most types of parainfluenza by 5 years of age.\t Signs and Symptoms\t The following symptoms occur in many types of parainfluenza infections, although they may be different from child to child or one kind of infection to another:\t A rough, barking cough\t Rapid, noisy, or labored breathing\t Hoarseness and wheezing\t Redness of the eye\t A runny nose\t Cough\t Fever\t A decline in appetite\t Vomiting\t Diarrhea\t How Is the Diagnosis Made?\t The diagnosis of HPIVs may be made by testing the secretions collected from a sick child’s nose and throat.

As with most infections, it can take several weeks for the antibodies to appear.\t Treatment\t The treatment of viral illnesses, including those caused by parainfluenza viruses, should not involve the use of antibacterials, which are not effective against viruses. Most parainfluenza infections do not require specific treatment other than soothing the symptoms and making your child more comfortable until she feels better. The illness goes away on its own. Antibacterials should only be used if a secondary bacterial infection develops.\t Talk to your pediatrician about whether your child with a fever should be given acetaminophen to lower her body temperature. Make sure she drinks lots of liquids.\t Some supportive therapies are unique to the specific infection that is present. For croup, which is characterized by a barking cough, your child may feel better if you take her into the bathroom, turn on the hot water in the shower, and let the bathroom fill with steam. The warm, moist air should allow her to breathe easier. Breathing in steam is usually helpful, but if it isn’t, take your child outdoors for a few minutes. Inhaling the moist, cool night air may loosen up her airway, and she will be able to breathe easier.\t Your pediatrician may prescribe a dose of corticosteroids for croup. Usually a single dose is all that is needed.\t Prevention\t In the first few months of life, infants have protection against some parainfluenza types because of antibodies from their mothers.\t Keep your child away from youngsters who have viral infections, particularly in the early and most contagious stages. Regular and thorough hand washing is an important way to lower the chances of spreading most viral infections. Your child should not share eating utensils and glasses with a sick youngster.\t A vaccine against parainfluenza viruses is not available, although vaccines against viral types 1 and 3 are in development.",

        "content": "​​The word pneumonia means \" infection of the lung. \" While pneumonia was extremely dangerous in past generations, today most children can recover from it easily if they receive proper medical attention. Most cases of pneumonia follow a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Pneumonia also can be caused by bacterial infections. Also, if a viral infection has irritated the airway enough or weakened a child's immune system, bacteria may begin to grow in the lung, adding a second infection to the original one.  Certain children whose immune defenses or lungs are weakened by other illnesses, such as      cystic fibrosis , asthma, or      cancer  may be more likely to develop pneumonia. Children whose airways or lungs are abnormal in other ways may have a higher risk. Because most forms of pneumonia are linked to viral or bacterial infections that spread from person to person, they're most common during the fall, winter, and early spring, when children spend more time indoors in close contact with others. The chance that a child will develop pneumonia is not affected by how she is dressed or by air temperature on cold days. Signs & symptoms of pneumonia in children Like many infections, pneumonia usually produces a      fever , which in turn may cause sweating, chills, flushed skin, and general discomfort. The child also may lose her appetite and seem less energetic than normal. Babies and toddlers may seem pale and limp, and cry more than usual. ​​Because pneumonia can cause breathing difficulties, you may notice these other, more specific symptoms, too:\t Cough\t Fast, labored breathing\t Drawing in of the skin between and around the ribs and breastbone\t Flaring (widening) of the nostrils\t Pain in the chest, particularly with coughing or ​deep breathing\t Wheezing\t Bluish tint to the lips or nails, caused by decreased oxygen in the bloodstream\t   Although the diagnosis of pneumonia usually can be made on the basis of the signs, symptoms and examination, a  chest X-ray  sometimes is necessary to make certain and to determine the extent of lung involvement.\t Pneumonia treatment When pneumonia is caused by a virus, usually there is no specific treatment other than rest and the usual measures for fever control. Cough suppressants containing codeine or dextromethorphan should not be used, because coughing is helpful in clearing the excessive secretions caused by the infection. Viral pneumonia usually improves after a few days, although the cough may linger for several weeks.  Because it is often difficult to tell whether the pneumonia is caused by a virus or by a bacteria, your pediatrician may prescribe an      antibiotic . All antibiotics should be taken for the full prescribed course and at the specific dosage recommended. You may be tempted to discontinue them early, but you should not do so—some bacteria may remain, and the infection might return unless the entire course is completed. ​​Check b​ack with the doctor if your child shows any of the following warning signs that the infection is worsening or spreading.\t ​​Fever lasting mor​​e than a few days despite using antibiotics\t Fever that goes away and then returns after a few days\t Breathing difficulties\t Increased lethargy and sleepiness\t Evidence of an infection elsewhere in the body: red, swollen joints, bone pain, neck stiffness, vomiting, or other new symptoms or signs\t   Prevention: the pneumonia vaccine Your child can be vaccinated against      pneumococcal infections , a bacterial cause of pneumonia. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children starting at 2 months of age receive this immunization (called      pneumococcal conjugate or PCV13 ).      A series of doses  needs to be given at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age, at the same time that children receive other childhood vaccines. If your child did not receive the first doses at the recommended times, talk to your pediatrician about a catch-up schedule. One dose of PCV13 should be given to all healthy children who are aged 2 through 5 years who have not previously received their recommended doses before the age of 2 years and to children aged 2 years through 18 years with certain underlying medical conditions who have not previously received a dose of PCV13. Another pneumococcal vaccine (pneumococcal polysaccharide or PPV23) also is recommended for older children (2 through 5 years of age) who have a high risk of developing an invasive pneumococcal infection. These include children with:\t Sickle cell anemia Heart disease Lung disease Kidney failure Damaged or no spleen Organ transplant\t HIV  (human immunodeficiency virus) infection It's also recommended for children taking medications or who have diseases that weaken their immune system. Some children with certain underlying medical conditions may need a second dose of pneumococcal vaccine given at lease 8 weeks later.

        "content": "By: Mary Caserta, MD, FAAP & Andrea Jones, MD, FAAP Almost all children get respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) at least once before they are 2 years old. For most healthy children, RSV is like a cold. But some children get very sick with RSV. If you are the parent of a baby or young child, you may have questions about RSV and how to prevent it. Read on to learn more. What is RSV? RSV is one of the many viruses that cause respiratory illness. It spreads like a    cold  virus from person to person. It enters the body through the nose or eyes, usually from contact with infected saliva, mucus or nasal discharge. This virus usually occurs in the late fall through early spring months. The timing can vary in some parts of the country. RSV is the most common cause of hospitalization in children under age 1 year. Two to three out of every 100    infants with RSV infection  may require a    hospital stay . Those babies may need    oxygen  to help with breathing or (intravenous) IV fluids if they are not eating or drinking. Most of these children get better and can go home after a few days. New ways to protect babies from RSV Two new tools protect babies from severe illness during RSV season. You can choose    RSV immunization during pregnancy , or your baby can be immunized after they are born. Most infants will likely only need protection from either the maternal RSV vaccine or infant immunization, but not both. RSV vaccine during pregnancy Pregnant people can receive the    maternal RSV vaccine  at 32 through 36 weeks pregnancy if their baby will be born during RSV season. The vaccine reduces the risk of RSV hospitalization for babies by 57% in their first six months after birth.  RSV immunization for babies For infants and some toddlers, an RSV immunization called nirsevimab can be given as an injection and may be included with or between your baby's routine immunizations. Nirsevimab has been shown to reduce the risk of both RSV-related hospitalizations and health care visits in infants by about 80%. The shot works a little differently than a vaccine. It provides antibodies that start working to protect babies right away. The protection lasts throughout a typical RSV season.\t Watch this video about new immunization options to prevent RSV: What about palivizumab? For some children, there is another product called palivizumab that is given as an injection once a month during RSV season. It is for children under age 24 months with certain conditions that place them at high risk for severe RSV. Children who receive nirsevimab should not get palivizumab. However, if your child did not get all doses of palivizumab, they may be eligible for nirsevimab. Children who received palivizumab in their first season can get nirsevimab in their second season if they are eligible. RSV symptoms in babies Typically, RSV causes cold symptoms, which may be followed by    bronchiolitis  or pneumonia.    RSV symptoms are typically at their worst on days 3 through 5 of illness.  Symptoms generally last an average of 7-14 days.\t Cold: Upper Respiratory Tract Infection\t Bronchiolitis: Lower Respiratory Tract Infection Cold symptoms may include:  Fever (temperature of 100.4 or higher)\t Cough (dry or wet sounding) Congestion R unny nose Sneezing Fussiness Poor    feeding May include    cold symptoms , plus: Fast breathing Flaring of the nostrils & h ead bobbing with breathing Rhythmic grunting during breathing    (see sound clip clip, below) Belly breathing, tugging between the ribs and/or the lower neck    (see video, below) Wheezing\t \t \t How hard is your baby breathing? What to look for. Chest wall retractions happen when a baby must use muscles between the ribs or in the neck to breathe. It is a sign that your baby is having to work harder than normal to breathe.\t Watch your child's rib cag e as they inhale.  If you see it \"caving in\" and forming an upside-down \"V\" shape under the neck, then they are working too hard.   \t  \t   Call your pediatrician right away if your child has any: Symptoms of bronchiolitis    (listed above) Symptoms of    dehydration  (fewer than 1 wet diaper every 8 hours) Pauses or difficulty breathing Pale, gray or blue-colored skin, lips or nail beds, depending on skin tone Significantly decreased activity and alertness\t Some children with RSV may be at increased risk of developing a bacterial infection, such as an  ear infection . Call your doctor if your child has: Symptoms that worsen or do not start to improve after 7 days A    fever  (with a rectal temperature of 100.4°F or higher) and they are younger than 3 months of age (12 weeks). A    fever  that rises above 104°F repeatedly for a child of any age. Poor sleep or fussiness, chest pain, ear tugging or ear drainage Pediatricians diagnose children with a cold or bronchiolitis by asking about their symptoms and by doing a physical exam. Your pediatrician may do a nasal swab test to determine if your child has RSV or another virus. A chest x-ray and/or oxygen saturation test may also be done to check for lung congestion. Because most children recover without difficulty and because there is no treatment specific for RSV, these tests are often not necessary. How to help your child with mild RSV feel better\t There is no specific treatment for RSV  and medications, like steroids and antibiotics, do not help with RSV. To help your child feel more comfortable, begin by doing what you    would for any bad cold :\t Nasal saline with gentle suctioning  to allow easier breathing and feeding.\t Cool-mist  humidifier  to help break up mucus and allow easier breathing.\t Fluids & frequent feedings.  Make sure your child is staying    hydrated . Infants with a common cold may feed more slowly or not feel like eating because they are having trouble breathing. Try to section baby's nose before trying to breast or bottle-feed. Supplementing with water or formula is unnecessary for breastfed babies. If difficult for the baby to feed at the breast,    expressing  breastmilk into a cup or bottle may be an option.\t   Acetaminophen or ibuprofen  (if older than 6 months) to help with low-grade fevers. Always    avoid  aspirin and cough and cold    medications . Keep in mind,    children and adults can get RSV  multiple times—even during a single season. Often, however, repeat infections are less severe than the first one. Other ways to help prevent RSV\t Stay up to date on vaccines.  Keep your children up to date on their    immunizations  and get the whole family    annual flu  and COVID shots. Adults over age 60 years can get the    RSV vaccine . And getting vaccinated with    Tdap ―to protect against    whooping cough —is especially important for adults who are around infants.\t Limit your baby's exposure  to crowds, other children, and anyone with colds. Keep children home from school or    child care  when they are sick and teach them to cover their coughs and sneezes.\t   Wash your hands .  Just as you would to prevent germs at any time, use soap and water and scrub for at least 20 seconds. Remind children to practice good hand hygiene all through the year.\t Go germ-free.  Disinfect objects and surfaces in your home regularly and avoid exposing your child to smoke from tobacco or other substances.\t Feed your baby breastmilk.   It has    unique antibodies  to prevent and fight infections. Medicine is always advancing! Scientists continue to explore    new options  to prevent and treat RSV. In the meantime, rest assured that most people recover well from RSV.

Call 911 or an ambulance right away if your child:  Makes a whistling sound (called stridor) that gets louder with each breath. Cannot speak because of a lack of breath. Seems to struggle to get a breath. Has a bluish color of the lips, mouth, or fingernails. Drools or has trouble swallowing. Care of Your Child at the Hospital: At the hospital, your child's doctor will decide the best way to treat your child. Treatments may include the following:  Epinephrine.  This medicine can help reduce swelling in the upper airways so that your child can breathe better. Epinephrine is given through a nebulizer. A nebulizer is a machine that turns liquid medicine into a fine mist. The mist is breathed in through a mouthpiece or face mask. Often, when this medicine is used, doctors prefer to continue to watch a child for several hours after it is given. This sometimes requires a stay in the hospital. Corticosteroids.  These medicines can be useful in reducing inflammation in the body. They work in 2 ways. Systemic corticosteroids must go through the body to treat the inflammation in the upper airway. Inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids go directly to where the inflammation is.  Oxygen.  Sometimes when breathing is very difficult for a child, the body may not get enough oxygen and the work of breathing increases. Oxygen given through a mask or a small tube near the nose will make it easier to breathe. When Can My Child Go Home? As soon as your child's breathing improves, usually within a few hours, he will be allowed to go home. Sometimes a child with croup will stay in the hospital overnight for observation.   Additional Information from HealthyChildren.org:  Croup and Your Young Child Fever and Your Baby Diagnosing Asthma in Babies & Toddlers Treating Bronchiolitis in Infants Protecting Your Baby from RSV",

        "content": "There is no specific treatment for  RSV  or the other virus that cause  bronchiolitis .  Antibiotics  are not helpful because they treat illnesses caused by bacteria, not viruses. However, you can try to ease your child's symptoms. To relieve a stuffy nose: Thin the mucus  using saline nose drops recommended by your child's doctor. Never use nonprescription nose drops that contain any medicine. Clear your baby's nose with a suction bulb . Squeeze the bulb first. Gently put the rubber tip into one nostril, and slowly release the bulb. This suction will draw the clogged mucus out of the nose. This works best when your baby is younger than 6 months. To relieve fever: Give your baby  acetaminophen .  ( Follow the recommended dosage for your child's age ) . Do not give your baby aspirin because it has been associated with  Reye syndrome , a disease that affects the liver and brain. Check with your child's doctor first before giving any other cold medicines. To prevent dehydration: Make sure your baby drinks lots of fluid . She may want clear liquids rather than milk or formula. She may feed more slowly or not feel like eating because she is having trouble breathing. How will your pediatrician treat bronchiolitis? Your pediatrician will evaluate your child and advise you on nasal suctioning, fever control, and observation, and when to call her back.  Some children with bronchiolitis need to be treated in a hospital for breathing problems or dehydration. Breathing problems may need to be treated with oxygen and medicine. Dehydration is treated with a special liquid diet or intravenous (IV) fluids. In very rare cases when these treatments aren't working, an infant might have to be put on a respirator. This usually is only temporary until the infection is gone. How can you prevent your baby from getting bronchiolitis? The best steps you can follow to reduce the risk that your baby becomes infected with  RSV  or other viruses that can cause bronchiolitis include: Make sure everyone  washes their hands  before touching your baby. Keep your baby away from anyone who has a cold, fever, or runny nose. Avoid sharing eating utensils and drinking cups with anyone who has a cold, fever, or runny nose. If you have questions about the treatment of bronchiolitis, call your child's doctor.

        "content": "​Each year in the United States, there are about 9,000 new cases of tuberculosis (TB). TB is a rare but contagious disease caused by a bacterium called      Mycobacterium tuberculosis . It primarily affects the lungs, but can also target parts of the body. While the disease is less common than it once was, some groups of children and teens have a high risk of getting this germ. Here's what parents should know. Who is at risk for TB infection? Children and teens at higher risk include those who: Are living in a household with an adult who has active tuberculosis  Were born in a country that has a            high prevalence  of TB Are            visiting a country  where TB is endemic and who have extended contact with people who live there Some groups of children have a high risk of severe disease if they become infected. These include: Children who are younger than 4 years old, or teenagers who have started puberty Children who have a problem with their immune system (including those who are infected with HIV, or take medications that will decrease their body's immune system)  How does TB spread? Tuberculosis usually is spread when an infected adult coughs the bacteria into the air. These germs are inhaled by the child or teen, who then becomes infected. Children younger than about 12 years old with TB of the lungs rarely infect other people. This is because young children tend to have very few bacteria in their mucus secretions. Also, their coughs typically do not spread germs as effectively as when adults coughs.  Symptoms of TB  Fortunately, most children and adolescents exposed to tuberculosis don't become ill. When the bacteria reach their lungs, the body's immune system attacks the germs and prevents further spread. This symptom-free infection can only be identified by a positive blood test or skin test. However, even if your child has a symptom-free infection, they still must treated. This is to reduce the risk that, in the future, the infection will worsen into disease. Occasionally, in a small number of children or teens without proper treatment, the infection does progress. It can cause fever, fatigue, irritability, a persistent cough, weakness, heavy and fast breathing, night sweats,      swollen glands , weight loss, and poor growth. In an even smaller number of those infected with TB--mostly those less than four years old, adolescents who have started puberty, or anyone with a weakened immune system--the TB germ spreads through the bloodstream. When this happens, it can affect virtually any organ in the body. This type of TB illness requires complicated treatment. The earlier it is found and the treatment is started, the better the outcome.  How is TB diagnosed? If your child is at risk for getting TB or having severe disease, they should be tested. The type of test depends on the age of the person: If younger than 2 years old, they should receive a            tuberculin skin test  (usually called a TST, and also called the TB skin test). If 2 years of age or older, they can have blood drawn for a test called an            interferon-gamma release assay  (usually called an IGRA, and also called the TB blood test). A skin test can be done on older children, but the blood test is preferred.\t   Your child may need a TB blood test or TB skin test if you answer yes to at least one of the following questions:\t Has a family member or contact had tuberculosis disease? Has a family member had a positive TB blood test or TB skin test? Was your child or teenager born in a high-risk country (countries other than the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or Western European countries)? Has your child or teenager traveled (had contact with resident populations) to a high-risk country for more than one week? Does your child or teenager have a weakened immune system?  The IGRA test is done by having blood drawn into a tube, which is then sent to a laboratory. The laboratory will test the blood for the IGRA, and results will be sent to your pediatrician.  The TST is performed in your pediatrician's office by injecting purified, inactive pieces of the TB germ into the skin of the forearm. If there has been an infection, your child's skin will swell and redden at the injection site. Your pediatrician will check the skin forty-eight to seventy-two hours after the injection, and measure the diameter of the reaction.  Both the IGRA (TB blood test) and TST (TB skin test) means that your child's body has experienced the bacteria, even if the child has had no symptoms and even if their body has fought the disease successfully. Neither of the TB blood test nor the TB skin test will actually cause or worsen a TB infection. Treatment for TB\t If your child's TB blood test or TB skin test is positive:  A            chest X-ray  will be ordered to determine if there is evidence of active or past infection in the lungs. If the X-ray does indicate the possibility of active infection, your pediatrician also will search for the TB bacteria in your child's cough secretions or in their stomach. This is done in order to determine the type of treatment needed.\t If your child's TB blood test or TB skin test is positive, but they do not have symptoms or signs of active tuberculosis infection:  They are still infected. Your pediatrician will prescribe medications to reduce the risk of the infection getting worse. The type of medication is based on what is best suited for your child's age, ability to swallow pills, and whether the medication is taken at home or at the pediatrician's office.\t For an               active  tuberculosis infection:  Your pediatrician will prescribe three or four medications. You will have to give these to your child for 6 to 12 months. Your child or teenager may have to be hospitalized at first to get treatment is started, although most of it can be carried out at home.  It is very important that children or anyone being treated for tuberculosis  finish the medicine  and take the drugs exactly as instructed. Controlling the spread of TB If your child has been infected with TB, regardless of whether they develop symptoms, it's very important to try to identify the person they caught it from. Usually this is done by looking for symptoms of TB in everyone who came in close contact with your child. The most common symptom in adults is a persistent cough, especially one that is associated with coughing up blood.  A TB blood or TB skin test may be recommended for all family members, babysitters, and housekeepers. Anyone who has a positive TB blood test or TB skin test should be examined by a medical provider, get a chest X-ray, and start treatment. \t When an active infection is found in an adult:  The adult should be isolated as much as possible–especially from young children–until treatment is under way. All family members who have been in contact with that person usually are also treated with INH, regardless of the results of their own TB blood test or TB skin test. Anyone who becomes ill or develops an abnormality on a chest X-ray should be treated as an active case of tuberculosis.\t If an adult with an active infection is untreated:  Tuberculosis can be controlled by the immune system for many years, only to break free during adolescence, pregnancy, or later adulthood. At that time, not only can the individual become quite ill, but they also can spread the infection to those around them. That's why it is very important to have your child or teenager to be tested for TB if they come in close contact with any adult who has the disease. This helps ensure they can get get prompt, appropriate treatment if their TB blood test or TB skin test is positive. Remember Talk with your pediatrician if you have any questions about TB or other infectious diseases.

        "content": "Pertussis, or whooping cough, is caused by bacteria that attack the lining of the breathing passages. Severe coughing is one of the major symptoms.    Because a child is short of breath, they inhale deeply and quickly between coughs. The breaths often make a \"whooping\" sounds, which is how this illness got its common name. The intense coughing scatters the pertussis bacteria into the air, and can spread the disease to others. Pertussis on the rise Many years ago, there were several hundred thousand cases of whooping cough each year in the United States. With the development of a    vaccine for pertussis , that number dropped. But in recent years, U.S. cases have gone up. Because of this, giving the pertussis vaccine to children and their caregivers is more important than ever.  Infants under one year of age are at greatest risk of developing severe breathing problems and life-threatening illness from whooping cough. Symptoms of pertussis Pertussis often acts like a common cold for a week or two. Then the cough gets worse (rather than better, as usually happens with a cold), and older children may start to have the characteristic \"whoop.\" During this phase, which can last two weeks or more, your child may often be short of breath. They may look bluish around the mouth. In addition, they may tear, drool, and vomit. \t \t  Young infants with pertussis may have episodes where they appear to stop breathing or have vomiting after a long bout of coughs. Infants with pertussis become exhausted and develop complications, becoming more vulnerable to other infections,    pneumonia , and    seizures . Pertussis can be fatal in some infants, but the usual course is for recovery to begin after two to four more weeks.  The cough of pertussis, which has also been called the \"100 day cough,\" may not disappear for months, and may return with future respiratory infections. When to call the pediatrician Pertussis infection starts out acting like a cold. You should consider the possibility of whooping cough if: Your child is a very young infant who has not been fully immunized and/or has had exposure to someone with a chronic cough or the disease. Their cough becomes more severe and frequent, or their lips and fingertips become dark or blue. They become exhausted after coughing episodes, eat poorly, vomit after coughing, and look \"sick.\" When your child needs hospital care Most infants who are less than six months old with whooping cough need to be initially    treated in the hospital . Slightly less than half of older babies with the disease are initially treated in the hospital, too. This more intensive care can decrease the chances of complications. These complications can include pneumonia, which occurs in slightly less than one fourth of children under one year old who have whooping cough. If your child is older, they are more likely to be treated only at home. While in the hospital, your child may need to have the thick respiratory secretions suctioned. Their breathing will be monitored, and they may need to be given oxygen. Your child will be isolated from other patients to keep the infection from spreading to them. Treatment for pertussis Whooping cough is treated with an antibiotic that is most effective when given in the first stage of illness, before the coughing spells begin. Although    antibiotics  can stop the spread of the whooping cough infection, they cannot prevent or treat the cough itself. Because    cough medicines  do not relieve the coughing spells, your pediatrician probably will recommend other forms of home treatment to help manage the cough. Let your child rest in bed and use a cool-mist vaporizer to help soothe their irritated lungs and breathing passages. A vaporizer also will help loosen secretions in the respiratory tract.  Ask your pediatrician for instructions on the best position for your child to help drain those secretions and improve breathing. Also ask whether antibiotics or vaccine boosters need to be given to others in your household to prevent them from developing the disease. Your child should stay home from child care until finishing five days of antibiotics. How to protect your baby against pertussis The best way to protect your child against pertussis is with    DTaP vaccination  (immunizations at two months, four months, and six months of age, and booster shots at twelve to eighteen months and at four or five years of age or prior to starting school).  \t   See \t \t  Recommended Immunization Schedules . \t Parents or family members who will be in close contact with babies younger than one year old should also receive the    Tdap  booster. This lowers the risk of passing the infection to the infant.  In addition, all women who are pregnant should get the Tdap vaccine during each pregnancy. This allows mothers to pass on protection against pertussis to their newborns.",

        "content": "By: James Harper, MD, FAAP Alpha and Beta  thalassemias  are common inherited forms of anemia that affect millions of people around the world. Most people have a mild form of thalassemia without any problems, while others have more severe but rare forms that need medical help. Your baby's  newborn screening , a simple blood test taken from pricking the baby's heel within 2 days of age, is able to detect some forms of thalassemia. Read on to learn more about thalassemia and how to work with your baby's doctor to provide the best care for your child. What are alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia? Thalassemias are a group of health conditions that cause anemia or lower than normal red blood cells in the body. The  anemia  results from your body making less hemoglobin, the protein in the red blood cell that carries oxygen to the body. Normal hemoglobin is made up of two different proteins chains called alpha globin and beta globin. In people with thalassemia, either the alpha globin chains are decreased, resulting in alpha thalassemia — or the beta globin chains are decreased, resulting in beta thalassemia. What are the different forms of alpha thalassemia? Alpha thalassemia comes in four forms with different degrees of health problems depending on how many of the four alpha globin genes are missing. The forms and severity of health issues do not change during a person's lifetime. Alpha thalassemia silent carrier Babies who are born with one missing alpha globin gene have a very mild form of alpha thalassemia called \"silent carrier.\" Babies with this form do NOT have health problems.    Alpha thalassemia trait (or alpha thalassemia minor) Babies who are born with two missing alpha globin genes have a mild form called \"alpha thalassemia trait or alpha thalassemia minor.\" Babies with this condition do NOT have health problems. They will have small red blood cells with or without mild anemia. Since the red blood cells in babies with this condition look similar to red blood cells found in babies with iron deficiency, it is important for your child's doctor to know when to test for and treat iron deficiency. Hemoglobin H disease Babies who are born with three missing alpha globin genes have a rare, moderate to severe condition called \"hemoglobin H disease.\" Babies with this condition have moderate to severe anemia and may need blood transfusions at different times throughout their lives. Contact your doctor if your child is experiencing any of or worsening of the signs or symptoms of moderate to severe anemia listed below. Alpha thalassemia major Babies who are born with all four missing alpha globin genes have \"alpha thalassemia major\" or hydrops fetalis. This very rare, life-threatening condition results in fetuses or babies who often die due to very severe anemia despite intensive medical care. What are the different forms of beta thalassemia? Beta thalassemia comes in three forms with different degrees of health problems depending on one or two beta globin genes mutations. The forms do not change during a person's lifetime.  Beta thalassemia trait (or beta thalassemia minor) Babies with this condition will have small red blood cells with mild anemia. Since the red blood cells in babies with beta thalassemia trait look similar to red blood cells found in babies with iron deficiency, it is important for your child's doctor to know when to test for and treat iron deficiency. Beta thalassemia intermedia This is a moderate form called \"beta thalassemia intermedia\" or \"non-transfusion dependent beta thalassemia. Babies with this condition have small red blood cells with mild to moderate anemia rarely needing blood transfusions. Contact your doctor if your child is experiencing any of the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe anemia listed below. Beta thalassemia major (or transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia) Babies born with both beta globin genes altered may have a severe form called \"beta thalassemia major\" or \"transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.\" Babies with this serious condition will require blood transfusions every 2-6 weeks beginning within weeks after birth to maintain life.  Mutations that result in the body making NO beta globin chains result in the most severe form often labeled as \"Beta -zero (β0) thalassemia\" or \"Cooley's anemia\". Mutations that allow a small amount of beta globin chains to be made are labelled \"Beta-plus (β+) thalassemia\" and tend to need less frequent blood transfusions. It is important to know that beta thalassemia can be inherited along with other mutations in the beta globin genes that affect the body in more severe ways such as  sickle cell disease .  What are the signs and symptoms of moderate and severe anemia? Signs and symptoms of moderate and severe anemia may include:  Pale or yellow skin and eyes Orange or darker urine (from red blood cell break down) A large spleen, liver or heart (organs inside the body that keep the body healthy) Poor appetite and feeling tired Slow growth and delayed puberty Excess growth and thinning of bones What are the treatments for moderate and severe thalassemia? Treatments for moderate and severe thalassemias are constantly improving and are best managed by pediatric hematologists. In addition to life-saving blood transfusions, iron needs to be removed from the body with medications called iron chelators, and vitamins such as folic acid are given help improve health.  New advances in stem cell transplantation and gene therapies are yielding promising results as potential cures. Remember Alpha and beta thalassemia detected on a newborn screen can vary in severity and in form. Your doctor can arrange for the appropriate referrals to a pediatric hematologist and genetic counsellor.

        "content": "Anemia is a condition in which the amount of red blood cells in the body is decreased below normal for your child's age. It can make your child appear pale in color and feel cranky, tired, or weak. Though these symptoms may worry you, the most common causes of anemia ― such as iron deficiency ― are generally easy to treat, especially when it is detected early. In addition, parents need to be aware of the steps to take to prevent this condition.\t Because rapid growth is a potential cause of the condition, the first year of life and adolescence are two age groups where infants and children are especially prone to anemia. What is anemia? Anemia means there are not enough red blood cells in the body. Red blood cells are filled with hemoglobin, a special pigmented protein that makes it possible to carry and deliver oxygen to other cells in the body. The cells in your child's muscles and organs need oxygen to survive, and decreased numbers of red blood cells can place stress on the body.  Your child may become anemic if his or her body:\t Does not produce enough red blood cells.  This can happen if she does not have enough iron or other nutrients in her diet (e.g. iron-deficiency anemia). \t Destroys too many red blood cells.  This type of anemia usually happens when a child has an underlying illness or has inherited a red blood cell disorder (e.g.            sickle-cell anemia ).\t Loses red blood cells through bleeding.  This can either be obvious blood loss, such as heavy menstrual bleeding, or long-term low-grade blood loss, perhaps in the stool.  What are the common signs and symptoms of anemia?  Pale or sallow (yellow) skin Pale cheeks and lips Lining of the eyelids and the nail beds may look less pink than normal Irritability Mild weakness Tiring easily, napping more frequently Children experiencing red blood cell destruction may become jaundiced (yellowing of the skin or eyes) and have dark tea or cola-colored urine Children with severe anemia may have additional signs and symptoms: Shortness of breath Rapid heart rate Swollen hands and feet Headaches Dizziness and fainting Restless leg syndrome When kids eat non-foods:  ​Children with anemia caused by very low levels of iron in their blood may also eat strange non-food things such as ice, dirt, clay, paper, cardboard, and cornstarch. This behavior is called \" pica \" (pronounced pie-kuh). Pica often occurs in children who are low in iron and can cause constipation. In these children, the pica usually stops after the anemia is treated with iron supplements.  If your child shows any of these signs or symptoms, please see your pediatrician.\t  Even a low level of anemia can affect your child's energy, focus, and ability to learn. Chronic iron deficiency anemia can result in long term, permanent impairment of development. In most cases, a simple blood count can diagnose anemia. How can I prevent my child from becoming anemic?  Iron-deficiency anemia and other nutritional anemias can be prevented by ensuring that your child eats a well-balanced diet. Talk with your doctor about any specific dietary restrictions in your household as your child      may  require a  nutritional supplementation  to prevent anemia.  ​Here are ways to prevent nutritional anemias: Do not give your baby cow's milk until he or she is over 12 months old . Giving cow's milk before your child is ready may cause blood loss in his or her stool and can also decrease the amount of iron absorbed in the gut. If you are breastfeeding:  Your baby will have an adequate supply of iron until at least 4 months of age. At 4 months of age breastfed infants should be  supplemented with iron  until they are eating enough complementary foods that contain are rich in iron (e.g. red meat or iron-fortified cereals). Talk with your pediatrician about foods best suited for this purpose, and how much additional iron supplementation is needed. If you formula-feed your baby:  Give your baby formula with added iron. Low-iron formula can result in iron-deficiency anemia and should not be used.  See  Choosing a Formula .   After 12 months of age, avoid giving your child more than 2 cups a day of whole cow's milk . Milk is low in iron and can make children feel full, which can decrease the amount of other iron-rich foods they eat. Feed older children a well-balanced diet with foods that contain iron.  Many grains and cereals have added iron (check labels to be sure). Other good sources of iron include red meat, egg yolks, potatoes, tomatoes, beans, molasses, and raisins.  See  Pump Up the Diet with Iron . Encourage the whole family to eat citrus fruits or eat other foods high in Vitamin C  to increase the body's absorption of iron. Although green vegetables contain lots of iron, the iron from many vegetables comes in a form that is difficult for your body to absorb, but Vitamin C can help! How can I manage anemia if my child has an inherited red blood cell disorder? Your pediatrician will likely refer you to a      pediatric hematologist  to provide you with supportive care and education on your child's specific condition. Remember: If your child starts to show any signs or symptoms of anemia, be sure to tell your pediatrician. Also, find out if anyone in your  family has a history of anemia  or problems with easy bleeding. With proper treatment, your child's anemia should improve quickly.

        "content": "By: Jayson Stoffman, MD, FRCPC, FAAP  Our body has a variety of important ways to protect us from too much bleeding after we get injured. Unfortunately, sometimes children are born with (inherit) a blood condition that causes mild or even severe bleeding after injuries or surgery. This is because their blood does not clot normally to control the bleeding.  Fortunately, there are treatments for these pediatric bleeding disorders. Learn more here. What are the symptoms of bleeding disorders in children?  Children with bleeding disorders can have mild or severe bleeding symptoms.  Mild bleeding disorders Common symptoms in children born with mild bleeding disorders include easy skin bruising or bleeding from the gums or nose. Adolescents may have heavy menstrual periods. Some children born with mild bleeding disorders only have heavy bleeding after injuries or surgeries.  Severe bleeding disorders Children with severe bleeding disorders often have bruising or too much bleeding noticed at or soon after birth. In these children, heavy bleeding can happen in the skin, gums, and nose. in addition to the brain, intestines, joints, or muscles after major, minor, or no known injuries.  How does the blood normally clot after injury?  Some injuries to the body cause breaks in blood vessels, the tubes that carry blood. The broken blood vessels contract or narrow to decrease the blood flow out of the body. Then, cells in the blood called platelets plug the holes by sticking to the blood vessel and to other platelets with the help of a protein called von Willebrand factor (vWF). To make the plug more stable, a cascade of blood proteins called coagulation or clotting factors (including Factor VIII and Factor IX, discussed below) are released to build a solid clot.    What are the most common types of bleeding disorders in children? Two of the most common types of bleeding disorders are von Willebrand disease and hemophilia.  What is von Willebrand disease?  Von Willebrand disease (vWD) is a group of bleeding disorders caused by problems with a blood clotting protein called von Willebrand factor (vWF). vWD can be inherited in an \"autosomal dominant\" way. This means that if one parent has vWD, then there is a 50% chance of passing it on to each child.  The most common inherited type of vWD is type 1 vWD. About 1 in 20 people are born with this bleeding disorder. In the blood of a child born with type 1 vWD, the amount of vWF is less than normal.  Other types of vWD are more rare. In the blood of a child with type 2 vWD, the amount of vWF might be normal but it doesn't work properly. In the blood of a child with type 3 vWD , vWF is missing. Although type 3 vWD causes the most severe bleeding issues, it is also the most rare type.  How is von Willebrand disease treated?  Fortunately, most children born with vWD will have mild bleeding problems, which occur rarely. So, often there is no need for regular medications. However, some adolescents and adults who menstruate can have heavy periods that need control with hormones.  The medications to prevent or treat excess bleeding from surgeries, dental extractions or injuries in children with vWD depend on the type of vWD and the actual symptoms.  Most children with Type 1 vWD who have bleeding problems can use a medication called desmopressin, which can be given as a shot under the skin, into a vein or as a spray into the nose. Desmopression helps the body release vWF stored in the lining of blood vessels to create a blood clot. Desmopressin also helps some children with Type 2 vWD.  Another treatment is to replace the missing or abnormal vWF with an intravenous (into the vein) vWF collected from donated blood plasma. vWF concentrate is helpful to treat bleeding for all people with Type 3 vWD and some with type 1 and 2 vWD. A new, recombinant (genetically created) vWF concentrate is being developed to replace the blood-donated versions.  What is hemophilia?  The hemophilias are a group of inherited bleeding disorders caused by deficient or missing clotting factors called Factor VIII deficiency (or Hemophilia A) or Factor IX deficiency (or Hemophilia B). Without these clotting factors, a stable blood clot cannot form and a child with hemophilia can have severe bleeding symptoms at birth.  Hemophilia A and Hemophilia B result from inheriting a mutation on the X chromosome from a parent. While hemophilia and severe bleeding most often occur in males who have one X and one Y chromosome, females who have two X chromosome (with one copy of the normal factor gene) can be carriers for hemophilia with no symptoms or mild bleeding symptoms. One third of people with hemophilia have a new mutation, while the other two-thirds usually have a family history in uncles or grandfathers.  How is hemophilia treated?  Treatment of Hemophilia A and B has traditionally focused on replacing the missing clotting factor.  Most boys with Hemophilia A and many with Hemophilia B are treated prophylactically (preventatively) with intravenous clotting factor replacement on a regular basis. Preventative doses minimize the risk of bleeding, including minor bleeds which still cause long-term joint damage. Boys will also be treated \"on demand\" when they have an injury or bleeding symptoms.  Since clotting factor replacement must be given intravenously, parents and eventually the children are taught to infuse at a very young age. Unfortunately, this hemophilia treatment can result in unwanted development of inhibitors or antibodies (immune proteins) that make the replacement clotting factor not work anymore, causing bleeding to continue.  More promising hemophilia treatments on the horizon Better therapies for hemophilia are becoming more widely available. Longer-acting intravenous factor replacements have been developed, which provide protection from bleeding with fewer doses. Emicizumab is an antibody given subcutaneously (under the skin) which performs the role of Factor VIII without actually replacing Factor VIII. As a result, it does not cause and is not affected by inhibitors. Other non-replacement therapies are also in development for hemophilia. Gene therapies trials are underway in both Hemophilia A and B, and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently approved the first gene therapy to treat adults with hemophilia B. The introduction of a functional gene that makes the body produce its own Factor VIII or Factor IX holds great promise of an eventual cure for the hemophilias. What if my child has symptoms or episodes of abnormal bleeding?  If your child at any age has mild bleeding symptoms, contact your pediatrician for a complete and thorough evaluation. If your child experiences severe bleeding symptoms, try to control the bleeding by applying pressure, and immediately contact your pediatrician or seek medical attention at your nearest emergency department.  Most children with bleeding symptoms will require additional consultation with a  pediatric hematologist . An evaluation for the causes of bleeding include a complete personal and family history, physical examination, and special blood testing.    Hemophilia Treatment Centers  are special federally funded clinics that provide current medications and supportive care to children and adults.

        "content": "Low or high blood sugar in a child with  diabetes  can cause loss of responsiveness. All of the cells in our body depend upon sugar in our blood as the main source of energy. This sugar comes from the foods that we eat. Certain organs in our body also make and store sugar.  When the body is working properly, it automatically regulates the amount of sugar in the blood. When there is too much sugar in the blood, the body makes  insulin , which lowers blood sugar. When blood sugar levels are too low, the body cuts back on the amount of insulin that it is making and lets the blood sugar levels rise. When blood sugar levels in the body are lower than normal, a child has hypoglycemia. Signs of hypoglycemia in a healthy child are usually mild, such as irritability. In a child with diabetes, hypoglycemia can lead to loss of responsiveness if not treated quickly. A diabetic child can get hypoglycemia if he doesn’t eat enough or doesn’t eat at the right time. He can get hypoglycemia if he takes too much insulin. Blood sugar levels may drop because of exercise, being overheated, or illness. A diabetic child may have too much sugar in the body. This is called hyperglycemia. It is the opposite of hypoglycemia. This condition may be caused by too little insulin, illness, or stress.

        "content": "Feelings of sadness, depression, or being overwhelmed may come and go for both you and your child. This is normal and healthy. As tumultuous as these times can be, most youngsters and their families emerge with few if any long-term behavioral problems or lasting psychological scars. In fact, the majority of children really do manage their situation well, despite riding an emotional roller coaster on occasion. Researchers believe that the likelihood of emo­tional and behavioral problems associated with chronic illness has been de­creasing recently because parents, school staffs, and health-care providers are learning more effective ways to help children and their parents meet their psy­chological needs.\t Nevertheless, children who have a chronic illness or condition often feel \"different,\" socially isolated, and restricted in their activities. They may have school problems and feel overprotected. They may experience recurrent fear and pain. When these emotional difficulties are not dealt with, they can lead to anxiety, sadness, withdrawal, rebelliousness, or a decreased interest in school.\t School-age children rarely state that they are sad or depressed. Instead, they may withdraw from friends and family or exhibit rebellious or angry be­havior. They may do poorly in school. They may interfere with their medical treatments, perhaps by refusing to take medication as scheduled. They might experiment with alcohol, drugs, or early sexual activity. Or they may run away from home or contemplate suicide.\t Make an ongoing effort to discuss with your child what he is experiencing. Do you think he is displaying signs of despair and hopelessness related to his illness and future? Encourage him to talk about these feelings with you or with another trusted adult. Because your child may not even be aware of his feel­ings, try beginning these conversations with statements like \"If I were you, I think I would be feeling...\" or \"I have read that many kids with this condition feel lonely and sad. How do you feel?\"\t Some parents are hesitant to discuss feelings about the disease with their child, in an effort to protect the youngster from emotional hurt. Most experts, however, disagree with that point of view. Children can usually adjust much better to an unpleasant truth than to the perception that their parents are up­set and hiding something from them. If parents and children do not talk openly, the opportunities for misinterpretation are high. A youngster's imagi­nation can run wild, and fears may emerge or be exaggerated.\t Thus, it is best to make a commitment to be as communicative as possible. Remind your child that he is not going through this alone and that you will re­main a constant source of love and support. Many studies show that the key to a  child's resilience  is a relationship with a caring, loving, accessible adult—someone the child can count on and trust.\t If you are concerned about your child's coping with these stresses, talk to your physician. If your youngster is exhibiting destructive or unusual behav­ior, if he refuses to take his medication, if he is severely withdrawn or if his schoolwork has deteriorated, your doctor might recommend some counseling for the child or the entire family.",

What do I need to tell the school?\t If your child has special health needs, the school should have a written document outlining a health care and emergency plan. \t The following information should be in the document:\t A brief medical history\t The child's special needs\t Medicine or procedures required during the school day\t Special dietary needs Transportation needs\t Possible problems, special precautions\t Pediatrician's name\t Emergency plans and procedures (including whom to contact)\t Once the school is informed a student has a  chronic health condition , a meeting is often scheduled to discuss what services may be needed. The meeting should include parents, the student (if old enough), school health staff, the coordinator of  special needs services , student aids, and the child's primary teacher. Health care providers, such as the child's pediatrician, also should be invited or asked to provide information in writing.\t One goal of this meeting is to develop a written plan that clearly describes the services the student needs. Depending on the child's needs, this plan may be described as a 504 Plan or an  Individualized Education Program (IEP) . This legal document outlines exactly what services the child will receive and sets short- and long-term goals for the child. The plan should be reviewed regularly to ensure it continues to meet the child's needs.\t Parent Responsibilities\t The following are ways you can help your child receive the education and services he or she needs to succeed in school:\t Talk to the school . Don't be afraid to tell the school about your child's condition. Some parents worry about sharing this information, but the more informed teachers and other school staff are, the better prepared they will be to help your child. If the school staff don't have all the facts, they may make wrong assumptions about your child's behavior or performance.\t Make an emergency plan . Ask your pediatrician to help you write down exactly what the school should do if your child has certain health needs. School staff should know how to reach you or your pediatrician in case there is an emergency. Remember to call the school right away when contact information has changed. \t Make a health plan . If your child takes medicine at school, ask about the school's policies for storage and self-usage. Make sure your child is able to take her medicine in a comfortable place, and that the school is provided with an adequate supply. Remember to call the school right away if there are any changes in your child's condition.\t Give your consent . You will have to sign a release form that gives the school permission to contact your pediatrician. Also, your pediatrician will need your written permission to discuss your child's condition with the school. If your child requires medicine or special procedures, the school must receive written instructions from your pediatrician.\t Plan ahead . Meet with your child's teachers regularly to talk about how your child is doing at school. Ask if your child's health condition is affecting her schoolwork or behavior. If your child is missing a lot of school due to illness, talk with her teacher about ways to help her keep up with her work. \t Know the Law\t By law, your child is entitled to an education that will help her develop to her full potential. Schools may be required to provide additional services that will assist in both in-school programs and after-school events. Federal laws such as the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)  and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) state that every child should be allowed to attend school in the \"least restrictive\" setting possible.",

        "content": "What are the steps for clean intermittent catheterization for girls and boys?\t If your child cannot empty his or her bladder completely, or has a problem with urine leakage, your child may need to start a catheterization program. These problems are commonly seen in children with spina bifida, spinal cord injuries, or some urinary tract defects. \t The following information explains the steps for CIC. This should not take the place of one-to-one teaching. If your child needs CIC, contact your pediatrician, doctor, or nurse practitioner for more information.\t CIC For Girls\t   First wash your hands with soap and water, then dry them. You also can use a waterless cleaner, such as an antibacterial cleanser that does not require water.\t Next have your box of supplies within easy reach.\t Place your daughter on her back or position her on the toilet or in her wheelchair. You should practice CIC in the position you will be using most often. If she is on the toilet, separate her legs widely enough to be able to clearly see her urethra. If she is doing her catheterizations herself, she will practice identifying her urethra by touch. When your daughter is learning to catheterize herself, she can use a mirror to see where her urethra is located.\t Clean your daughter's genitalia with a washcloth or disposable wipe.\t Separate the labia and wipe thoroughly from front to back.\t Place a generous amount of the water-soluble lubricant on the end of the catheter with the holes.\t Place the other end of the catheter into a container or let it drain into the toilet.\t Find your daughter's urethra. Gently insert the lubricated end of the catheter into the urethra about 2 to 3 inches. It may become slightly more difficult to insert just prior to entering the bladder. That is because a muscle called the sphincter sits at the opening of the bladder and is naturally tightly contracted. The sphincter will relax as you continue to gently insert the catheter until you reach the bladder and see urine flow.\t Once the catheter is in the bladder, hold it there until the urine flow stops. Then move the catheter slightly, or insert it a little more, to see if the flow continues. Gently press on your daughter's lower abdomen with your hand or ask your daughter to lean forward to be certain there is no more urine in the bladder.\t Slowly remove the catheter, holding your finger at the tip or pinching the catheter end before removing the final portion. Pull catheter out in a downward movement to prevent backflow of urine.\t Wash your hands. Clean and store your catheter as directed.\t CIC For Boys\t   First wash your hands with soap and water, then dry them. You also can use a waterless cleaner, such as an antibacterial cleanser that does not require water.\t Next have your box of supplies within easy reach.\t Place your son on his back or, if it is easier for both of you, have him sit on the toilet or in his wheelchair. If he is doing his own catheterization, he may stand or sit on the toilet or in his wheelchair. \t Clean the tip of his penis with a washcloth or disposable wipes in a circular motion starting at the center and working outward. If your son is uncircumcised, pull back the foreskin so that the tip of his penis is visible before cleansing.\t Place a generous amount of the water-soluble lubricant on the end of the catheter with the holes.\t Place the other end of the catheter into a container or let it drain into the toilet.\t Hold your son's penis upright. Gently insert the lubricated end of the catheter into the urethra about 4 to 6 inches until urine begins to flow. You may need to lower the penis as you continue to insert the catheter. It may become more difficult to advance the catheter as you get closer to the bladder. Do not worry, this is normal. Continue to gently insert the catheter with steady pressure until you feel the catheter slip into the bladder. Once urine flow begins, insert the catheter about an inch farther to allow the urine to flow better. \t Hold the catheter in place until the urine flow stops. You may gently press on your son's lower abdomen or ask him to squeeze his abdominal muscles or lean forward to be sure the bladder is empty.\t Remove the catheter once the urine flow stops completely. Hold your finger over the end of the catheter while removing it. This will prevent any urine in the tube from dripping out.\t If your son is uncircumcised, gently replace the foreskin over the end of his penis by pushing it forward.\t Wash your hands. Clean and store your catheter as directed.\t Supplies Needed\t It is best to have all of your supplies organized and ready when you need them. Keep the following items in a clean, dry container such as a plastic shoe box or cosmetic case.\t   Catheters . Your doctor will give you a prescription for the appropriate catheter size for your child.\t Disposable wipes or a washcloth . Your child's genitalia will need to be cleaned before CIC.\t Lubricant . Use only a water-soluble lubricant. You can buy the lubricant at pharmacies or drug stores. Do not use oil-based lubricants such as petroleum jelly because they do not dissolve in water.\t Container . You may need a container to drain the urine into if you are not doing the catheterizations on the toilet, or if you need to keep a record of how much your child drains.\t Syringe . You will need a syringe for cleaning the catheter.",

        "content": "Denial\t An example of denial in action is the teen with diabetes who wolfs down two pieces of birthday cake at a party, knowing full well that she’s going to regret it later; or the young person with hemophilia who insists on performing daredevil stunts on his dirt bike. But suppressing the reality of a health condition is also an effective coping strategy that allows people to go on living productively. Denial becomes a problem only when it leads to dangerous outcomes.\t Intellectualization\t This defense mechanism, seen mainly with younger adolescents, consists of  partial  denial. The teenager accepts her condition and often exhibits a firstyear medical student’s knowledge about it, but chooses to block out how she  feels  about it. Intellectualization can be useful when employed as a delay tactic; it gives the young patient time to sort out and deal with her emotions. But if it persists, the adolescent never truly comes to grips with her situation. She may also fall into a pattern of shutting out all uncomfortable feelings, at which point intervention from a health-care professional is certainly warranted.\t Regression\t When the going gets tough, even the most outwardly stoic youth may revert to childish behavior. Regression provides temporary escape from stressful situations. The proper parental response? Be firm about what you will and will not tolerate, but show plenty of caring and patience. In time, the young person will learn to cope with his circumstances in a more mature fashion.\t Acting-Out Behavior\t This is another short-term survival tool, frequently wielded like a battering ram. Defiance, combativeness and testing limits at home and at school are all expressions of a teenager’s anger and depression over his predicament:  I’m  furious  that I have this stupid disease! And even though I know it’s irrational, Mom and Dad, sometimes I can’t help venting my rage in your direction.  Acting-out behavior can be hurtful to anyone who stumbles into its path. It may also manifest in self-destructive ways, such as poor performance in school, experimenting with substances and/or sex and run-ins with the law. Involving a mental-health expert from the beginning can help to prevent things from spinning out of control.",

        "content": "What is cystic fibrosis?\t Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that changes the secretions of certain glands in the body. It is inherited from parents who carry the gene that cause this disease. For a child to get cystic fibrosis, both parents must be carriers of the gene that causes it. Although the sweat glands and the glandular cells of the lungs and pancreas are affected most often, the sinuses, liver, intestines, and reproductive organs also can be involved. \t Great progress has been made in treating this disease and its symptoms, but there is still no cure. However, children with CF are living longer, thanks to the scientific progress that has occurred. \t Who Gets CF?\t For a child to get cystic fibrosis, both parents must be carriers of the gene that causes it. In the United States, CF is most common in the Caucasian population, where 1 out of every 20 people is a carrier, and 1 of every 2,000 to 3,000 Caucasian babies have CF. The disease is much less common in African Americans (1 in 17,000 live births) and Hispanics (1 in 11,500 live births), and even rarer among Asians. \t About 60,000 children and adults worldwide have been diagnosed with CF; approximately half of them (30,000) are in North America. In 1989 researchers discovered the gene that causes CF. Couples planning to have children can undergo genetic testing and counseling to find out if they are carrying the CF gene.\t Signs and Symptoms\t The majority of CF cases are diagnosed within the first two years of life; in many states, newborn screenings now include mandatory testing for CF. (CF can be diagnosed even before the baby is born with genetic testing as well as through detection of an abnormality found on an ultrasound in the later stages of pregnancy). Your pediatrician may suspect CF if your child is failing to gain weight, which often accompanies this disease. Other signs and symptoms vary with the degree of the involvement of organs like the lungs.\t More than half of the cases of CF are diagnosed because of repeated lung infections. These infections tend to recur because mucus in the airways is thicker than normal and more difficult to cough out. A child with CF is likely to have a persistent cough that gets worse with colds. Since the secretions of the lungs remain in the airways longer than normal, the airways are more likely to become infected, increasing the chances of pneumonia or bronchitis. Over time, these lung infections cause damage to the lungs, and are the major cause of death in CF. Diabetes and chronic liver disease are other complications that may occur in children with CF.\t Most children with CF are deficient in digestive enzymes, making it difficult for them to digest fats and proteins as well as they should. As a result, these children have large, bulky, foul-smelling stools. Loose stools may result from an inability to digest formula or food, and are one of the causes of the child’s failure to gain weight. \t Diagnosis\t To confirm the diagnosis, your pediatrician will order a  sweat test  to measure the amount of salt your child loses as he perspires. Children with cystic fibrosis have much more salt in their sweat than do children who do not have CF. Two or more of these tests may be required to ensure an accurate diagnosis, since the results are not always clearly positive or negative. If your child is diagnosed as having the disease, your pediatrician will help you get the additional specialized medical help that is necessary.\t Treatment\t Treatment of CF’s lung infections is the most important aspect of your child’s care. The goal is to help clear the thick secretions from your youngster’s lungs, which may involve various techniques that help him cough out the sputum more easily. The lung infections themselves are treated with antibiotics. Periods in which the lung infections worsen are called exacerbations, which are associated with more coughing and sputum production, and may require treatment with the use of intravenous antibiotics.\t To treat the lack of digestive enzymes in CF, your child will be prescribed capsules containing enzymes to be taken with every meal and every snack. The amount of enzymes is based on the level of fat in the diet and the weight of your child. Once the correct amount of enzymes is taken, your youngster’s stool pattern will become more normal and he’ll begin gaining more weight. He also will need to take supplemental vitamins.\t Emotional Burden of CF\t Because CF is a hereditary disease, many parents feel guilty about their child’s illness. However, CF is a genetic disease that is no one’s fault, so there’s no reason to blame anyone. Instead, you should channel your emotional energies into your child’s treatment.\t It is important to raise your child as you would if he did not have this disease. There is no reason to limit his educational or career goals. The majority of children with CF can expect to grow up and lead productive adult lives. Your child needs both love and discipline, and should be encouraged to develop and test his limits. \t Balancing the physical and emotional demands created by this disease is hard on both the CF patient and his family, so it is very important that you get as much support as possible. Ask your pediatrician to put you in touch with the nearest CF center and CF support groups. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation also can be of help.",

I ached so bad and I felt so angry.\"\t Parents often experience an array of emotions as they come to terms with their youngster's illness. Immediately after the diagnosis, many mothers and fathers enter a mourning period, grieving over the \"loss\" of their healthy child. They must cope with the shock and the pain and try to accept the new reality of having a youngster with a chronic illness. Parents often deny this reality and tell themselves things like \"This can't be happening... The laboratory must have gotten our test results mixed up with someone else's. When am I going to wake up from this nightmare?\" Eventually, parents usually begin to find ways to accept their child's illness, despite periodically feeling sad, resentful, anxious, and angry.\t Common Feelings of Parents of Children with Chronic Illnesses\t Guilt is common among parents, often feeling that they somehow caused the illness. Self-blame is particularly prevalent when the condition was present at birth, has a genetic basis, and/or when the cause is not known. Guilt can be an excruciating and disabling emotion, adding to the stress within the family and sometimes making it difficult for parents to be supportive of their children and each other. If guilt or other emotional difficulties are interfering with your par­enting abilities or the quality of your family life, you may benefit from some professional counseling.\t \t \t \t \t \t  Negative\t Positive\t   Anger\t Achievement\t   Anxiety\t Closeness\t   Embarrassment\t Joy\t   Frustration\t Love\t   Grief\t Mastery\t   Guilt\t Pride\t   Isolation\t Self-Confidence\t   Powerlessness\t Self-Esteem\t   Resentment\t Strength\t   Sadness\t Usefulness\t Other adjustments may be necessary as well. There can be considerable fi­nancial cost associated with a child's chronic illness. As medical bills mount—with frequent doctors' visits, medications, hospitalizations, and other outpatient services—worry over finances can intensify.\t Many parents find it to be very difficult to discipline their chronically ill child. However, all children need and benefit from having clear limits and consistent expectations. In their absence, children may become overly de­pendent, have lower self-esteem, and begin to have behavioral and social problems. Parents should establish a consistent set of expectations, adjusting them as needed for acute episodes as the child's health fluctuates. They should provide an environment that encourages independence and self-confidence.\t Sometimes a parent may have to give up a career or education to become the primary caretaker at home; this is particularly true when the child re­quires a great deal of assistance with daily activities. A parent may have to change jobs, or take on a second job, to increase the family income. These ad­justments are sometimes complicated when a new job necessitates switching health insurance policies, causing a situation in which medical bills associated with the child's chronic illness (referred to as a  pre-existing condition)  are not covered. The family might also have to move, relocating closer to the medical services the child needs.\t Several state and federal programs are available to help families with the costs of chronic health care. Recent changes in the eligibility criteria for Sup­plemental Security Income (SSI) for children, for example, now provide cash benefits to many families with children with chronic illnesses. Eligible young­sters generally include those with significant psychiatric conditions and se­vere chronic illnesses, such as cystic fibrosis, congenital heart disease, malignancies, and many others. Your physician or the social worker at your lo­cal hospital should be able to refer you to the proper agencies for help.",

        "content": "​Diabetes mellitus is a chronic medical condition that causes problems with the body's ability to change food--especially sugars (carbohydrates)--into fuel for the body. High blood glucose from not properly treating the diabetes can damage the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, eyes and nervous system over many years. Forms of diabetes The two most common forms of diabetes are called  type 1  and  type 2  diabetes. Both forms can occur at any age, but children are more likely to be diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes \t Type 1 diabetes  occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough of a hormone called insulin. This stops the body from being able to use sugar, which then build up in the bloodstream. These sugars (also called glucose) that cannot be used by the body pass out of the body in the urine and take water with it.  While type 1 diabetes can begin at any age, there are peak periods at about ages 5 to 6 and then again at ages 11 to 13. Often a first sign is an increase in the how often a child urinates, especially at night, and may cause a child who is potty trained to start    bedwetting  again. There are other key symptoms as well, for example, being very thirsty and tired, losing weight, and an increased appetite. ​Identifying symptoms of type 1 diabetes early is important. High blood sugar levels and  dehydration  caused by uncontrolled diabetes is dangerous and can cause children to need intravenous insulin and fluids in a pediatric  emergency room  or critical care unit.​ ​ Type 2 diabetes\t Type 2 diabetes  was once called “adult onset\" diabetes, because children hardly ever got it. With rising rates of childhood obesity, however,    a growing number of children  are being diagnosed with this form of the disease—some as young as 10 years old. In addition to weight problems, other risk factors for type 2 diabetes in children include having a family member with the disease, and being born to a mother with diabetes while pregnant (gestational diabetes), or other medical problems that affect the way the body handles insulin. Symptoms are similar to type 1 diabetes and may show up gradually. Darkened areas of skin, especially around the neck or in the armpits, are also common.  Controlling and managing diabetes Although there is no cure for diabetes, children with this disease can lead normal lives if it's kept under control. Managing the disease focuses on blood sugar monitoring, treatment such as  insulin therapy , given as multiple injections per day or through an insulin pump, and maintaining a  healthy diet . Keeping blood sugars within a normal range re­duces is important and lowers the risk of long-term health problems related to poor diabetes control. In addition to a healthy diet, at least thirty minutes of  exercise  a day can help children man­age their disease as well. What parents of children with diabetes can do As your child becomes more independent, you can help them learn to take more responsibility for caring for their diabetes. Children above the age of 7 typically have the fine motor skills to be able to start giving them­selves insulin injections with adult supervision. They can also check the sugar in their blood several times per day, using simple, chemically treated test strips and a blood sugar meter.  However, these self-care tasks need your supervision to make certain their diabetes stays under control according to your doctor's guidelines.\t If your child takes too much insulin:  their blood sugar can become too low (hypoglycemia). This can lead to trembling, a rapid heartbeat, nausea, fatigue, weakness, and even loss of consciousness.\t If your child takes too little insulin:  the major symptoms of dia­betes (weight loss, increased urination, thirst, and appetite), can return.  Developing good diabetes management habits when a child is young can have a dramatic impact on their management habits as they get older. Many communities also have active parent groups that share and discuss common concerns. Ask your doctor for a recommendation.  Remember Regular    check-ups  are especially important to identify and treat diabetes in children as early as possible. Talk with your pediatrician if you have any concerns about your child's health.

        "content": "Parents in the throes of caring for a sick child, may not have that child's future fertility and sexual function top of mind. However, a number of pediatric conditions and treatments can impact a child's sexual function and ability to have future children of their own.  If you have a child with a chronic health condition, talk with your child's doctors about these issues early so you understand the risks, if any, and options available. Some questions to ask may include:  Does my child's condition pose risks for their future fertility or sexual function? Will any of the treatments my child is undergoing today affect his or her future fertility or sexual function?  Is there anything we should do now to protect or preserve my child's fertility or sexual function?  What information can I share with my child about future fertility or sexual function?  Tips for Talking with Your Child About Reproductive Health Issues: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) clinical report,     \t Counseling in Pediatric Populations at Risk for Infertility and/or Sexual Function Concerns , explains how and why to have ongoing and developmentally appropriate conversations with your child about the potential for future infertility and sexual dysfunction.  Withholding information is not recommended. Studies in women with Turner syndrome, for example, show that a lack of communication about their condition can create tremendous distress later in life when infertility is discovered. The topic of future parenthood can and should be discussed in an age-appropriate manner.      See \t   Talking to Your Young Child About Sex  for additional tips.\t Parents of infants/very young children:  While fertility preservation options for infants and young children are experimental, it is important to know your options. Educate yourself. New fertility-related technologies and medical and surgical approaches to preserve or improve sexual function may emerge. Talk with your child's health care team and connect with other families who have had similar experiences. \t School-aged children:  Encourage your child to ask questions. Although detailed            discussions about sex  may not be appropriate at this age, children should feel comfortable asking about their bodies at home and at doctors' visits. You might say,            \"How are you feeling about your body?\"  You might also try introducing the topic by saying,  \"There are many different ways to become a parent and have a family.\"  Check in with your child periodically as he or she grows and matures to see how much he or she understands, since awareness of fertility and sexuality increases with age. \t Adolescents and young adults:  Like any teenager, your child may struggle with long-term decision making. However, he or she may wonder and worry about the impact of fertility and sexual impairment on future dating and forming romantic relationships. Be aware that your child may be more comfortable discussing these topics in private with his or her doctors―but parents can still be involved in  decision making. \t Ask your child open-ended questions ,               but be specific about fertility, family building, and sexual function/health . These can be awkward conversations. Plain and simple. Try to create a safe and comfortable environment for discussions. Relevant topics may include anatomy, masturbation, erections, nocturnal emissions, sexual fantasies, sexual orientation, orgasms, sensation, and performance.\t Do not assume your child is not involved in romantic relationships just because he or she has a chronic condition . Encourage your child to be open and honest with others about his or her illness if it is transmittable or requires daily or ongoing care. How the chronic illness may affect fertility or how it could be passed on to offspring should also be discussed. As your child enters young adulthood, accepting his or her own medical condition will be a key factor in his or her ability to disclose disease status to others.\t Emphasize that it is still important to practice safe sex―even if your child is likely to be infertile . While potential infertility may cause distress and anxiety, unplanned pregnancies do happen among those who incorrectly assumed they were infertile. Contraception should be used to prevent unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including human papillomavirus infection. \t Provide your with child psychosocial support . Teens with chronic conditions may need the help of a mental health professional to come to terms with their condition. It may take time for them to fully understand how their illness can impact relationships, intimacy, and self-esteem.

Preserving Your Child's Fertility: Technology to preserve fertility for future use―known as fertility preservation―is an emerging, evolving field and includes \"freezing\" sperm and eggs or preserving testicular or ovarian tissue.  Fertility preservation options are currently limited for infants and children who have not yet reached puberty, as well as those with fertility altering conditions such as genetic conditions and differences/disorders of sex development.  More Research is Needed:  Fertility impairment and sexual dysfunction can have a significant effect on quality of life. It can be challenging, at times, to find credible information about these topics; there is little research available on reproductive and sexual health outcomes for many conditions. Some examples include cancer treatments, hematologic or autoimmune conditions requiring bone marrow transplantation, renal and rheumatologic disorders in which alkylators are used, gender affirming hormonal therapy used in the care of transgender youth, differences/disorders of sex development, and other genetic syndromes such as galactosemia.      (See table below).   When possible, the AAP recommends helping children who may have preservation options, in a timely fashion and educating them on their fertility status, options down the road, and about sexual function and reproductive health in general.  Additional Information:\t The Stresses Faced by Teenagers Who Are Chronically Ill or Disabled\t Children with Chronic Illness: Dealing with Emotional Problems and Depression\t Preconception Counseling for Women with a Congenital Heart Defect\t The Oncofertility Consortium  - Overview of fertility preservation, includes information on some nonmalignant conditions as well",

        "content": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) is an umbrella term used to describe the range of effects that can occur in an individual with prenatal alcohol exposure. These effects can have lifelong implications including physical, mental, behavior, and/or learning issues.  The exact number of children who have an FASD is difficult to determine. Some experts estimate that approximately 40,000 babies may be born with an FASD in the United States each year. Based on studies of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others, it is estimated that in the United States, somewhere between 800 and 8,000 babies could be born each year with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).  Conditions on the FASD Spectrum The term FASD encompasses a number of conditions: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) FAS is on the most severe end of the FASD spectrum. It describes people with the greatest alcohol effects, causing signs and symptoms so distinct that the diagnosis is based on special measurements and findings in each of the 3 following areas: Three specific facial abnormalities: smooth philtrum (the area between nose and upper lip), thin upper lip, small palpebral fissures (the horizontal eye openings) Growth deficit (lower than average height, weight or both) Central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities (structural, neurologic, functional, or a combination of these) Partial fetal Alcohol Syndrome (pFAS) When a person does not meet the full diagnostic criteria for FAS but has a history of prenatal alcohol exposure and some of the facial abnormalities, as well as a growth problem or CNS abnormalities that person is considered to have partial FAS (pFAS). Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND) People with ARND do not have abnormal facial features or growth problems, but do have problems with how their brain and nervous system were formed as well as how they function. These individuals may have: Intellectual disabilities Behavior or learning problems Nerve or brain abnormalities In particular, a 2011 federally convened committee that reviewed the science noted that these children are most likely to have problems with  neurocognitive development, adaptive functioning, and or behavior regulation. Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated with Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (ND-PAE) In addition to confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure, these individuals have impairment of neurocognition, self-regulation, and adaptive functioning. ND-PAE combines deficits is these three areas in conjunction with the following: Evidence of prenatal alcohol exposure Childhood onset of symptoms Significant distress or impairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important area of function Alcohol-Related Birth Defects (ARBD) People with ARBD have problems with how some of their organs were formed and or how they function, including: Heart Kidney Bones (possibly the spine) Hearing Vision These individuals also may have one of the other FASDs. Cause FASDs can happen only when a pregnant woman consumes alcohol. The alcohol crosses the placenta and enters the baby's blood where it can damage the developing brain and other organs leading to an FASD. FASDs are 100% preventable if a woman does not drink alcohol during pregnancy. Diagnosis  It is difficult to diagnosis FASDs, because there is no single or simple test that can cover the broad range of FASD signs and symptoms. Certain physical findings, developmental problems, behavioral concerns, or  school failure  should trigger the parents and or the pediatric medical home provider or other  pediatric developmental specialist  to consider FASDs as potential diagnoses, especially in the context of exposure to prenatal alcohol. A known history of alcohol consumption during the pregnancy aids in diagnosis but is not required for diagnosis of an FASD.  Children with an FASD can have brain abnormalities that lead to problems in day-to-day functioning despite having a normal IQ, so a comprehensive evaluation is indicated. All children with involvement in foster care or adoption processes―especially  international adoptions ―should always be evaluated for a possible FASD. Treatment No one treatment is right for every child, as FASD and its constellation of symptoms differ from one child to another. FASDs need a medical home to provide, coordinate, and facilitate all the necessary medical, behavioral, social, and educational services.  Many types of available treatments include but are not limited to: Developmental services Educational interventions Behavior modification Parent training Social skills training Medications and other medical therapies Transition planning Advocacy in school and the workplace Referral for community support services Coordination across the specialists, partners, and needed supports Primary care in a high quality medical home setting with care integration Treatment plans should be adaptable to the child's and family's needs, plus include close monitoring and follow-up.  Outlook for Children with FASDs FASDs last a lifetime. There is no cure for FASDs, but identifying children with FASDs as early as possible can help them reach their potential. Research has shown that early identification and enrollment in treatment can significantly improve an affected child's development and life.

        "content": "By: Vincent C. Smith, MD, MPH, FAAP & Renee Turchi, MD, MPH, FAAP If you're expecting a baby, it is important to avoid drinking alcohol. Read on to learn why, and find answers to common questions parents may have about drinking during pregnancy.  How does alcohol harm the developing fetus? Alcohol is a \"teratogen,\" something known to cause abnormalities in a fetus after prenatal exposure. Alcohol consumed by a pregnant person can reach the fetus and interfere with development of the brain and other body organs. A child exposed to alcohol before birth may face a lifetime of challenges from what are called fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. What are fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs)? The term    fetal alcohol spectrum disorders , or FASDs, describes a broad group of conditions that result from prenatal alcohol exposure. People with FASDs have a combination of physical, developmental, behavioral and learning challenges that range from mild to severe. Each person with an FASD has their own unique combination of signs and symptoms. The term FASD includes all of the following conditions: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) Partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS) Alcohol-related birth defects (ARBDs) Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) Neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE) How common is prenatal alcohol exposure? Children with prenatal alcohol exposure come from every social, economic, racial, and ethnic group. In the United States, nearly    1 in 7 pregnant people report  alcohol use in the past 30 days. How to prevent FASDs FASDs are 100% preventable. The only sure way to prevent FASDs is to completely avoid alcohol use while pregnant. Because damage from prenatal alcohol exposure can occur even during the earliest weeks of pregnancy, often before someone realizes they are pregnant, people who are trying to get pregnant or who could get pregnant also should avoid alcohol. There is    no amount  of alcohol during pregnancy that is risk-free There is    no kind  of alcohol during pregnancy that is risk-free There is    no time  during pregnancy when alcohol consumption is risk-free What is considered \"a drink\"?\t In the United States, a \"standard drink\" is defined for as any alcoholic beverage that contains 0.6 fluid ounces (14 g) of pure alcohol. In general, the means 12 oz of beer, 4 oz glass of wine, or 1 oz shot of hard liquor are each one standard drink. Mixed drinks or alcohol served in restaurants/bars often contain more than one standard drink. Is there any safe amount of alcohol consumption during pregnancy?\t There is no safe amount of alcohol when a person is pregnant.  Research evidence indicates that even drinking small amounts of alcohol while pregnant can lead to: Miscarriage Stillbirth Prematurity Sudden infant death syndrome Does more drinking during pregnancy cause more harm? The more alcohol a developing fetus is exposed to, the higher the risk is for the developing fetus to have alcohol-related brain and organ damage. Binge drinking (having four or more drinks at one time) is the worst pattern of drinking. However, even low to moderate amounts of alcohol can have adverse effects on the developing fetus's brain and organs. Thus, the best advice is to avoid prenatal alcohol exposure. Is there any kind of alcohol that is safe to drink during pregnancy?\t There is no safe type of alcoholic beverage to consume while pregnant.  For example, red wine is no safer than white wine, beer, or mixed drinks, since all contain alcohol. Is there a safe time during pregnancy when you can drink alcohol?\t No, there is no point during pregnancy when drinking alcohol is considered safe.  Harmful effects from alcohol can happen at the earliest stages of pregnancy to the developing fetal brain—even before someone realizes they are pregnant. Because different aspects of the child are developing at all stages of pregnancy, alcohol's effects on a developing baby can result from alcohol use at any point during pregnancy. Alcohol is a known neurotoxin and the brain develops throughout pregnancy, thus the developing brain and nervous system are always at risk. Can a partner's use of alcohol lead to FASDs? No, a partner's use of alcohol cannot lead to FASDs. FASDs can only happen when a pregnant person consumes alcohol. There is some literature that suggests a sperm produced by a partner who drinks alcohol can have changes (i.e. epigenetic alterations) that could affect the developing fetus, but this science is still in the earliest stages at this time. However, it is important for the father of the baby or the supportive partner to encourage the pregnant person to abstain from alcohol throughout the pregnancy. What do I do if I did not know I was pregnant and have been drinking?\t Stop drinking as soon as you find out you are pregnant.  This is the best thing you can do for yourself and your baby. In general, babies born to expectant parents who stop drinking do better than babies of those who continue to drink alcohol. In addition, make sure you get regular prenatal checkups and discuss your alcohol use with your healthcare provider. Don't hesitate to ask for advice, especially if you think you might have difficulty stopping your use of alcohol. A wide variety of referrals and resources are available.    Please see below . If I drank when I was pregnant, does that mean my baby will have an FASD? Not necessarily, because every pregnancy is different. Which babies will be affected from prenatal alcohol exposure varies based on genetics, nutrition, environmental factors and exposure to other substances like cigarette smoking. It is hard to predict which babies will be affected and how severely they will be affected from prenatal exposure to alcohol. Discuss your FASD concerns with your child's health care provider and be sure to be honest about your alcohol usage. There is no blame or judgment, you just want to have your baby get the care they need. Is it okay to drink alcohol if I am trying to get pregnant?\t No, it is not okay to drink alcohol while trying to get pregnant.  When someone is trying to get pregnant, they might already be pregnant and not know it for up to 4 to 6 weeks. This means that if they are drinking alcohol, they are also exposing their fetus to all the alcohol-related risks. They are also raising the risk for other adverse reproductive outcomes such as miscarriage. So, the best advice is to stop drinking when you start trying to get pregnant. See   \t Alcohol and Pregnancy: It's Just Not Worth the Risk . Why should I worry about alcohol use if I am not pregnant and not trying to get pregnant? Half of all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned. The best way to prevent unplanned pregnancies beyond abstinence is by consistently using effective    birth control . Can my child get an FASD if I drink while breastfeeding?\t No, because FASDs are the result of prenatal alcohol exposure.  Still, it is a good idea to    limit alcohol consumption while providing breast milk  to your baby because alcohol can pass through your milk to your baby. Remember, brain development continues after birth and occurs throughout childhood. Drinking beer does not increase your milk supply, as urban myth suggests. In fact, consuming alcohol of any kind may decrease the amount of milk your baby drinks. Alcohol can change the taste of your milk, and this may be objectionable to some babies.\t If you are going to have an alcohol containing beverage, it is best to do so just after you nurse or pump milk rather than before. Breastfeeding or pumping breast milk is ok 4 hours after your last drink.  That way, your body will have as much time as possible to rid itself of the alcohol before the next feeding and less will reach your infant. There are concerns about long-term, repeated exposures of infants to alcohol via breast milk, so moderation is advised. Frequent consumption of alcohol may also reduce milk production. How are FASDs diagnosed? Diagnosing FASDs can be difficult because there is no single or simple test that can cover the broad range of FASD signs and symptoms. A pediatric medical home provider and/or other pediatric or developmental specialists usually make the FASD diagnosis after one or more appropriate evaluations. Be sure to ask your pediatrician if you are worried that your child may have an FASD and need further evaluation. Certain physical findings, developmental problems, behavioral concerns, or school failure should trigger the parents and the pediatric medical home to consider FASDs as potential diagnoses. Children with an FASD can have brain abnormalities that lead to problems in day-to-day functioning despite having a normal IQ, so a comprehensive evaluation is indicated. Some common issues for children with FASDs are learning and memory impairment, poor self-regulation (including co-diagnosis of ADHD) and trouble with planning and organization. Children with involvement in foster care or adoption processes―especially international adoptions―should always be evaluated for a possible FASD. Is there a cure for FASDs?\t FASDs last a lifetime. There is no cure for FASDs, but identifying children with FASDs as early as possible can help them reach their potential.  Research has shown that early identification and enrollment in treatment can significantly improve an affected child's development and life. Are there treatments that help with FASDs?\t Treatments have been shown to help, but no one treatment is right for every child since one FASD differs from another.  FASDs need a medical home to provide, coordinate, and facilitate all the necessary medical, behavioral, social and educational services. Many types of FASD treatment are available, including: Developmental services Educational interventions Behavior modification Parent training Social skills training Medications and other medical therapies Transition planning Advocacy in school and the workplace Referral for community support services Coordination across the specialists, partners, and needed supports Primary care in a high-quality medical home setting with care integration Treatment plans should be adaptable to the child's and family's needs, plus include close monitoring and follow-up. Are FASDs genetic or hereditary? There is no evidence that FASDs are genetic or hereditary. FASDs can only happen if someone consumes alcohol while they are pregnant. A person who has an FASD does not have greater risk of having a child with an FASD unless they consume alcohol during their pregnancy. However, individuals with FASDs are at increased risk for substance use and other secondary conditions associated with FASDs. For these reasons, someone who has an FASD themselves can indeed be at increased risk for having a child with an FASD. What if my doctor tells me it is okay to drink during pregnancy? Your doctor is not giving you advice based on the best and most recent research available. Every major medical organization in the United States, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the US Surgeon General, and the CDC, agree and consistently state that the best advice is for people not to drink alcohol while they are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. There is    no amount  of alcohol during pregnancy that is risk-free. There is    no type  of alcohol during pregnancy that is risk-free. There is    no time  during pregnancy when alcohol consumption is risk-free. What if my biological child is diagnosed with an FASD? Discuss all your questions and concerns with your child's medical home provider and other specialists caring for your child. You may need reassurance as a parent and benefit from greater personal and emotional support. There may be a support group to which your child's doctor can refer you, or you can find one through your community, church, or school system. The FASD United has a    Circle of Hope/Birth Mother's Network  that can be contacted in person or online. Any continued alcohol use should be discussed regarding your own safety and that of future pregnancies. I've tried in the past to stop drinking alcohol, but I just couldn't do it. Where can I get help? If you cannot stop drinking, talk with your doctor or contact local Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) groups or a local alcohol counselor or treatment center. AA is a cost-free fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength, and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcohol use disorder. Locate an AA program near you by visiting    www.aa.org . The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has a treatment facility locator. This locator helps people find drug and alcohol use treatment programs in their area. Visit    https://findtreatment.gov/ . The FASD United Family Navigator program provides resources and services to individuals, family members, or caregivers living with alcohol or other substance use disorders. Visit https://fasdunited.org/family-navigator/ for more information.  What about marijuana and vaping during pregnancy? The AAP also advises against using tobacco, e-cigarettes, marijuana, and other harmful substances during pregnancy:\t No amount  of marijuana has been proven safe to use during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.\t No type of e-cigarette ―also known as e-hookah, e-pens, vape pens, or tanks―is safe to use while pregnant or while breastfeeding. E-cigarettes are NOT a safe way to quit smoking during pregnancy either.

Even children with a serious chronic disease can enjoy the benefits of participating in safe and appropriate physical activity.\t Talk with your pediatrician about whether restrictions are necessary for your child with a chronic illness; if they are, explain the situation fully to your youngster before imposing them. Obviously, she should not be in an athletic environment where her limitations place her in danger or significantly limit her opportunity to have some success. Nearly every child can find an appropriate level of activity in which she can participate successfully and without frustration, while developing muscle strength and coordination. Every child should be encouraged to become as active as possible.\t Most chronic health problems actually require few, if any, restrictions. Chil­dren with asthma, for example, can usually participate in sports, although they may have to follow carefully their doctor's guidelines for medication ad­ministration before exercising. Youngsters with well-controlled seizure disor­ders can enjoy nearly all sports, from baseball to basketball to soccer— although if a child has occasional seizures, it is probably sensible to avoid ac­tivities such as rope climbing, high diving, and workouts on parallel bars, where a fall could cause a serious injury; while swimming, these children should be supervised by an adult who is in the water with them.\t Children with heart disease or high blood pressure can participate in most sports, although your child's cardiologist may have specific recommendations about how strenuous an activity should be. Youngsters with musculoskeletal problems like scoliosis can also lead an active life, as can most children with rheumatoid arthritis.\t Some youngsters have impaired, uncorrectable vision in one eye. In these cases, talk to an ophthalmologist about protecting the good eye from injury. Special protective eyewear may be suggested. Children who participate in sports where eyes are frequently injured, such as baseball, racquetball, and handball, are also advised to use protective eyewear.\t The Special Olympics program offers unique, exciting experiences for dis­abled children, providing opportunities for physical fitness, competition, and enjoyment. Through their participation, children can enhance their self-esteem, and parents can connect with a valuable support system.",

        "content": "Influenza ( flu ) is an infection of the nose, throat and lungs caused by the influenza viruses. It can cause mild to severe illness, pneumonia, and other complications.  Children younger than age 5, but especially children younger than 2 years old, and children and adolescents with chronic health conditions are at greater risk for serious flu complications. These flu complications can result in hospital stays and even death. The best way to prevent the flu is by getting a flu vaccine each year.  How do I know if my child is at greater risk for flu-related complications?     Your child is at higher risk if they have any of the following conditions:  Asthma  Neurological and neurodevelopmental conditions including disorders of the brain; spinal cord; peripheral nerve and muscle. Examples include cerebral palsy, epilepsy ( seizure  disorders), stroke, intellectual disability, moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy or spinal cord injury  Chronic lung disease (such as cystic fibrosis, or chronic lung disease of prematurity)  Heart disease (such as  congenital heart disease  and congestive heart failure)  Blood disorders (such as  sickle cell disease )  Endocrine disorders (such as  diabetes  mellitus)  Kidney  disorders  Liver disorders  Obesity  (childhood obesity is defined as a  body-mass index  at or above the 95th percentile, for age and sex) Metabolic disorders (such as inherited metabolic disorders and mitochondrial disorders) Weakened immune system due to disease or medication (such as children or adolescents with  HIV or AIDS ,  cancer , bone marrow or solid organ transplantation or those on chronic steroids or other immune suppressive treatment) Receiving long-term aspirin therapy for chronic disorders Pregnancy What are symptoms of the flu? \t Symptoms of the flu can include: Fever* Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Body aches Headache Chills Fatigue Sometimes vomiting and diarrhea *It is important to note that some people sick with flu may not have a fever.  What is a flu complication?  Most people who get the flu will recover in a few days to less than 2 weeks, but some people will develop complications because of the flu, some of which can be life-threatening and result in death. Pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinus and ear infections are examples of complications from the flu. The flu can also make chronic health conditions worse. For example, people with asthma may experience asthma attacks while they have the flu. How can I protect my child against the flu? \t Flu vaccines:  The most important thing is for your child to get a flu vaccine every year. Children younger than 6 months are at high risk of serious flu illness, but are too young to be vaccinated. People who care for them should be vaccinated instead in order to protect them. When a pregnant woman is vaccinated, the antibody produced in response to the vaccine also offers protection to the developing baby.\t Distance:  Your child should avoid close contact with people who are sick.\t Hand washing:  Wash hands  often with soap and running water (as long as it takes to sing the \"Happy Birthday\" song twice). If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Help your child wash their hands if needed.\t Germ control:  Encourage your child to avoid touching their eyes, nose, mouth, and to use a tissue or elbow to cough or sneeze into. \t Cleaning:  Keep surfaces in the house and toys clean by wiping them down with a household    disinfectant  according to the directions on the product label.\t Health:  If your child has a chronic health condition, make sure that it is under the best control.\t Plan:  Have a plan in case your child becomes sick with the flu. What can I do if my child gets sick?\t Doctor:  Call or take your child to the doctor if your child develops flu-like symptoms. The doctor may want to begin antiviral drugs as quickly as possible. Antiviral drugs are prescription medicines that fight against the flu in your body.\t Home care:  Excluding doctor visits, keep your child at home until they no longer have a fever for at least 24 hours and are feeling more like themselves.\t Covering coughs:  Ensure that your child covers coughs and sneezes. \t Rest and fluids:  Make sure your child gets plenty of rest and drinks fluids to keep them from becoming dehydrated.\t Medicines:  Ask your doctor about fever-reducing medicines based on your child's age. Children younger than 4 years of age should not be given over-the-counter cough/cold medicines without approval from a health care provider. Aspirin should not be given to children or teenagers who have the flu; this can cause a rare but serious illness called Reye's syndrome. Remember that the fever helps your child fight the infection, so it is not always necessary to give fever-reducing medicines.\t Sick room:  Keep your sick child in a separate room (sick room) in the house. Limit as much contact as possible with other members of the household who are not sick. Make one person in the house the main caregiver for the sick child.\t Protect pregnant women:  Pregnant women should get a flu shot. If possible, pregnant women should not be the main caregivers of a child with the flu until they recover. When can my child go back to school after being sick? Usually, your child should stay home for at least 24 hours after the fever is gone. A fever is defined as 100.4° F/38.3° C or greater. The fever should be gone without the use of a fever-reducing medicine.  Is the flu vaccine safe for my child with chronic health problems?  Yes. The flu vaccine that is given as a shot is approved for use in children 6 months and older, including both healthy children and those with chronic health problems. Because children with chronic health conditions are at a higher risk of getting flu related complications, it is especially important that they get a flu shot. What types of vaccine should my child receive and how many doses? Children with or without chronic health conditions should get the flu shot (inactivated flu vaccine) only. Children 6 months to 8 years old may need 2 doses of the vaccine. Children 9 years of age and older need only one dose. Talk with your doctor to discuss how many doses are recommended for your child. How can I plan ahead with my child's school or child care? Find out your child's school or child care providers plan for flu season. Let them know your child is at high-risk for flu related problems. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that all children 6 months and older, especially those with chronic health conditions, get a seasonal flu vaccine.

        "content": "The stress of a serious illness,    chronic health condition  or    disability  in a child often causes problems in a family. It is worse when each parent or adult caregiver attempts to deal with    their own fears and frustrations  related to the chronic health condition or disability alone and without support. In some instances, parents become consumed with the care of their child with a chronic illness or disability, at the expense of nearly everything else in their lives. In these situations, they may find themselves almost constantly looking for new options, reading about    alternative treatments , and thinking about the future. They may ask themselves questions such as:   \"Is there a better medication for my child?\"   \"Is it worth getting another doctor's opinion?\"   \"Can I be doing more?\" Demands on the parent Parents might feel that the demands upon them have no end (such as trips to the doctor's office or preparation of special meals). Parents may feel constantly tired and never able to find energy to do anything else. Time spent with a spouse and one's own personal interests and hobbies is often given up. How families can thrive  However, families can also thrive as they embrace and love a child with a chronic illness or disability. A child with health problems may bring parents and other family members closer. Families—especially those who    communicate openly —may be strengthened by experiences associated with managing their child's health condition or disability. In many cases, the family's management of a child's chronic condition may provide them with a sense of cohesiveness, mission, mastery, and pride which    builds the resiliency of the family . Who can help You should not expect or attempt to solve all family problems associated with your child's illness or disability by yourself. It is important not to isolate yourself as a parent or caregiver of a child with a chronic health condition or disability. \t Pediatricians , psychologists,    social workers , family therapists, and parents of other children with chronic illnesses and disabilities are very important resources for helping to work through family problems. Ask for help.  Social networks can also be valuable sources of support for you in your community. Examples include condition specific support groups, faith based groups, extended family and friends.

What causes JIA? This is a great question that, unfortunately, does not have a perfect answer. What we do know is that in children with JIA, the immune system causes inflammation in joints. What we do not know yet is why. It is likely that multiple factors can contribute to developing JIA. Some children may have been exposed to an illness, a certain medication or something else in their environment that triggers the immune system. Once the immune system is active, it can attack joints by mistake. The trigger is usually never identified.  Some children may be more likely to develop arthritis because of the genes they inherited from their parents. It is important for children with JIA and their parents to understand that there is not anything you can do to prevent JIA from developing.  What are the symptoms of JIA? For the most part, JIA symptoms affect only a child's joints and not other organs such as the heart, kidneys, lungs and intestines. The most common joints to be affected by JIA are the knees, ankles, wrists, elbows and small joints in the hands. The symptoms of JIA may vary depending on the child's age and the type of JIA. However, there are some symptoms that are common among all children.\t Swelling  is the most common symptoms and almost always seen in joints with arthritis. The swelling is limited to just the joint (not the whole foot or arm, for example). It will not come and go over the course of the day. It persists and will slowly get worse over time. \t Stiffness  is usually worst in the morning or after being inactive for a long time (such as sitting in class or long car rides). Stiffness usually improves throughout the day or with activity. In some children with arthritis, stiffness limits their ability to completely straighten or bend a joint.\t Pain  in joints with arthritis mostly happens in the morning and can improve with activity, just like stiffness. For most children with JIA the pain is mild. They may not complain of any pain, especially early in the disease process. Some joints may be more painful than others. \t Limping  is a result of arthritis affecting the knees, ankles, feet or hips. This is a common early symptom of arthritis, especially in young children who are not able to describe their other symptoms well.\t Change in function  such as trouble using crayons, not holding a fork normally, or not playing or climbing may be a sign of arthritis. Many children find a way to make up for their stiffness and pain, and learn how to do certain activities a different way.  How is JIA diagnosed? The diagnosis of JIA is made based on a careful physical exam and review of the child's symptoms and medical history. In some cases, blood work and imaging (x-ray, ultrasound, MRI) tests may be needed. In many patients, lab tests may be normal, however. It is important to know that there are no labs that diagnose JIA.  Is all JIA the same? Not all cases of JIA are the same. There are certain features that may provide an idea of what symptoms to expect, and how severe they may be for a child. For example: Children with multiple joints involved, those with arthritis that affects the hip, ankle or wrist, or who have joint damage that can be seen on x-rays are likely to have more challenging cases of JIA. Children with these symptoms are more likely to need more aggressive treatment, and often longer courses of treatment. This also includes children with a positive            Rheumatoid Factor (RF)  in their blood work. This is rare, though.  Some children with JIA develop            dactylitis  which is when a finger or toe is swollen and red (sometimes called “sausage-like\" swelling). These children are more likely to develop            psoriasis  later in life.  Children with a specific genetic marker called            HLA-B27  are more likely to develop inflammation in their sacroiliac joints, where the base of the spine connects to the hip bones. This can cause stiffness and pain in the lower back. It is more common in older children and boys.  What are the treatment options for JIA? The treatment of JIA is centered on controlling abnormal inflammation in joints. It is important to work with a  pediatric rheumatologist​  who understands your goals to create a treatment plan that is right for you and your child. Some children can be treated by injecting a steroid into the joint or joints with arthritis. For many, treatment will require a medication that targets the immune system. As researchers work towards understanding immune system triggers and how they cause inflammation, our treatments have become more targeted and specific. Many of the newer medications for JIA use “biologic\" ways to treat the disease, such as helping the body block signals that lead to inflammation. In addition to medicine, treatment of JIA often involves physical therapy. This can help a child regain their normal range of motion in joints. Physical therapy can also help strengthen muscles that may have become weak when the child's swollen and sore joints prevented normal activity.  What is uveitis and why do I see an ophthalmologist? Uveitis is a type of inflammation inside the eye. About 10-20% of children with JIA will develop uveitis. Unfortunately, there are often no symptoms until the inflammation has already caused damage. To help catch and treat uveitis before there is damage, children with JIA need to see an ophthalmologist for frequent screening eye exams. Does JIA ever go away? For some children, yes. This is called remission. For some children, arthritis will go into remission only to come back months to years later. It is difficult to predict which children will go into permanent remission and which children will need to continue treatment into adulthood. Fortunately, advances in the treatment and monitoring of JIA have improved the prognosis for all children.

        "content": "Our child has a chronic illness or disability. How can we help him learn to live as best as he can with his condition? When you first learn that your child has a     \t disability  or a     \t chronic illness , the news is often unexpected and can seem devastating. Many families experience a sense of powerlessness in the beginning at the prospect of dealing with a chronic illness, health problem, or disability and often feel very stressed at facing a future filled with unknowns. Knowledge Is Power As a first step, it is important for you and your child to try to understand your child's special needs, and try to find out as much as you can about her condition and its care. The more information parents and children have, the less frightening the present and future will seem. Knowledge is empowering. It can help both you and your child feel more in control of the condition and the impact and     \t effects on your child's life and on your family . Information will also help you plan, guide and advocate for and with your child. Over time, you can teach him      (if possible)  to manage his own condition and learn to be his own advocate through the potentially complicated pediatric and adult health care and educational systems. Informing Your Child about His Condition The type of information you convey to your child should be appropriate for your child's age and developmental abilities. You can gauge this best by listening to her questions.  Studies show, for instance, that kindergarten-age children typically view illness as quite magical: One child, when asked         \"How do you get better from an asthma attack?\"  simply responded,         \"Don't wheeze.\" Young children who have diabetes may sometimes believe their illness is because of eating too much candy. Some children believe they have become ill and been hospitalized as punishment for not listening to their mother or father. Beginning at about ages 10 to 12, children begin to grasp the complex ways that things can cause or be a factor in a disease or disability. By the fourth grade, children tend to believe that germs cause all illness. These older children may be capable of understanding more factual information about their condition.  Remember that as children grow up, their ability to understand information and take responsibility for their own care increases. Every year or so, someone should check out what the child understands about his illness or disability, fill in the gaps and correct information that he does not understand correctly. All too often, the explanations and details about the condition discussed with a child and youth stop at the time of diagnosis Helping Your Child Manage Stress\t Stress  is a part of life. It motivates us to succeed, but it can also interfere with life's joys and accomplishments. Children with chronic illnesses and disabilities often deal with more stress than other children. For example, they may have to cope with an imperfect body, frequent hospitalizations, painful injections, surgery, or even premature death. A child with kidney disease who requires dialysis three times a week has regular and repeated periods of stress to address. A child with cancer, who must undergo repeated chemotherapy, often has to manage the fears and anxieties of each future treatment. A child with epilepsy may feel anxious about the possibility of having another seizure. Unfortunately, there are no simple ways to help your child avoid these stresses.  Suggestions to Reduce the Negative Impact or Effects of These Stresses on Your Child: \t Listen to your child.  Whether she or he is feeling sadness, frustration, or rage, it is helpful for a child to express these emotions. A child should feel that she can share her thoughts and fears with you freely and without you overreacting or becoming upset. Ask how she is feeling if your child does not say anything. Be available and supportive. Listen not only to what your child says, but also try to hear what is left unspoken.\t Inform your child about what lies ahead.  Anxiety is often based on the unknown or on inaccurate beliefs about the future. Find out what your child does and does not know. Explain exactly what will happen during an upcoming doctor's appointment or hospital visit; if you are unable to answer all your child's questions, both of you should talk to the doctor. Do not expose a child to a frightening procedure unless she has been told about it ahead of time. Talking with other children who have gone through the same experiences can be very helpful.\t \"Rehearsal\" can help children cope with new situations that appear frightening.  Many hospitals can now arrange for children to spend time in the children's ward before they undergo surgery or other procedures. These visits can make clear to children about what the hospital setting is like and what to expect.\t Encourage your child to spend time with other children with a chronic illness or disability that is the same or similar to your child's condition.\t Frequently talk about the illness or condition so that your child feels comfortable being open about it.\t Emphasize your child's strengths and support efforts to develop new strengths  – the things she can do well despite the condition.\t Help your child feel that he can be in control of some aspects of each health care related event or situation.  Try to find choices that can be given to him, such as which arm to have blood drawn from, when a procedure will occur, or what reward he will get for cooperating.\t Call your pediatrician for an appointment if you have concerns about your child's mood or behavior at home or school \t (i.e., sad, anxious, irritable, aggressive).  Your pediatrician will want to talk with you and your child and determine if your child needs to be evaluated and treated by a therapist or counselor or other mental health provider. Independence Children's capacity for independence varies from illness to illness and child to child and will steadily increase with maturity. If your child has diabetes, you may have to test her blood sugar level and make sure insulin injections are given regularly during her younger years. If she requires a special diet, you will need to supervise food choices and eating habits closely. At the same time, watch for signals from her that she is able to assume greater responsibility, and help her take on more of the management of the illness little by little as she gets older. Some children avoid accepting more independence and self-management of their condition. Families may not mean to but foster dependency because they find it easier to maintain responsibility for their child's care, rather than teaching the child to perform certain tasks and relying on her to do so. Also, some children may enjoy being the object of their parents' special attention. They may relish having certain tasks' performed for them, and may resist taking responsibility. It is critical to help your child come to terms with his health condition and accept developmentally and age appropriate responsibility for caring for himself. Try not to deprive your child of the important and rewarding experience of mastering day-to-day tasks; it instills pride and self-confidence that prepares him for adult life. Praise his efforts at assuming responsibility, and applaud yourself for having the wisdom and courage to let him take these very important steps. Self-management skills should also be more formally assessed and encouraged in youth starting at age 14 years of age with your child's pediatrician. Youth should help develop a shared medical summary and emergency care plan with their health care providers and develop linkages to any needed community-based supports. Parent and youth should also begin to address issues of legal decision-making and guardianship as appropriate with their providers starting at age 16 years of age. Youth and families should also ask about options for adult health care providers and the process for transferring care. Your Pediatrician Can Help Discuss any of your concerns and any limitations with your child's pediatrician. Using your doctor's input, develop some guidelines for sensible restrictions if needed while also encouraging your child to participate in a diversity of activities and gain more responsibility for their care. Parents need to recognize their children's changing needs and to plan for them. It is also important for parents to be educated and up-to-date about their child's illness or disability and about new treatments and their effects. Most children with chronic illnesses or disabilities do well in school, develop appropriately and achieve their goals in much the same way that other children do. Most are healthy children who happen to have a chronic illness or disability. While their illness may create certain difficulties, with the support of their parents and other     \t community based services  as needed most lead happy, effective and exciting lives and grow up to become productive adults.

        "content": "By: Marla Guzman, MD, FAAP​ &  Grant Syverson​​, MD, FAAP Lupus is a condition that causes uncontrolled inflammation or swelling. It can affect many different parts of the body in unpredictable ways. Most people diagnosed with lupus are adults. However, childhood-onset lupus (meaning the disease develops before the age of 18) accounts for up to one one-fifth of lupus cases.      Read on to learn more about lupus in children and teens, and how help keep it under control.  What is lupus? Lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus or SLE) is a chronic auto-immune disease. This means the immune system produces antibodies that attack healthy cells and tissues. Normally, our antibodies target foreign invaders like viruses or bacteria to keep us healthy—they do not normally target our own cells. The antibody attacks create inflammation that can cause damage to the skin, joints, and internal organs like the kidneys, brain, heart and lungs. What causes lupus? There is no known cause of lupus, but both genetic (hereditary) and environmental factors are believed to both play roles in developing lupus. Who gets lupus? Lupus more commonly affects females, although males can develop the disease as well. In fact, in childhood-onset lupus, the proportion of males affected is actually higher than it is in adults. It is estimated that as many as 10,000 children in the United States are dealing with the disease. Lupus is more common in non-Caucasian children. Children with lupus may have a family member with lupus or another auto-immune condition.  What are the signs and symptoms of lupus? Lupus can affect any part of the body, and each child may have different symptoms. The younger children are, the more aggressive lupus may be. Some symptoms may include: Malar (“butterfly\") rash on face Joint pain or swelling (arthritis) Mouth sores Bald spots (alopecia) Fatigue Weight loss Fever Chest pain Shortness of breath The kidneys are often inflamed in children with lupus, but this usually doesn't cause symptoms unless the inflammation is severe. Your child's      pediatric rheumatologist  will monitor your child for kidney problems frequently using blood and urine tests and checking blood pressure.  Besides kidney issues, other serious complications can develop. These include developing blood clots and inflammation in the central nervous system (brain or spine). Blood clots are most common in the legs and may cause pain, swelling, redness, or warmth. If the central nervous system is involved, your child may have headaches, seizures, or behavioral changes. How is lupus diagnosed? The diagnosis of lupus is not always straightforward and requires a thorough work-up with a pediatric rheumatologist. They will make a diagnosis of lupus based on your child's symptoms, physical examination findings, and your child's laboratory test results.  Laboratory test results in lupus may include: Low numbers of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets Elevated markers of inflammation Abnormal kidney or liver function tests Protein or blood in urine tests Low complement levels (the complement system is a part of the immune system) Positive antibodies such as ANA and anti-double stranded DNA\t *NOTE:  A positive ANA result without other signs, symptoms, or laboratory findings of lupus IS NOT an indication that a child has lupus. A positive ANA can be seen in a percentage of healthy children or when a child has a viral infection. Is there a cure for lupus? Although currently there is no cure for lupus, there are  treatments​  that can help manage the disease. Specialized care for lupus Because lupus can affect so many organ systems, your child will likely see other specialists along with their pediatric rheumatologist. These specialists might include: Pediatric nephrologists (kidneys) Pediatric dermatologists (skin) Pediatric hematologists (blood) Pediatric pulmonologists (lungs) Pediatric cardiologists (heart) What are lupus flares? Children with lupus may experience “flares,\" a worsening of symptoms also known as exacerbations. These flares cause symptoms to get worse and they can be brought on by infections, excessive sun or ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, or when your child is tapering off lupus medications. How do I manage my child's lupus? If your child is diagnosed with lupus, your child's rheumatologist will prescribe      medications  to help manage symptoms and keep the immune system from overreacting Along with medications, there are other things you can do to help keep your child's symptoms at bay. For example:\t Limit sun exposure.  Since sunlight (UV light) can worsen lupus symptoms, it's important for your child to wear sunscreen daily (make sure it's SPF 30 or higher) and to wear hats, long-sleeved shirts, and pants when they are in the sun. \t Maintain a healthy lifestyle.  Some medications may cause weight gain, so eating a healthy, balanced diet and getting regular physical activity are crucial. A healthy lifestyle can also increase your child's energy, help them sleep better, and boost their mood.\t Avoid infections.  People with lupus are immunosuppressed, which means their immune system has difficulty working. This can be either from the lupus itself or from medications. Because of this, children with lupus may be more prone to getting infections than other kids, so it's extra important to encourage good hand-washing and to stay away from sick people. If your child develops a fever of 100.4 degrees or more or develops symptoms of an infection, be sure to let their pediatric rheumatologist know right away. \t Keep vaccinations current.  It's important to keep your child's vaccinations up to date, but keep in mind that people who are immunosuppressed shouldn't receive live (activated) vaccines. Check with your pediatrician and pediatric rheumatologist if you're not sure about the type of vaccination your child needs. To keep your child healthy, additional vaccinations that aren't part of the regular vaccination schedule but prevent other infectious diseases are also recommended. These include the annual influenza vaccine (inactivated form) and the pneumococcal vaccine. How else can I help my child with lupus?  Living with lupus doesn't mean that your child can't lead a normal life. In fact, kids with lupus are encouraged to continue living like they normally would.  Your child may require a      504 plan  for school that will allow them certain accommodations if needed. Contact your child's school district to learn more about this.  Since lupus is a disease that affects multiple organ systems, your child may have to see many different types of specialists, which can cause them to miss school. You can work with your child's school and pediatric rheumatology team to try to coordinate avoiding multiple absences.

        "content": "By: Jenna Klotz, MD, MS, FAAP  Muscular dystrophies are genetic muscle disorders which cause progressive muscle weakness. There are more than 40 different types. Symptoms can be present at birth or may not occur until adolescence or adulthood. Similarly, muscle weakness can progress at different rates. Here's what families need to know. What causes muscular dystrophy?  Muscular dystrophies are caused by abnormalities in proteins that are important for the structure and function of muscle. These abnormalities are caused by genetic changes, which can be inherited or can be a new change found only in the affected person.  When you move, your muscle fibers contract and stretch, which puts stress on the muscle. In healthy muscles, the muscle can withstand this physical stress and heal itself when injured. However, with muscular dystrophy, the muscle fibers have abnormal structure or function; even routine physical activity can injure the muscles and the muscles do not heal as they should. Over time, this causes progressive muscle loss and weakness.  What are the different types of muscular dystrophy?  The most common types of muscular dystrophies in children are    Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)  and    Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) . DMD and BMD are caused by mutations in    dystrophin  which is located on the X chromosome. DMD affects 1 in about 5000 males. Although primarily males are affected, females can have symptoms, particularly related to the heart muscle.  Duchenne muscular dystrophy Males with DMD may have borderline delays in gross motor skills in the first 1-2 years of life. Symptoms typically become more apparent between 3-5 years old, when they may have more falls than typical for their age. They may also have difficulty walking up and down stairs and standing up from the floor. In addition, they may appear to \" waddle \" when they walk and can have enlarged calf muscles. Children with DMD typically lose the ability to walk in their early teenage years and pass away in their 20s to 40s. This is because of weakness in their breathing muscles (respiratory failure) or abnormalities in their heart muscle ( cardiomyopathy ).  Becker muscular dystrophy Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) generally has less severe muscle weakness, later onset and slower, less predictable progression. However, the heart muscle can be affected like it is with DMD. In some cases of BMD, cardiomyopathy causing heart failure may be the first sign with little to no apparent limb weakness.  Other types of muscular dystrophy\t Limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) : In LGMD, muscle weakness starts in the muscles closest to the center of the body, including the hips, pelvis, shoulders, upper arms and legs. Over time, weakness can spread to other muscles. There are over 25 types of LGMD. \t Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD):  In FSHD, the earliest muscles with weakness include those in the face, shoulder and upper back, lower abdomen, and lower leg. Shoulder blades may appear to stick out (\"winged scapula\"). Weakness can be asymmetric (different on each side of the body) and usually progresses slowly. Most individuals with FSHD develop symptoms in adolescence or early adulthood. However, 5% to 10% have symptoms before age 10.    ( Parents: if your child is affected by FSHD, share with them \"Strength Isn't Just Physical,\" below. ) \t   Myotonic Dystrophy:  Myotonic dystrophy is the most common muscular dystrophy in adults but can also affect newborns and children. Newborns with myotonic dystrophy have low muscle tone and weakness at birth and typically need support for breathing and feeding. This often improves over time before they develop increased muscle weakness in later teenage years and difficulty relaxing muscles (myotonia). Intellectual disability is common. People with childhood-onset myotonic dystrophy may have learning or cognitive issues as their primary symptom and later develop muscle weakness and myotonia.\t Congenital muscular dystrophy:  Children with congenital muscular dystrophy have low muscle tone and weakness at birth. ( See \"Parent to Parent,\"  below.) Kids with some types of congenital muscular dystrophy may have abnormal brain structure on MRI, abnormal eye structure and sometimes    seizures . \t Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD):  Individuals with EDMD typically develop symptoms between 5-10 years old. They develop contractures (stiff or fixed joints), followed by slowly progressive weakness in their upper arms and lower legs. Later, they develop weakness in their shoulders, pelvis, and hips. Heart failure and    abnormal heart rhythms  are common and usually start after age 20. \t Collagen-related muscular dystrophy:  Collagen is a major component of connective tissue, which provides support for joints, skin and other structures in the body. So, children with collagen-related muscular dystrophy may have contractures (fixed joints) or overly flexible joints (hyperlaxity) early on. They can also have hyperkeratosis (bumpy, dry skin), very soft skin on their palms and soles, and poor wound healing. Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy is the most severe form, with signs shortly after birth. Bethlem myopathy is the mildest form with slowly progressive weakness starting in childhood or early adulthood. There are also intermediate forms. \t   Building a Community of Support\t By: Stephanie & Jon Betts\t Our son, Henry James, came into the world at 37 weeks, just under 6 pounds, with a distinctly weak, chirping cry. To this day, he is still our \"baby bird.\" As parents of two, we were familiar with the joy and anxiety that come with having a new baby. While those new parent concerns were calmed by our experience with Henry's sisters, we also noticed some differences very early on.\t Tummy time  was a battle that Henry never won. Rather than lifting his head up, he would cry himself to sleep. He would take ages with a bottle, often growing too tired to even finish. When we picked Henry up under his armpits, it felt like he was going to slide right through our hands. At a 3-month checkup, it became clear that this was more than Henry just progressing on his own time. Our pediatrician gave us the option to pursue testing immediately or wait, and we didn't hesitate to proceed with testing right away. We wanted to know what Henry was dealing with so he didn't have to continue struggling on his own. Henry's neurologist tested his blood for high protein, a symptom of muscular dystrophy. Results showed that Henry had a protein level of over 90 times the typical amount. It was devastating to hear, but also also a relief. Over the next few weeks, Henry's diagnosis became    Congenital Merosin-Deficient Muscular Dystrophy . We were still fearful, but grateful to know what we were dealing with and began building a support system.\t Since that diagnosis, Henry's health journey has been punctuated by challenges big and small. He's had multiple hospitalizations for pneumonia, broken bones, and surgeries to lengthen his hamstring muscles, set his femurs and rebuild his hip joints. He's had sleep and swallow studies, breathing treatments and cough assist machines. But he's also had overwhelming support from his medical team. Henry is genuinely excited to see the specialists he works with, and they hold a special place in our hearts too. Despite his health challenges, Henry makes friends easily and his wheelchair and physical limitations have never been an issue with his peers. Henry's big sisters, Grace and Claire, are loving and helpful even when he is being annoying in a way only the youngest child can. We are extremely fortunate to be surrounded by a community that cares for Henry and us. This community includes the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) and their running group,    Team Momentum . They've been there as we've moved to a more accessible home, purchased a ramp-equipped van and navigated the challenges of travel with a power wheelchair. We lean on this group often, and we simply couldn't do it without them.\t Parenting, especially if you have a child with a disability, is filled with wondering, \"Am I handling this properly?\" One of the biggest challenges we've found is extending grace towards ourselves and finding time for    self-care . This is essential for us to be fully present for our children and is a process we work towards each day. To families who find themselves on the path we started over 10 years ago, we have simple advice: First, build your community. Accept support and ask for help. Second, know that you can never advocate too strongly for your child. You are their voice. Be proactive and speak up for what they deserve. Remember, you are not alone. \t Henry James Betts is pictured above with his family, in his power chair, and with his dad, preparing to run a marathon. The Betts family would like to extend their gratitude towards the medical specialists, school staff, aides, family, friends and so many others who make up their loving community of support.  How do I know if my child has muscular dystrophy? In addition to muscle weakness and delay in    motor skills , children with muscular dystrophy often have high levels of creatine kinase (CK). CK is a muscle enzyme, which can be detected with a blood test. Genetic testing is often able to confirm the diagnosis of muscular dystrophy. However, additional testing, such as electrical tests of the nerves and muscles (EMG and nerve conduction studies), muscle MRI and muscle biopsy may be necessary for some children. What other challenges can people with muscular dystrophy have?\t Respiratory muscle weakness:  Muscles of the chest wall and the diaphragm are important breathing muscles and can become weak. This also causes the chest wall to become stiff, which can further worsen breathing function. Some individuals with muscular dystrophy need breathing support or ventilators only when sleeping, while others need it continuously. In addition, they can have a weak cough, making it harder for them to clear mucus. Their pulmonologist (lung specialist) may recommend additional treatments and devices to help them cough more effectively.\t Heart muscle or heart rhythm abnormalities:  Cardiomyopathy, or abnormal pumping and function of the heart muscle, occurs in certain types of muscular dystrophy and can lead to heart failure. Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) can also occur.\t Scoliosis and contractures:  Individuals with muscular dystrophy can develop joint deformities called contractures, in which the joint becomes stiff or fixed. They may also have progressive curving (scoliosis) or rigidity in their spine. Contractures and scoliosis impair their mobility further and scoliosis can contribute to breathing difficulties.\t Swallowing and speech problems:  The muscles used for swallowing and speaking can also become weak. Some children may need a feeding tube or adaptive communication devices.\t Learning and social challenges:  Some children with muscular dystrophy have learning differences, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or developmental delays outside of those from muscle weakness. These children may benefit from having special education or other educational support services to optimize their learning. Are there treatments available for muscular dystrophy? All children with muscular dystrophy should have a multi-disciplinary care team. This team should include rehabilitation medicine specialists (for physical, occupational and speech therapies), neurologists, pediatricians and often pulmonologists, cardiologists, orthopedics, dietitian and gastroenterologists. School support services are also key. The first gene therapy treatment for DMD has been    approved  by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration. This treatment is given as a single intravenous (through a vein) dose and was approved after    clinical trials . For DMD, there are additional treatments that slow progression of the disease. Steroids delay the loss of the ability to walk. Steroid medications may also help preserve arm strength and respiratory muscle strength, even for people dependent on wheelchairs. For certain types of DMD, there are additional treatments called \"exon-skipping\" medications which can help increase the amount of dystrophin protein in the muscle. Steroids are sometimes used in other types of limb girdle muscular dystrophy. There are some medications that can be helpful for muscle and non-muscle symptoms seen in myotonic dystrophy. There is lots of active research into therapies for muscular dystrophies, and there may be additional muscular dystrophy treatments available in the future.\t \t    Strength Isn't Just Physical\t By: Abby Svoboda  \t High school is    tough.  There's pressure to figure out your future and fit in. As I personally learned, most people feel self-conscious. When I was in high school, I became extremely self-conscious of the way I walked, and it took years to learn why and to accept it.  I joined the tennis team and started to enjoy running too. I began running regularly, eager to get a few miles in before or after school. During this time, I began experiencing shoulder, back and hip pain that my doctor wrote off as growing pains. I figured I hadn't been working hard enough and pushed myself to do better.  A year later, my pain was increasing. I had become a significantly slower runner, and the way I walked started to change. People asked if I'd hurt my knee or ankle and friends harmlessly teased me. It became obvious that this was not just growing pain and during my sophomore year, I was diagnosed with a type of muscular dystrophy called Facioscapulohumeral Dystrophy (FSHD).    Knowing the cause of my pain and weakness was a relief, but my diagnosis presented new challenges. There were no treatments for FSHD on the horizon and it was a progressive disease. I was told things would get harder, and they did. But I was incredibly fortunate to have wonderful parents who did anything to help me, along with a strong support system of family and friends.  My support system helped me stay optimistic as I endured the physical and emotional challenges of growing weaker. I had many hard days that often made it difficult to stay positive. Progress in neuromuscular disease research and treatments kept me hopeful.  In 2019, I began participating in a clinical trial aimed at stopping the expression of the gene that causes FSHD. The trial was not a silver bullet, and it has not dramatically changed my condition. However, it is an incredible step in the right direction. Until an effective treatment for FSHD is found, I continue using the tools available to me to manage it and live a happy life filled with loving family and friends, a fulfilling career, fun hobbies and big dreams. I often wonder how life would have unfolded without this curveball, and I would be lying if I said I didn't often wish it was not a part of my life. But while this part of my life is hard and uncertain, it has shaped me into the person I was meant to be. My own limitations have helped me become more patient and understanding with others, and the occasional ignorant comment has shaped me into a strong self-advocate. Most importantly, FSHD has shown me how resilient I am, and that strength is not always physical.\t Abby Svoboda, pictured above with her fiancé, Michal, is a communications professional who is passionate about improving accessibility and inclusion for people with disabilities. She lives in Chicago and enjoys biking, visiting new restaurants and spending time with her friends and family. Finding resources & support Being diagnosed with muscular dystrophy can be overwhelming for children and their families. Your doctors and healthcare team are there to support you and your child. There are many    organizations  and    support groups  for muscular dystrophy. Supportive care extends the life of people with muscular dystrophy and there is hope for additional treatments in the near future.    More information\t Is Your Child's Physical Development on Track?

        "content": "Parents are not the only ones who must adjust to a child's illness or disability. Life changes for the entire family. Parents have to pay extra attention to a child with a      chronic illness  or      disability , and      brothers and sisters  may often feel neglected. They might also have difficulty learning to live with the stresses of having a sibling with a chronic health problem or disability. How Siblings Might Feel: Guilt that they are not sick ( \"Why him and not me?\")  Wonder whether they might have caused their sibling's illness  Anxious about becoming sick themselves Jealous and wish could become the center of the family's attention Angry if they are asked to assume more         household chores  than their sibling with a chronic health problem Guilty when they resent the additional responsibility they are tasked with  Embarrassed or even angry when strangers stare at their brother or sister in a wheelchair, or when other children tease their sibling because he or she looks different What Parents Can Do: Be aware that while attending to the needs of your child with a chronic illness or disability, you may be neglecting – or creating unfair expectations for – your other children. At times, siblings may feel invisible unless they demand attention. However, siblings can learn to participate in the family and feel pride and love in helping their brother or sister with his or her health problem. The presence of a family member with a chronic illness provides opportunities for increased empathy, responsibility, adaptability, problem solving and creativity. Try to establish some balance between the needs of your child with a chronic health problem or disability and those of your other children.  Spending some time with each child individually may help.  Develop a special relationship with each one of your children.  Keep in mind that siblings need to have honest information about the condition and to have their questions listened to and answered. Signs Siblings Are Having Trouble: When there is a child with a chronic illness or disability in your family, your other children may experience negative effects.  Warning signs the siblings of your child with a chronic health condition or disability may need some extra attention:\t Anxious\t Depressed Withdrawn Angry Losing interest in friends\t Doing poorly in school\t Pushing too hard to achieve Rebellious Losing interest in activities that once brought pleasure, such as         sports  or music lessons Acting out in other ways to get attention \t If you are concerned, ask your child's pediatrician for help.  He or she can guide you to local      psychologists , social workers,      family therapists , child life specialists, and/or support groups for siblings of children with chronic health problems or disabilities. You should not expect or attempt to solve these concerns related to the siblings of your child with a chronic illness or disability by yourself.  Developing Resilience in Your Family:  Every family will learn how to embrace and show love for a child with a chronic health problem or disability. There is no right way or wrong way for siblings to live and grow together; rather, every family should strive for its own balance and determine what are some strategies and supports that help the child with chronic health problems and her siblings to thrive and be resilient.  The ultimate goal is to build internal strengths and coping skills in your child with a chronic health problem or disability and in all of the members of your family. Many factors will influence this process, including the course of the chronic condition and the external and internal supports and resources available to the child with special needs, her siblings, and the rest of the family.  While most families with chronic health problems or disabilities struggle through times of fear and despair, many also develop an internal      resilience , a creativity, and a closeness or cohesiveness that helps the children with and without chronic health problems and rest of the family to manage and cope together with the many stressors that may develop over time. Often as a result of these experiences, adults and children learn about their strengths and limitations, talk more openly, and learn new ways to solve problems which fosters mastery and pride.  In the months and years ahead: Continue to reassess the needs and goals for your child with chronic illness or disability, their siblings, and your family.  Be willing to learn new skills, search for supports and make changes as needed that serve both the child with the chronic health problem, their siblings, and everyone else in the family.  As much as possible, involve all of your children in shared decision making about any health care that affects them.  Stay informed and give yourself credit for all the hard work you and your family have done and the resiliency you have developed in your family.

        "content": "By: Rachelle Nuss, MD, FAAP Sickle cell disease is a group of inherited blood disorders that can cause episodes of severe pain and many other medical challenges. The condition is most often discovered during routine newborn screening tests. Children of all ethnic backgrounds may be diagnosed with sickle cell disease.  Learn more about sickle cell disease and how early and ongoing care and treatment helps manage symptoms and prevent complications. How does sickle cell disease affect children? In children with sickle cell disease, a protein called hemoglobin that carries oxygen inside the red blood cells forms chains that clump together. This causes the red blood cell to be shaped like a crescent moon or a sickle tool.    Compared to normal red blood cells that are disk-shaped and flexible, sickled cells are stiff, sticky and fragile. They break apart more easily than normal red blood cells, stick together and damage the blood vessels. This results in areas of blocked blood flow, inflammation (swelling) and less oxygen getting to tissues in the body. \t \t  Image Source: U.S. National Library of Medicine  How do infants and children get sickle cell disease? Babies are born with sickle cell disease. The baby receives one hemoglobin gene from each parent. The \"normal\" common hemoglobin gene is A. So, most people receive an A from one parent and an A from the other. They are called AA.    But hemoglobin genes may mutate (change) from A to many other types with different letters. The most common change results in S (sickle) or C hemoglobin. The mutated (changed) hemoglobin gene associated with sickle cell disease is S. When an S is joined by some other mutated hemoglobin genes, that combination causes sickle cell disease. The most common type of sickle cell disease is SS. Another less common type is SC. Sometimes a S is joined with a gene that doesn’t make any A hemoglobin (Sbeta zero thalassemia) or a gene that makes very little A hemoglobin (Sbeta+thalassemia) and that results in sickle cell disease. There are even more. less frequently occurring types of sickle cell disease.    How sickle cell disease is inherited: an example\t   Genes come in pairs—one from each parent. Which gene a child inherits is random, like throwing a dice. Inheriting one normal A and a mutated or abnormal gene gives someone a \"trait.\"   \t   In the image above, the parents have AC and AS traits, respectively. One of their children inherits the AC trait and one the AS trait. The parents and children are generally well. Often, they may not even know they have a trait.\t   Inheriting an S, sickle gene, and another abnormal hemoglobin gene may cause sickle cell disease. In the picture above, one child has sickle cell disease, the child who inherits SC. One child inherits the normal or usual pattern of AA.\t   Image source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention How do I know if my baby has sickle cell trait or disease? Every state in the U.S. performs a    newborn screening test  for sickle cell disease. Your baby’s primary health care provider receives the result and reviews it with you. If a trait is present, the primary caregiver will talk with you about it. If the results suggests sickle cell disease, the baby is referred to a pediatric hematologist (blood specialist for children).  Prompt diagnosis—before infants show any symptoms—allows infants with sickle cell disease to get early treatment and parents to learn about ways to help lower the risk of serious health problems. Who is affected by sickle cell disease?    A carrier of a single hemoglobin S gene is said to have sickle cell trait or hemoglobin S trait. People with hemoglobin S trait alone do not have sickle cell disease. However, if their reproductive partner also has the hemoglobin S trait, then together they have a 1 in 4 chance (25%) of having a child with sickle cell disease.  About    1 in 12  people of African ancestry carry S trait. About    1 in 365  Black or African American people are born with sickle cell disease each year in the United States. However, sickle cell trait is also common in people with ancestors from the Caribbean, Middle East, India, South America, Central America and Mediterranean countries such as Turkey, Greece and Italy. Sickle cell trait is found today in descendants of the populations no matter where they live and disease occurs. Why is sickle cell disease sometimes called sickle cell anemia? Sickle cell disease is an umbrella term for the many specific types of sickle cell disorders.    Anemia ―meaning a lower-than-normal hemoglobin in red blood cells―happens with all forms of sickle cell disease. While normal red blood cells can live for 120 days, sickled cells last only 7 to 20 days; the body can't replace them fast enough resulting in anemia. Sickle cell anemia refers to the two most severe forms of sickle cell disease, hemoglobin SS and sickle beta zero thalassemia. Main Types of Sickle Cell Disorders \t Hemoglobin SS  The most severe form, affecting 65% of children with sickle cell disease. Most or all of the hemoglobin is abnormal, causing chronic anemia. \t Hemoglobin SC disease Roughly 25% of children with sickle cell disease have this mild to moderate form of the disease. Symptoms generally develop later in childhood, but may be as severe as in SS.\t Sickle beta plus thalassemia Affects around 8% of children with sickle cell disease. This is generally considered a mild form of sickle cell disease, but severity can vary greatly. \t Sickle beta zero thalassemia A severe but less common form, accounting for 2% of sickle cell disease. It is similar to hemoglobin SS.\t   Why are infants and children with sickle cell disease at higher risk of infection? Sickle cell disease may cause damage to the spleen, kidneys, lungs and brain. Once damaged by sickled cells the spleen may not be able to filter bacteria from the blood as well as normal. As a result, infants and children with sickle cell disease have a compromised immune system. This means they are more likely to have certain infections which may be fatal. Antibiotics to prevent secondary infections in infants & children with sickle cell disease: National guidelines recommend newborns diagnosed with severe sickle cell disease (SS and S beta zero thalassemia) receive antibiotics twice a day until they are 5 years old. Research shows that children with sickle cell anemia given twice daily penicillin (an antibiotic) had 84% less risk of    Streptococcus pneumoniae  bacterial infection, which can cause serious conditions like pneumonia and meningitis.\t Is there a treatment or cure for sickle cell disease? Sickle cell disease is a chronic disease, meaning it does not go away. Early diagnosis and starting antibiotics shortly after birth for those with severe forms of sickle cell have greatly improved childhood survival. There are three specific approved medications including:    hydroxyurea  (ideally started at 9 months of age),    L-glutamine  (may start at 5 years of age) and    voxelotor  (may start at 2 years of age).  Bone marrow/stem cell transplant  This treatment can cure sickle cell disease. It is a procedure that takes healthy cells from a suitably matched donor, usually a sibling. These are put into the bloodstream of the child with sickle cell disease, who has been prepared with chemotherapy. Only about 19% of patients have a matched sibling donor.  Cell-based gene therapies \t The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved    new therapies  (exa-cel and lovo-cel) to treat sickle cell disease in people age 12 years and older—especially those who often have serious problems from sickle cell. The child’s stem cells are collected and changed in the laboratory. Then, the child receives chemotherapy and the changed stem cells are given back to them. Learn more about sickle cell disease gene therapy from the    National Human Genome Research Institute .  Who are the doctors that care for children with sickle cell disease? In addition to regular visits with their primary care provider, children with sickle cell disease should see a    pediatric hematologist  regularly if at all possible.

        "content": "Sickle cell trait (SCT) is an inherited condition that can be tricky to understand. It is not the same as    sickle cell disease  (SCD), red blood cell disorders that affect hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen through the body. In fact, SCT is not a disease at all. Rather, people with sickle cell trait are born with and carry    one  gene for sickle cell hemoglobin and one for regular hemoglobin. Read on to learn what this means for a child with the condition, and questions families may have about sickle cell trait.  How common is sickle cell trait? Sickle cell trait is more common in people whose ancestors are from Africa or the Middle East. It is also frequently seen in descendants of people from the Mediterranean (Italy, Turkey, Greece, India), the Caribbean and Atlantic Coast of central and South America. Anyone can have SCT. There are 3-4 million people in the U.S. who have it, and 300 million worldwide. About 1 in 12 African Americans and 1 in 150-200 Caucasians have SCT.  Can sickle cell trait turn into sickle cell disease? Sickle cell trait only rarely may put a person at risk for medical problems. Sickle cell trait does not go away, nor will it develop into sickle cell disease. Once a person is diagnosed with SCT, they do not need another test. But while someone with SCT won't develop SCD, they can pass it on genetically to their children. How is sickle cell trait inherited? We all have two copies of nearly every gene in the body, including two copies of the gene that makes hemoglobin. One copy of the hemoglobin gene comes from each parent. The normal gene for hemoglobin is called \"A.\" The sickle cell hemoglobin gene is called \"S.\"  People with sickle cell trait inherit one normal hemoglobin gene \"A\" from one parent and one sickle hemoglobin gene \"S\" from another parent. People who have sickle cell DISEASE inherit two abnormal hemoglobin \"S\" genes. There are also other unusual hemoglobins that may interact with \"S\" to cause sickle cell disease, including hemoglobin C trait, beta thalassemia trait, and hemoglobin D Punjab and other disorders. How likely is a child to inherit sickle cell trait from a parent who has it? People with sickle cell trait have a 50:50 chance for each child to inherit it. If two people with SCT have a baby, there is a 50% chance of inheriting SCT from each parent; so, there is a 25% chance of each child having normal hemoglobin, a 50% chance of having SCT, and a 25% chance of having SCD. That is, if two people with SCT have a baby 1 in 4 of those pregnancies will result in a baby with SCD and 2 in 4 in a baby with SCT. So, if you have SCT, be sure that your partner knows if they also have SCT or a different abnormal hemoglobin trait to understand your risk of having a child with SCD.  How does sickle cell disease affect people? Sickle cell disease occurs when people are born with    two  abnormal hemoglobin genes, either two sickle cell hemoglobin genes, or one sickle cell gene and one other abnormal hemoglobin gene. When this happens, a person can only make the abnormal hemoglobin. In sickle cell disease, the abnormal hemoglobin causes the red blood cells to turn into a banana or \"sickle\" shape that get stuck in small blood vessels. Clogged blood vessels may prevent oxygen from being delivered to some parts of the body, causing pain and other serious problems. Sickle cell disease can be a very serious disease, but remember that people with SCT do NOT have sickle cell pain or these problems. \t What is sickle cell anemia? Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is the name of the most common type of sickle cell disease. It usually refers to the type of sickle cell disease in which the person has two hemoglobin S or sickle cell genes. People with SCT will not turn into someone with SCD or SCA, however SCT carriers are at risk for passing the trait onto their children or depending on the trait status of their partner of having a child with SCD or SCA. \t It is important to remember that if a child has sickle cell trait, at least one of their parents also has it. Siblings may also have sickle cell trait. If you do not know your sickle cell trait status, talk with your doctor to get tested.\t   What are some of the rare health issues related to sickle cell trait?\t  \t Heat and exercise-related illness:  After intense physical activity, anyone can be at risk for  heat stroke  (exertional rhabdomyolysis). Warning signs of heat stroke include generalized weakness, difficulty breathing, dizziness or excessive sweating. While people with sickle cell trait are at increased risk for serious complications from heat related illness, very few people with SCT actually experience it. To prevent heat stroke drink plenty of    water  before, during and after exercise. It is also a good idea to rest between exercise periods, take time to slowly adjust to high altitude, humidity, and/or heat. (See more information about playing sports below.) \t Blood in the urine  ( hematuria ): This may be due to a structural problem in the kidney, inflammation, an infection, or rarely a tumor called a renal medullary carcinoma. If you have sickle cell trait and blood in the urine, please tell your doctor so a complete evaluation can be done. \t Kidney failure:\t Chronic kidney disease  is slightly more common in some people with sickle cell trait as they get older. While there is no known way to avoid kidney failure, ways to help slow the disease are to eat a healthy diet, control blood pressure and    exercise  regularly throughout life to decrease the risk of    diabetes . \t Loss of vision after an eye injury:  If there is bleeding in the eye after an injury (called a traumatic hyphema), people with sickle cell trait may develop high pressure in the eye called    glaucoma . Glaucoma may cause temporary or permanent blindness. If you have an eye injury and SCT, be sure to see a doctor tell them you have sickle cell trait.\t Splenic infarct:  This condition affects the spleen, an organ in the left upper side of the abdomen that helps fight infection. Very rarely when oxygen levels are low, the blood flow may be blocked to all or part of the spleen, causing pain, trouble breathing and nausea. This is more common with going quickly to very high altitudes (like high mountains), flying in unpressurized (not modern commercial) aircraft, scuba diving, during intense exercise and with dehydration. If you have sickle cell trait and develop unusually severe pain on your left side, please contact your doctor right away.\t Blood clots:  There is a small increased risk of blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolism) and perhaps other places in the body. At baseline    d-dimer , a test used to diagnose blood clots and monitor anti-coagulation, are elevated with sickle cell trait. If you are being evaluated for a blood clot be sure to tell your doctor that you have SCT.\t Inaccurate diabetes blood test:  The blood test most commonly used to screen and follow pre-diabetes,    Hemoglobin A1C , may not be an accurate way to measure blood sugar control in people with sickle cell trait. Again, if you have SCT tell your doctor so they can ensure the hemoglobin A1C test is done by a technique that avoids this problem. Can my child with sickle cell trait play sports? Yes! Exercise and regular physical activity are healthy for everyone, including people with sickle cell trait. Everyone, with and without SCT, should take precautions to prevent exercise-related illness such as heat stroke, severe dehydration, and muscle tissue breakdown (rhabdomyolysis). These conditions are rare but may become severe. Studies have shown that when precautions to minimize the risk of exercise-related illness are used, athletes with SCT can safely participate in intense sports training. Tips to prevent exercise-related illness with sickle cell trait:  Work on conditioning slowly.   Begin exercising with low intensity, especially at tryouts or the beginning of the sports season. Gradually increase exercise frequency and intensity (repetitions) as tolerated. Have an exercise or conditioning plan to get in shape slowly. Decrease exercise intensity during times of high heat, humidity, and altitude. Stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of water before, during, and after exercising. Do not drink alcohol, caffeine, or energy drinks around the time of exercising. These actually cause dehydration. Limit exercise when sick. If sick during exercise, stop and seek medical help. Take breaks from exercising and be sure you or your child knows to report to the coach or trainer any of these symptoms: muscle weakness cramps or pain a feeling that heaviness in the legs rapid breathing  lightheadedness or dizziness feeling overheated Testing student athletes for sickle cell trait Some high school and college athletic associations recommend that participants be tested for sickle cell trait so that coaches can be aware and prevent exercise-related illness. However, if you know you have SCT and can provide the test results, the test does not need to be repeated.\t   Is pregnancy risky if I have sickle cell trait?  Women with sickle cell trait should have no medical problems during pregnancy or delivery of their children. However, some women with SCT may be at increased risk of blood clots during pregnancy. Be sure to talk with your obstetrician if you have SCT and become pregnant.

        "content": "A chronic illness can present a special challenge for your child as she relates to other children. Youngsters constantly scrutinize one another. A child with a visible disability or one who receives special treatment may be singled out by classmates because of those differences. Middle childhood is a hard time of life for children to feel that they are different in their appearance or their ca­pacity to keep up with classmates. A condition that requires medication, fre­quent absences from school, rest periods, or special equipment, such as braces or eye patches, can cause embarrassment and make children feel like outsiders.\t However, children who differ in health, race, religion, family, and a myriad of other circumstances can discover that they have more similarities than differ­ences. One of the goals for your child's school experience is that she learn to accept and be accepted by others, regardless of differences. Bear in mind that while feeling different can be traumatic, most youngsters are quite resilient.\t They and their families not only usually learn to accept their limitations, but also find creative alternatives to problems that initially may have seemed overwhelming. These children—when assisted and supported by family, friends, and professionals—can develop into stronger individuals, despite their extra burdens.\t On the academic side, children with chronic illnesses and normal intelli­gence should demonstrate classroom achievement just as high as that of their peers. Yet studies show that many of these youngsters underachieve at school. This may occur for a number of reasons. Their stamina may be lower, or their medication may impair their alertness or make them irritable. If their illness causes them frustration, they may have emotional or behavioral prob­lems that can interfere with schoolwork.\t With diseases like sickle-cell anemia, asthma, cystic fibrosis, and diabetes, youngsters may frequently miss several days of school at a time, a period that may not be long enough to qualify for a home teacher. Hospitalizations may also keep them away from the classroom. In situations like this, your child could be at a disadvantage. If she falls behind her classmates because she is absent from school too much, she may become frustrated and her motivation may falter. She might also become anxious about having to catch up on missed assignments. This anxiety can lead her to avoid school, even when she is phys­ically able to attend. \t Most of these issues, however, can be dealt with successfully by working with the teacher, the pediatrician, and/or a child psychologist. If your child has a health problem that is likely to interrupt her regular attendance at school, plan ahead. Meet with her teacher at the start of each school year to discuss how best to keep your child up to date on her work. Plan how home­work will be sent home and thereby prevent your child from slipping too far behind. Since your child may have frequent doctor's appointments, discuss with your child's physician the importance of scheduling them after school hours whenever possible so as to avoid missing class.\t Also, by keeping your youngster's teacher updated about her health condi­tion, you and your pediatrician can work with the teacher to prevent unnec­essary disruptions of your youngster's academic progress. However, be cautious about requesting preferential treatment for your youngster at school. If her teacher frequently excuses her from homework or exams, your child may become overly dependent on this kind of special attention. The teacher may also underestimate the child's real capacity for learning and therefore have lower expectations. Most schools provide home teaching for long or in­termittent, frequent absences; this usually requires a statement of necessity from your child's pediatrician or primary physician and should be based on a careful assessment of the benefits and risks for your child.",

        "content": "​In the immediate aftermath of a diagnosis, expect your teen to ask countless questions:\t “Is this going to affect the way I look?”                         “Am I going to have to miss a lot of school?”                         “Don’t tell me I won’t be able to go out for the lacrosse team this year!”                         “What if the other kids laugh at me because the chemotherapy makes my hair fall out?”\t These questions may demand thoughtful, well-informed answers. Bear in mind that young people’s fears about medical matters may be based on misinformation. For instance, a patient recently diagnosed with Hodgkin’s disease might sadly conclude that he doesn’t have long to live. After all, everyone knows that cancer is deadly; only the year before, his favorite aunt died of ovarian cancer.\t What he needs to hear from both his doctor and his parents is that there are more than one hundred forms of cancer—many of them highly treatable. In addition, the outlook for children’s malignancies tends to be more favorable than for adult tumors. Hodgkin’s disease happens to be the most curable pediatric cancer; nine in ten kids live five years from the time of diagnosis, at which point they can essentially be declared cured.\t Another frequent source of anxiety is upcoming medical tests and procedures. A fourteen-year-old boy slated to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is utterly convinced that the scan is going to hurt. It’s \t   got \t to:  \"Did you see the \t   size \t of that machine? \t   Or what if it zaps me and I become radioactive?!\"\t The scanner \t   is \t an imposing piece of equipment, to be sure. But he’ll be relieved to hear tha​t an MRI uses electromagnetic energy, not radiation, to visualize the body. He won’t feel any pain, and he most certainly won’t glow in the dark. A kid who is prone to claustrophobia, though, may turn panicky when the portable examining table draws her into the narrow tunnel. Mom and Dad, as her \t   advocates \t within the medical system, should alert the doctor ahead of time about her aversion to confined spaces. He might prescribe a mild shortacting sedative to be taken prior to the test or arrange for an “open” MRI scanner to be used.\t To find out what your child can expect, ask the physician or one of the nurses to describe the procedure step by step. Many medical practices routinely provide informative, illustrated pamphlets beforehand.\t An adolescent should feel that he can always share what is worrying him. But, k ids don’t always say what’s on their minds. In addition to being active, empathetic listeners, we need to anticipate what they may be feeling. “Honey, you seem a bit down today. I know that having diabetes is hard for you sometimes...” “Yeah, a little down ... A lot, \t really.\" “What is it exactly that’s bothering you? Maybe I can help.” “I’m just scared, that’s all.” “Scared about the future?” “Yeah, that. What if one of those terrible things that happens to people with diabetes happens to me, like losing my sight? Or what if the diabetes messes up my kidneys? I don’t want to have to go on one of those artificial kidney machines. I can’t believe I’m seventeen and have to worry about this stuff. It’s not fair!”\t Perhaps nothing we say will dispel our child’s sadness or resentment or rage at being saddled with a health problem. However, listening nonjudgmentally and letting our children know they can talk to us any time is beneficial. For a young person, the realization that he can express his feelings freely, without being told, “You shouldn’t be (angry, depressed, etc.),” is psychologically therapeutic in itself. Honesty Is the Best Policy\t Some mothers and fathers deliberately conceal all details of the illness from the young patient, operating under the misconception that they are safeguarding their child from potentially devastating news. Seriously ill teenagers instinctively know about their condition. Ironically, they frequently refrain from discussing this with Mom and Dad for much the same reason: to protect their grief-stricken parents.\t How do they know? Their bodies tell them. In addition, no matter how careful the adults around them are, kids glean fragments of conversations and take notice of grim expressions. Ultimately, to deny a sick person the truth about his condition is an unintentionally selfish act; all the more so in the setting of a terminal disease. Children need to talk about what they’re feeling—including their fears, their conceptions of death and dying; whatever is on their minds. No one should take away their right to talk about these issues.\t On the other hand, while it’s important to answer questions honestly, try to emphasize the positive whenever possible. Let’s return to the earlier example of the adolescent diabetic who is concerned that he might develop a serious long-term complication. His mother and father might say something like this: “The doctor doesn’t know for sure what’s going to happen years from now. But most kids with diabetes go on to live normal life spans. We’re confident that you will, too. The best thing we can do is to make sure that you stay healthy by keeping your blood sugars within a normal range. Never think that you’re all alone in this; we’re here to help you, and so are your brothers and sister.” Tips for Reducing Anxieties Techniques such as            deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation     and            visualization     can help  to soothe jangled nerves before and during medical procedures. Tell your teenager about            thought stopping ,     which will allow him to control the mind instead of the other way around. Each time a negative thought comes a-knocking—about an impending needle stick, for example—the teenager literally orders his brain to switch channels. “Okay, stop it! Turn off that thought right now! Think about something else.”     It may sound overly simplistic, but with practice, this method can be extremely effective.\t ​",

        "content": "​​​​By: Marla Guzman, ​MD, FAAP & Grant Syverson, MD, FAAP Systemic lupus erythematosus ( lupus ) is a chronic condition that can affect various parts of the body. Children who have lupus often need multiple medications to help manage their symptoms. Since lupus affects every person differently, not every child will need the same medications. Your doctor will work with you to develop a treatment plan that is best for your child's individual needs. What medications are used to treat lupus? Immunosuppressants Lupus causes the immune system to overreact, which leads to excess inflammation. Lupus medications work by preventing your child's immune system from becoming overactive. These medications are called immunosuppressants. Corticosteroids​\t Also known as “steroids\" (though these aren't the same as the steroids that athletes sometimes use), corticosteroids are often the first immunosuppressant medication your child's doctor will prescribe after lupus is diagnosed. This is because steroids work quickly to suppress the immune system and ease symptoms. However, because of their side effects (see below), steroids aren't a long-term medication option. Over time, if your child's symptoms and lab work are improving, the dose will be tapered off.  Maintenance medications The goal for your child's long-term treatment will be another kind of immunosuppressant called a “steroid-sparing\" maintenance medication. There are several types of maintenance medications that doctors use to treat lupus in children. The one your doctor chooses often depends on which part of your child's body has disease activity.  Some examples of maintenance medications include: \t Mycophenolate mofetil —a daily oral medication\t Azathioprine —a daily oral medication\t Tacrolimus —a daily oral medication\t Belimumab —a monthly intravenous (IV) medication  If your child's disease is more severe, your pediatric rheumatologist may recommend treatment with a stronger IV immunosuppressant that's normally used to treat some kinds of cancer. These medications have also been shown to be effective in treating severe, active lupus and they include:\t Cyclophosphamide\t Rituximab   For kids with severe arthritis symptoms, your doctor might prescribe an immunosuppressant that's used to treat juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) such as:\t Methotrexate —either an oral medication or an injection\t Biologic medications  such as     abatacept  or     tocilizumab —either an injection or an IV infusion  Methotrexate shouldn't be given to children whose kidneys are affected by lupus, which is called    lupus nephritis .  Non-immunosuppressants \t Hydroxychloroquine— A daily oral medication that's used along with steroids and/or maintenance medications, hydroxychloroquine is in a group of medications called antimalarials. It has been shown to help prevent lupus flares and treat skin and joint symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)—​NSAIDs like ibuprofen or naproxen can also be used along with other medications for children who have arthritis. If your child has lupus nephritis, NSAIDs aren't a good choice because they can cause kidney damage. What are the side effects of all these medications? Steroids Your child will likely need to be on steroids at some point. But since using steroids for a long period of time increases the chances of serious side effects, your doctor will take your child off them as soon as possible.  Possible side effects of steroids include: Weight gain Increased appetite Elevated blood sugar High blood pressure Weak bones Mood changes Glaucoma Cataracts Stomach upset  While your child is on steroids, taking calcium and vitamin D supplements every day can help prevent bone damage, and an over-the-counter acid-reducer can help minimize an upset stomach.  Maintenance immunosuppressants Children need to be monitored with regular exams and bloodwork while taking maintenance immunosuppressants like mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, tacrolimus, belimumab, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab.  Side effects of these medications may include: Allergic reactions Gastrointestinal issues like abdominal pain, nausea, or diarrhea Changes in blood test results Depression Injection site reactions (for injected medications)  Cyclophosphamide has other specific potential side effects too, including:\t Hair loss —This may be prevented by putting ice caps on your child's scalp during the infusion.\t Fertility issues —Your doctor may discuss hormone treatment with you to help.\t Bladder problems —Your doctor will give your child another medication and fluids to prevent this.  All immunosuppressants Because steroids and other immunosuppressants stop parts of the immune system from working well, children taking these medications may have a higher risk for certain infections. It's important to consult with your pediatric rheumatologist if your child develops a fever while on these treatments.  Children on immunosuppressive medications can receive routine childhood vaccinations that are inactive, but they shouldn't receive “live\" vaccinations (for instance, vaccines for measles-mumps-rubella [MMR], varicella, rotavirus, or yellow fever). Live vaccinations may cause an active infection in your child because of their weakened immune system.  Some of these medications have been linked with developing cancer. This has been a big concern for many healthcare providers and parents, but since the research isn't clear, this link has been controversial.  If you have questions, be sure to talk to your child's pediatrician or pediatric rheumatologist. Hydroxychloroquine Hydroxychloroquine is generally well tolerated with minimal side effects. The most serious side effect of long-term use of hydroxychloroquine is damage to the retina, which is in the back of the eye. This risk increases the longer your child takes the medication, so they will need to see an eye specialist called an ophthalmologist to be closely monitored. All medications Some of these medications may be harmful to a developing fetus during pregnancy, so sexually active adolescent females need to be aware of these risks and be on some type of birth control. Ideally, these birth control treatments shouldn't contain estrogen, because this could increase the risk of blood clots. What other types of medication are given to patients with lupus? Depending on your child's lupus symptoms, additional medications may be used along with any of the above medications. For instance, if your child has skin rashes, medications that are applied to the skin may be prescribed. Children with lupus nephritis may need medications to lower their blood pressure. Blood thinners might be prescribed for kids who have had blood clots.  Remember Talk with your child's doctor if you have any questions about any medications your child is taking, or any other concerns about their health.

        "content": "Diabetes  is a disease that affects the way the body uses food for energy. There are different types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is one of the most common childhood chronic diseases. It affects about 1 in 400 children, adolescents and young adults under 20 years of age. Currently, once diagnosed, type 1 diabetes is a lifelong disease with no known cure. However, there are very effective treatments for type 1 diabetes. What causes type 1 diabetes? Type 1 diabetes happens when the body cannot make enough insulin. Nutrients in food are changed into a form of sugar called glucose. Insulin allows glucose to move from the bloodstream into the cells to be used for energy. Without insulin,    glucose  is \"stuck\" in the bloodstream. This leads to a high level of glucose in the blood, which can cause damage in the body. Ordinarily, our bodies produce insulin is produced in special cells (called beta cells) in the pancreas, which is an organ in the belly. But with type 1 diabetes, the immune system gets confused and destroys beta cells as if they were harmful germ that got into the body. This ongoing attack may occur quickly or over a period of years. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes The symptoms of type 1 diabetes a child may experience largely result from: the lack of energy caused by the body not being able to use the nutrients eaten. the high sugar levels in the bloodstream pulling water from the body into the bloodstream and spilling into the urine, causing    dehydration  (lack of fluids). Type 1 diabetes symptoms in children include: hunger, at times extreme, associated with weight loss. increased thirst and increased urination (peeing). This can be missed in infants who are not toilet trained, because parents may not realize that they are in need of more    frequent diaper changes . Also,    \"accidents\" in a toddler and older children  previously toilet trained may be overlooked. fatigue or feeling tired. irritability or unusual behavior. blurry vision (not a common symptom, but this can occur if the sugar is very high). If untreated, the following symptoms can occur that require immediate medical care: Nausea Vomiting Belly pain Rapid breathing and drowsiness Loss of consciousness How is type 1 diabetes diagnosed? Type 1 diabetes is diagnosed when a child has classic symptoms of diabetes as described above, along with abnormally high blood sugar levels and ketones in the urine. Ketones are acids that build up in the body when there is not enough insulin. Diabetes can also be diagnosed by a test that shows what the average blood sugar has been in the blood over the previous 3 months. This test is called hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). A result that is equal to or greater than 6.5% suggests diabetes. If you are worried that your child may have symptoms of type 1 diabetes: Bring your child to see their pediatrician right away. The doctor can easily check for sugar in the urine. They can also take a drop of blood from the finger to check the blood sugar level with a glucose meter (a small portable machine).  It may be tempting to borrow a borrow a glucose meter from a relative or friend to check your child's blood sugar, but we advise against this. You may not do it correctly, and the home meter may not be working properly.  Before a child develops full-blown type 1 diabetes, a phase of    prediabetes  may be present. This measures differently. How is type 1 diabetes treated? Diabetes can be treated by giving back the very hormone that is missing: insulin.  Insulin may be given as several daily injections with small syringes with very thin and short needles that make the injections almost pain-free. Insulin injections are most commonly given in the upper part of the arms, in the front of the thighs, and in the fatty skin of the belly.  Insulin can also be given continuously via a small machine (often referred to as a \"pump\") that gives insulin through a small plastic tube (called a \" catheter \"), which can be inserted by the parent or the affected child. What is an islet transplant? Islets are clusters of cells in the pancreas. They contain the insulin-producing beta cells that are destroyed with type 1 diabetes.  Pancreatic islet cell transplantation  is an experimental treatment for the disease. However, it may only be performed as part of a  clinical trial  and it is not without risks. Managing type 1 diabetes Treatment for type 1 diabetes is aimed at normalizing blood sugar levels. However, this is not a simple task, and blood sugars must be checked several times daily.  Blood sugar can be measured by obtaining a small drop of blood using a very fine device called a lancet. The drop of blood is then put on a strip and inserted into a home glucose meter. Some people with insulin pumps also wear  continuous glucose monitors . These devices measure the levels of sugar in the fatty space under the skin. A    healthy diet  is also very important in type 1 diabetes, and insulin dosing needs to be matched with the amount of sugar (called carbohydrate) taken in. Being    physically active  is also key, and insulin often needs to be reduced at times of physical activity. Can type 1 diabetes be prevented or delayed?\t Relatives of people with type 1 diabetes  are at higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes, compared with children and young adults who do not have any relatives with type 1 diabetes in their extended family.  Diabetes cannot be predicted with certainty. However, special blood tests are available to measure the risk of diabetes. These tests measure proteins called antibodies that are associated with type 1 diabetes. For people who are found to have those antibodies and who are having some rise in their blood sugar, there is a medication that may be able to delay the onset of type 1 diabetes.

If your child has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, your child's doctor will talk with you about the importance of lifestyle and medication in keeping your child's blood glucose (blood sugar) levels under control. \t About Blood Glucose\t Glucose  is found in the blood and is the body's main source of energy. The food your child eats is broken down by the body into glucose. Glucose is a type of sugar that gives energy to the cells in the body.\t The cells need the help of insulin to take the glucose from the blood to the cells. Insulin is made by an organ called the pancreas. \t In children with type 2 diabetes, the pancreas does not make enough insulin and the cells don't use the insulin very well.\t Managing Blood Glucose Levels\t Glucose will build up in the blood if it cannot be used by the cells. High blood glucose levels can damage many parts of the body, such as the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart.\t Your child's blood glucose levels may need to be checked on a regular schedule to make sure the levels do not get too high. Your child's doctor will tell you what your child's blood glucose level should be. You and your child will need to learn how to use a glucose meter. Blood glucose levels can be quickly and easily measured using a glucose meter. First, a lancet is used to prick the skin; then a drop of blood from your child's finger is placed on a test strip that is inserted into the meter.\t Medicines for Type 2 Diabetes\t Insulin  in a shot or another medicine by mouth may be prescribed by your child's doctor if needed to help control your child's blood glucose levels. If your child's doctor has prescribed a medicine, it's important that your child take it as directed. Side effects from certain medicines may include bloating or gassiness. Check with your child's doctor if you have questions.\t Along with medicines, your child's doctor will suggest changes to your child's diet and encourage your child to be physically active. \t Tips for Healthy Living\t A healthy diet and staying active are especially important for children with type 2 diabetes. Your child's blood glucose levels are easier to manage when you child is at a healthy weight.\t Create a Plan for Eating Healthy\t Talk with your child's doctor and registered dietitian about a meal plan that meets the needs of your child. The following tips can help you select foods that are healthy and contain a high content of nutrients (protein, vitamins, and minerals):\t Eat at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day.\t Include high-fiber,  whole-grain  foods such as brown rice, whole-grain pasta, corns, peas, and breads and cereals at meals. Sweet potatoes are also a good choice.\t Choose lower-fat or fat-free toppings like grated low-fat parmesan cheese, salsa, herbed cottage cheese, nonfat/low-fat gravy, low-fat sour cream, low-fat salad dressing, or yogurt. \t Select lean meats such as skinless chicken and turkey, fish, lean beef cuts (round, sirloin, chuck, loin, lean ground beef—no more than 15% fat content), and lean pork cuts (tenderloin, chops, ham). Trim off all visible fat. Remove skin from cooked poultry before eating.\t Include healthy oils such as canola or olive oil in your diet. Choose margarine and vegetable oils without trans fats made from canola, corn, sunflower, soybean, or olive oils.\t Use nonstick vegetable sprays when cooking.\t Use fat-free cooking methods such as baking, broiling, grilling, poaching, or steaming when cooking meat, poultry, or fish.\t Serve vegetable and broth-based soups, or use nonfat (skim) or low-fat (1%) milk or evaporated skim milk when making cream soups. \t Use the  Nutrition Facts label  on food packages to find foods with less saturated fat per serving. Pay attention to the serving size as you make choices. Remember that the percent daily values on food labels are based on  portion sizes  and calorie levels for adults.\t Create a Plan for Physical Activity\t Physical activity , along with proper nutrition, promotes lifelong health. Following are some ideas on how to get fit:\t Encourage your child to be active at least 1 hour a day. Active play is the best exercise for younger children! Parents can join their children and have fun while being active too. School-aged child should participate every day in 1 hour or more of moderate to vigorous physical activity that is right for their age, is enjoyable, and involves a variety of activities.\t Limit television  watching and computer use. The AAP discourages TV and other media use by children younger than 2 years and encourages interactive play. For older children, total entertainment screen time should be limited to less than 1 to 2 hours per day.\t Keep an activity log. The use of activity logs can help children and teens keep track of their exercise programs and physical activity. Online tools can be helpful.\t Get the whole family involved. It is a great way to spend time together. Also, children who regularly see their parents enjoying sports and physical activity are more likely to do so themselves.\t Provide a safe environment. Make sure your child's equipment and chosen site for the sport or activity are safe. Make sure your child's clothing is comfortable and appropriate.",

        "content": "​​​​​​​​​Babies grow fast, and their heads are made for this quick growth.  Flexible skulls can protect a baby's growing brain, which roughly doubles in size during the first year. But if a baby's skull shape seems different, he or she may need helmet therapy.​ What is helmet therapy? Helmet therapy (also called helmet orthosis) is a treatment that's prescribed to help mold the baby's skull into shape.  Babies skulls are made of many bony plates. The plates are joined by fiber-like pieces called sutures. Sutures help the skull protect the baby's brain. They also allow some flexibility and space so that the brain can grow. To work, molding helmets must be worn during the time when the skull and brain are actively growing. Helmets will not help after brain growth is done, and three-fourths of brain growth happens by age 2. What conditions cause a baby to need a helmet?\t Positional skull deformity .  Deformational plagiocephaly, brachycephaly and NICUcephaly are three conditions that cause a baby's skull shape to change. They are caused by pressure on the skull when an infant spends a lot of time in one position.  Craniosynostosis .  This condition is caused when bony plates in the skull are abnormally fused together. As the brain grows in a child with craniosynostosis, the shape of the head becomes abnormal as the brain pushes out on the other parts of the skull. In some cases, the brain growth may be affected, as well. Craniosynostosis requires surgery and may be followed by helmet therapy. Some children with craniosynostosis may have other     developmental needs .  Is helmet therapy the only treatment for a child with a positional skull deformity?  It depends. If the condition is not severe, changing your baby's usual positions or starting physical therapy may help.  If an infant has moderate or severe positional skull deformity that doesn't respond to changing positions, or if the baby is older, helmet therapy may be prescribed. A positional skull deformity does not affect a child's brain development or cause any other medical condition. But not correcting it may affect the child's social    well-being  when he or she is older. Physical therapy and stretching and strengthening exercises are especially helpful for babies with    torticollis , which is present in about 20% of babies with positional flattening. This occurs when the baby's neck muscles are tighter and more contracted on one side. Torticollis causes the baby's neck to turn in a twisted position, which makes the baby's head to tilt one way and the chin to point the other way.  What is the first step to get a helmet?  A pediatrician may recommend a helmet after evaluating your baby's head shape. A referral is to someone who is trained to properly measure and fit the helmet is necessary. What can I expect during helmet therapy?  A baby's head shape is measured, and a custom-fitted helmet is designed. This is so the helmet can properly support your baby's skull while allowing the head to gradually grow and round out on its own.  Babies usually wear their helmets for 23 hours each day. Most children quickly get used to wearing them. The helmet should be taken off when it's time for    your baby's bath . It should be cleaned at that time. Problems such as skin irritation, discomfort, and bad odor should not occur. If there are problems, the helmet should be adjusted by the specialist who made it.  At what age should a baby with a positional skull deformity begin wearing a helmet? A baby that starts helmet therapy at a younger age may wear the helmet for less time. The results of therapy also may be better.  Babies referred for helmets at a later age (e.g., after 8 months), or after position changes and physical therapy did not help can still get helmets. However, they may have to wear them for a longer time than if they had started at a younger age.  How long does helmet therapy take? Every child is different. A lot depends on the child's age when he or she started helmet therapy. In early infancy, a baby's brain and skull grow very quickly. This means that the helmet can direct growth in less time. The specialist will check your child's progress at each visit to see if the head shape is improving. Children may need to wear a helmet for several months. Some children may benefit from more time and a second helmet.

        "content": "​\t One in every 700 babies is born with a cleft lip, a cleft palate, or both—making it one of the most common birth defects. Babies born with a cleft lip and/or palate need special care from a team of different health professionals. Their care must be well managed because of the difficult medical, surgical, dental and social factors important to treatment decisions. To help pediatricians better manage children with cleft lip/palate, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published the clinical report, \" The Primary Care Pediatrician and the Care of Children with Cleft Lift and/or Cleft Palate . \"\t The following information explains these recommendations to parents and families involved in caring for a baby born with a cleft lip and/or palate. Different types of cleft lip and/or palate The type of cleft lip and/or palate a child has will determine the kind of care that he or she needs. A    cleft lip  means that there is a gap in the baby's lip. The cleft may be on one or both sides of the upper lip and may reach all the way to the nose. Often, a baby with a cleft lip may have a gap in the upper gum. A    cleft palate  has a gap in the roof of the mouth that connects to the nose. The    combination of a cleft lip with a cleft palate  is more common than just a cleft lip or just a cleft palate.\t \t \t   Detecting cleft lip  and/or palate Many, but not all, parents know in advance that their newborn infant will have a cleft lip from the    prenatal ultrasound . The mother's doctor or the baby's future doctor can help parents meet with experts— called a cleft/craniofacial team . Prenatal consultation involves parents meeting various members of the cleft/craniofacial team and learning about the care of children born with cleft lip. Normally, a cleft palate is not seen until after a baby has been born. A nurse, a doctor, or a parent may notice that the top of the mouth looks different. The cleft palate may involve most or just the farthest part of the roof of the mouth. Common concerns from parents about cleft palates Being the parent of a newborn with a cleft lip, cleft palate, or both can feel overwhelming. Simple things like feeding your baby might now be more complicated. Parents wonder how people may react when they see their baby has a cleft lip. Parents also worry how the cleft lip or cleft palate will affect their child long-term—socially and developmentally. If you are worrying about any of these things or others, talk with your child's pediatrician. They can help answer questions and even direct you to a parent support group near you. Feeding a baby with cleft lip and/or palate In general, babies with a cleft palate either as cleft lip with cleft palate or cleft palate alone, suck weakly and need a special bottle to feed. Support from a feeding therapist, certified lactation consultant, and/or nurse experienced in feeding children with cleft palate is recommended for parents. A baby born with a cleft lip without cleft palate may also need extra help with feeding. However, most babies with cleft lip can feed from the breast or a normal bottle. This is also true for babies with cleft lip and cleft gum. Care & treatment from the cleft/craniofacial team Various specialists will care for your child at different times and stages. The cleft/craniofacial team usually includes nurses, social workers, nutritionists, audiologists, speech-language pathologists,    geneticists , pediatricians,    dentists , orthodontists and pediatric surgeons ( otolaryngologists , oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and    plastic surgeons ). These providers understand common concerns and know the answers to parents' questions. \t First appointment:  A newborn should see their cleft/craniofacial team within one week (or as soon as possible) from the day they first leave the hospital. In the beginning, the team will make sure the baby is feeding and growing well. The team will also check for other medical problems common in babies with a cleft lip or palate, answer parents' questions, and discuss the next steps for treatment.\t Surgery:  Surgical repair of a child's cleft is one part of the care that the cleft/craniofacial team provides.    When will my child need surgery for their cleft? The most common question parents have is,    \"When will my child have surgery to repair his or her cleft lip or cleft palate?\"  The AAP recommends initial reconstructive surgeries for cleft lip or cleft palate occur within the first year of life.\t Cleft lip repair:  A cleft lip usually is repaired between 3 and 6 months of age. Many things will determine the right time for surgery; the right time for one child may not be good for another.\t Cleft palate repair:  A cleft palate is commonly fixed between 9 and 14 months of age. If there is a separation in the gum line, it usually is repaired when a child is 8-10 years of age. A child's cleft/craniofacial team will determine the best time for cleft palate surgery.\t Every child is different:  Children with cleft lip and/or cleft palate often need additional surgeries and treatments as they grow. For example, they may need braces during childhood. Each child will need different numbers and types of surgeries—why individualized coordination of care is so important. Most children born with clefts will need regular visits to their cleft/craniofacial team until they are adults.  What does a cleft look like before and after surgery? It is common for parents to worry about how their child will look before and after the cleft lip and/or palate repair.

        "content": "Of the 1% to 2% of babies born with congenital defects, 10% are born with malformations to the hand. These anomalies occur in early pregnancy and are sometimes diagnosed by ultrasound during pregnancy. When they are not, they often come as a surprise to parents. The cause of congenital hand anomalies is unknown.  Depending on the type and extent of a hand malformation, some babies may have little trouble adapting and functioning well. Others, however, may face various challenges as they grow and learn:   Developmental problems such as delayed or deficient  motor skills Difficulties with activities of daily living activities and basic self-care skills Limitations on certain types of exercises and sports Potential emotional and social harm from childhood teasing about appearance If child is functioning well and is happy, treatment is not always necessary. If a child is having difficulty doing the things he or she wants to do because of a hand malformation, treatment options may be available. Treatment Options The most important goal of any treatment for hand malformations is to help a child function as independently as possible. Your pediatrician will often provide referrals to  pediatric plastic surgeons  or  pediatric orthopedic surgeons . Treatment may involve:  Orthotics (splints or braces) Prosthetics (artificial limbs)  Physical therapy Surgery  Types of Hand Malformations Pediatric plastic and orthopedic surgeons diagnose and treat children with all types of hand malformations. There are many types. The following are those most often seen. Extra Digits (Polydactyly) Polydactyly is the most common congenital hand deformity. It affects boys and girls equally. A baby born with polydactyly has more than five fingers on one hand. An extra finger is often a small piece of soft tissue that can be simply removed. Sometimes, the extra finger contains bones but not joints. Very rarely, the extra finger is a fully functioning digit. A baby may be born with several extra fingers. There are different types of polydactyly: Preaxial polydactyly:  Involves having an extra thumb. It is more common in Caucasians. A pediatric surgeon can remove the extra bone and skin and repair the tendons. Postaxial polydactyly:  Involves having extra fingers on the opposite (the \"pinkie\" side). It is more common in African-Americans. These may occur as complete, separate fingers or just as small stumps. Stumps can be treated by a hand specialist in the office.  Central polydactyly:  Extra fingers can be located between center fingers, although this is less common.  Fused Fingers (Syndactyly) Syndactyly is one of the most common birth defects of the upper limbs—seen in as many as 1 in every 2,000 live births. This condition occurs when two or more fingers fail to separate when a baby is in the womb—resulting in \"webbed\" fingers at birth. It usually involves the middle and ring fingers. Syndactyly affects twice as many boys as girls. There is often a family history, and these cases often involve both fingers and toes. Surgery is generally needed before a child is 18 months old to separate the fingers or toes and may require extra skin to be taken from a separate area on the body, depending on the extent the fingers were joined. Categories of the condition include: Complete syndactyly:  The skin is fused all the way to the tip of affected fingers or toes. Incomplete syndactyly:  The fingers or toes are joined only part of the way to the tips. Simple syndactyly:  The fingers or toes are joined by skin and soft tissue only. Complex syndactyly:  The bones of fingers next to each other are fused.   Underdeveloped Hand (Symbrachydactyly) Babies born with symbrachydactyly have small or missing fingers. They also may have webbed fingers or a short hand or forearm. Mild symbrachydactyly:  The hand has slightly short, mobile fingers with minor webbing. The hand bones and some of the finger bones and the thumb are present.  Moderate symbrachydactyly:  Most or all of the finger bones are missing, and the baby has small projections of skin and soft tissue. The thumb is usually present, but it may be short.  Severe symbrachydactyly:  The baby has either a partial thumb or no thumb and no fingers. Club Hand Babies born with club hand are partially or completely missing one of the two long bones that make up the forearm—the radius or the ulna. As a result, the forearm may be shorter than normal. The hand turns inward, causing limited range of motion at the wrist. A child with the condition may have trouble performing tasks that require his or her hands.  The condition is usually more prominent on one side of the hand or the other—the radial (thumb) side or the ulnar (little finger) side. Radial club hand:  Children with club hand on the radial side (radial dysplasia) often have a short forearm and wrist curved toward the thumb side. Once a baby is between 6 and 12 months of age, surgery may be recommended to straighten the forearm bone and to fix the tendons. The condition may also be related to other medical syndromes such as  Fanconi anemia ,  Holt-Oram syndrome , and  VATER syndrome . Ulnar club hand:  This condition is less common than radial club hand and is usually unrelated to other syndromes. It can range from mild to more severe cases with the baby's wrist to be in a fixed and bent position toward the little-finger side of the hand. The thumb by be deformed or absent. Cleft Hand (Ectrodactyly) Cleft hand (also called ectrodactyly or split hand) is when the middle part of the hand develops abnormally. Babies with this condition are missing one or more central fingers on the hand. There are generally two types: Typical cleft hand:  V-shaped and usually missing or partially missing middle fingers. Both hands are usually affected, and sometimes the feet are, too. There is often a family history of this type of cleft hand. Atypical cleft hand:  U-shaped and usually involves only one hand. This type of cleft hand is not often inherited. Atypical cleft hand may be a symptom of  Poland syndrome . Small (Hypoplastic) Thumbs A hypoplastic thumb did not fully form in the womb or was missing altogether at birth. Treatment depends on how secure or stable the joint is that connects the base of the thumb to the wrist.  Children with stable joints tend to use the thumbs in regular play. Children whose have unstable joints tend to ignore the thumb.  For stable thumb-wrist joints, reconstructive surgery is generally recommended to build up the thumb and its tendons. For loose or floating unstable joints, the small thumb is removed and the index finger is converted to a thumb. Trigger Thumb Sometimes babies are born with an abnormality of the tendon in the thumb that makes it difficult for it to bend it. This condition may disappear on its own by about age 1. Other times, surgical correction may be recommended before age 3 to release the tendon and allow for the thumb to properly function.​",

        "content": "​All people have asymmetric faces. When one looks closely, these differences become more apparent. However, there are conditions in children in which the normal minor differences are much more significant.  Craniofacial Microsomia  Children born with this congenital condition have one half of the face that didn't develop as well as the other. It occurs during fetal development.  Common affected areas:\t Ear:  Anything from a change in shape to an absent ear\t Ear canal:  May be absent with decreased hearing as a result\t Lower jaw (mandible) : Less growth, chin point to side of decreased growth, and abnormal bite\t Facial movement:  A single nerve (facial nerve) with many branches controls facial movement, and one or more of these may be affected\t Eye socket and/or eye:  May be small or absent. Whatever the child is born with, he/she will maintain, but it will not get worse with growth. These children are cared for by a craniofacial team, including a pediatric plastic surgeon, ENT surgeon, speech therapist, dentist, and orthodontist. Surgery may be needed to help the jaw grow and to reconstruct the ear. Why this condition occurs is not fully understood, although genetic and environmental factors are both likely. Congenital Facial Nerve Palsy On each side of the face, there is one main facial nerve with several branches that travel to the muscles of facial expression. Children can be born with a deficiency of this nerve, usually on one side. Sometimes both nerves are affected. This is a rare problem.  The causes of congenital facial nerve palsy are usually birth trauma or developmental.  ​ Developmental:  When one side is affected, it is typically seen as muscular weakness, with difficulties raising the eyebrow, closing the eye, feeding difficulties, or smiling on the affected side. A bilateral (both sides) form of this problem is known as Mobius Syndrome. Mobius syndrome is a congenital paralysis of the muscle of facial expression, usually due to deficiency of the facial nerve as well as one of the nerves controlling movement of the eye.\t Birth trauma:  90% of the cases related to birth trauma will improve without treatment. If it does not go away spontaneously, then based on the location of the nerve damage, a surgical procedure called a neurorrhapy (stitching nerve ends together) or nerve graft may be performed to restore normal nerve function. ​Aside from the inability to communicate to others with facial expression, children with facial nerve weakness/paralysis may have difficulty closing the eye on the affected side, and thus have eye irritation and/or corneal ulceration. Prolonged exposure can lead to infection or loss of vision.​ There are two forms of treatment:\t Eye protection:  A small weight is surgically placed into the upper eyelid on the affected side. This will make it easier to close the eye, with the goal of keeping the cornea protected, and the eye free of infection. \t Smile recreation:  The ability to smile can be restored either by transferring one of the surrounding muscles of the face to the corner of the mouth, or by implanting a new muscle taken from another part of the patient's body. With new muscle, arteries, veins, and nerves must be reconnected under a microscope to restore function. The nerve that powers the new muscle comes either from a chewing muscle on the same side of the face or from a normal facial nerve branch on the patient's other side. Acquired Facial Nerve Palsy Children can develop facial nerve weakness/paralysis during life due to trauma, tumors, or from a third condition called Bell's palsy. Bell's palsy is thought to result from a viral infection that affects the facial nerve, and therefore often results in a unilateral (one-sided) facial paralysis. With time, the nerve can regain function. Many children get full function back, while others regain only partial function. In the case of no return of function, treatment can be offered as described above for congenital cases.

        "content": "​Head tilt is a condition that causes a child to hold her head or neck in a twisted or otherwise abnormal position. She may lean her head toward one shoulder and, when lying on her stomach, always turn the same side of her face toward the mattress. This can cause her head to    flatten  on one side and her face to appear uneven or out of line. If not treated, head tilt may lead to permanent facial deformity or unevenness and to restricted head movement.  Most cases of head tilt are associated with a condition called torticollis, although in rare instances a head tilt can be due to other causes such as hearing loss, misalignment of the eyes,    reflux  (a flowing back of stomach acid into the esophagus), a throat or lymph node infection, or, very uncommonly, a brain tumor.  Acquired torticollis (due to injury or inflammation) This is more likely to occur in older children, up to the age of nine or ten. This type of torticollis usually results from an inflammation of the throat caused by an    upper respiratory infection , a sore throat, an injury, or some unknown factor. The swelling, for reasons still not known, causes the tissues surrounding the upper spine to loosen, allowing the vertebral bones to move out of normal position. When this happens, the neck muscles go into spasm, causing the head to tilt to one side. Onset of this condition is typically sudden and very painful. Congenital muscular torticollis  By far the most common cause of head tilt among children under age five is congenital torticollis. This condition commonly occurs due to positioning while the baby is still in the womb and rarely may occur during birth (particularly breech and difficult first-time deliveries).Whatever the cause, this condition usually is detected in the first six to eight weeks after birth, when the pediatrician notices tightness in one of the muscles of the neck. About half the time there may be a small lump in the muscle. The affected muscle is the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which connects the breastbone, head, and neck. Later the muscle contracts and causes the head to tilt to one side and look toward the opposite side.  Treatment Each type of head tilt requires different treatment. It is very important to seek such treatment early, so that the problem is corrected before it causes permanent deformity. Your pediatrician will examine your child's neck and may order X-rays of the area in order to identify the cause of the problem. X-rays or ultrasound of the hip also may be ordered, as some children with congenital muscular torticollis also have an abnormality known as developmental    dysplasia of the hip .  If the doctor decides that the problem is congenital muscular torticollis, you will learn an exercise program to stretch the neck muscles. The doctor will show you how to gently move your child's head in the opposite direction from the tilt. You'll need to do this several times a day, very gradually extending the movement as the muscle stretches.  When your child sleeps, it is best to place her    on her back  with her head positioned opposite to the direction of the tilt. In rare instances, your pediatrician may suggest adjustments to her sleep position. When she is awake, position her so those things she wants to look at (windows, mobiles, pictures, and activity) are on the side away from the injury. In that way, she'll stretch the shortened muscle while trying to see these objects. Your pediatrician may also recommend placing her on her stomach while awake and turning her face away from the affected side. These simple strategies cure this type of head tilt in the vast majority of cases, preventing the need for later surgery. (Your pediatrician may refer your child to a physical therapist to help work on this condition.) If the problem is not corrected by exercise or position change, your pediatrician will refer you to a    pediatric neurologist  or orthopedist. In some cases, it may be necessary to lengthen the involved tendon surgically. If your child's head tilt is caused by something other than congenital muscular torticollis and the X-rays show no spinal abnormality, other treatment involving rest, a special collar, gentle stretching, massage, traction, application of heat to the area, medication, or, rarely, further imaging or surgery may be necessary.  For treating torticollis due to injury or inflammation, your doctor may recommend applying heat, as well as using massage and stretching to ease head and neck pain. Your pediatrician can refer you to a specialist for a definitive diagnosis and treatment program.

        "content": "Sometimes babies are born with a small lower jaw. It is called      micrognathia , which means \"small mandible.\" It can occur in isolation, but is also a symptom of a variety of craniofacial conditions. Micrognathia may interfere with a child's feeding and breathing. For example, infants with this condition may need special nipples and positioning in order to feed properly. Outcomes for children with micrognathia are generally good, but can vary depending on the severity of the condition. Infants  Micrognathia can appear in infants by itself or as part of a      syndrome  (where more than one body system is involved). A syndrome may be      inherited  (passed down from the parents) or come about spontaneously. Pierre Robin Sequence  A small jaw is often seen as part of      Pierre Robin Sequence . Pierre Robin occurs in about one per 8,500 live births. It is called a \"sequence,\" because while the baby is growing in the womb, the lower jaw does not grow enough. This causes the tongue to be pushed back and the palate bones to remain separated in the middle. Babies born with Pierre Robin may have difficulty with breathing, feeding, and/or sleeping. It can be a very mild problem to quite severe. \t Babies born with mild forms of Pierre Robin  will be discharged home with close follow up in the pediatrician's office. Parents are advised to keep a close watch on their baby due to partial airway blockage associated with obstructive         sleep apnea . These infants may also have trouble feeding and suffer from         gastrointestinal reflux . \t Babies born with more severe forms Pierre Robin  can't leave the hospital after birth and need extra measures to protect their breathing. A breathing tube attached to a ventilator may be needed temporarily.  Obstructive Sleep Apnea  The airway is at the most risk for blockage at night when all the muscles are relaxed. When a child's tongue is in a backward position due to a small jaw, his or her attempts to breath when sleeping can be met with partial or complete blockage. This is called      obstructive sleep \t apnea . It occurs in about 2% of children.  Obstructive sleep apnea causes decreases in the blood's ability to carry oxygen to the developing organs, so it can interfere with development. In children with obstructive sleep apnea and micrognathia, surgical treatment of the airway can be an emergency.  Treatment of Micrognathia Early diagnosis and ongoing monitoring help with a multi-disciplinary team of specialists will determine the best time to medically or surgically intervene. If your baby has micrognathia, you may meet with:\t A pediatric otolaryngologist (ENT)\t A craniofacial plastic surgeon\t A pediatric geneticist\t A pediatric pulmonologist   If the child can tolerate it, a sleep study is done to see how bad his or her airway is obstructed. If the results are severe, then a formal airway evaluation by the pediatric ENT is done in the operating room to assess the anatomy of the upper airway.  Mandibular Distraction Osteogenesis\t Mandibular Distraction Osteogenesis (MDO) is a surgical procedure that makes the lower jaw larger by slowly lengthening the lower jaw bone.  The surgeon makes cuts on both sides of the lower jaw and attaches turning devices which expand the space in the bone cut. By turning the devices, the jaw moves forward (and with it, the tongue). The airway will then get bigger, and within a couple of weeks from the surgery, the breathing/sleeping problem will be improved. Risks for MDO surgery include damage to tooth buds, sensory nerve damage, facial nerve damage, relapse of the original condition, and infection. After 6 weeks, the new bone has formed and the devices are removed. Usually, the child can go home during this period of bone formation. Additional benefits of MDO are improved feeding, decreased reflux, and avoidance of a permanent breathing tube called a tracheostomy.  Childhood Concerns Regardless of whether or not a child undergoes MDO as an infant, he or she will need to be followed for: Jaw growth Dental (tooth) development Lower lip sensation Airway health Sometimes, a second (or even first) MDO is needed during childhood if breathing and sleep apnea problems persist. Many children born with micrognathia will eventually need      orthodontic care , as well. Some eventually require corrective jaw surgery after growth is complete in adolescence.   Additional Information: \t Sleep Apnea Detection\t Dental Health and Orthodontic Problems\t GERD/Reflux",

        "content": "​ By: Nicholas Bastidas, MD, FAAP Babys’ ears play a big role in helping them take in the world around them. They let them  hear  vibrations as sound, help them learn to talk, and even balance so they can begin to walk. As children get older, ear shape also can play a role in their social confidence. For babies born with structural abnormalities of the ears, a range of treatment options can help prevent these conditions from affecting a child's development. Taking Shape Of the roughly four million babies born in the United States each year, an estimated 15 percent or 600,000 of them have some abnormally shaped ears. Doctors used to believe that misshapen ears would correct on their own as a baby grew. Current research shows this is not the case, with about 70 percent of untreated ear deformities lasting into childhood. A better understanding of the cartilage that forms the outer ear, as well as advances in biomedical engineering, have led to more treatment options to correct ear abnormalities in children. Some treatments help a child's ears work properly, while others are more about making them look better. For example, surgery can rebuild parts of the ear that didn’t form fully and help a baby hear properly. For other cases, simple molding devices designed for infants to wear can help correct ear shape deformities. Types of Ear Abnormalities There are many different types of ear abnormalities, including: \t Prominent Ear : Ear sticking out more than 2 cm from the head\t Constricted (lop/cup) Ear : The outer rim of ear is rolled or folded. \t Cryptotia : When the upper rim of the ear is tucked underneath scalp skin.\t Stahl's Ear : Pointy shaped ear.\t Microtia : The outer ear is underdeveloped or small.\t Anotia : Missing ear.\t Congenital Earlobe Deformities : Split or double earlobes, sometimes with skin tags.\t Accessory Tragus (ear tag) : Bump of skin or cartilage in front of the ear. Non-Surgical Treatments Ears that are folded, stick out or are otherwise irregularly shaped can be a source of embarrassment and teasing for young children. It’s often why they may want surgical correction (called otoplasty). However, there are non-surgical treatments that can be done shortly after birth that can avoid the need for corrective surgery, which is often postponed until a child is around five years old and requires an operation under general anesthesia.\t Ear Molding . Using custom devices, pediatric plastic surgeons can mold the ears into a more “normal” shape, proportion or position. Generally, the earlier the ear is molded, the more successful the outcome. Less than three weeks of age is considered the ideal time to begin ear molding, though some improvement can still be achieved if started later.  There are several ear molding methods. One of the more common techniques involves placing a soft silicone cradle around the ear and applying plastic retainers to reshape the ear cartilage. The device is held on using tape and is worn for a period of 4-6 weeks. After the molding devices are removed, double sided tape may be placed to hold the position for another 2 weeks. An estimated 90 percent of all ear deformities can be corrected using this non-surgical method.  When Surgery Can Help\t Otoplasty . Older children with ear malformations may not benefit much from simple techniques such as ear molding. For these children, surgical options, such as otoplasty, are available. Otoplasty reshapes the outer ear using permanent stitches placed through a hidden scar behind the ear. This procedure is performed as an outpatient surgery in early childhood after the ear has completed most of its growth.\t Reconstructive surgery . Ear deformities such as microtia (small ears) may need more complex reconstruction procedures. Microtia reconstruction is often performed in two or three operations by pediatric plastic surgeons. The surgeons use either cartilage from the rib or a synthetic material such as porous polyethylene to build or shape the ears.  Ear reconstruction is usually delayed until a child is 6 to 10 years old when using rib cartilage, and 3 to 5 years old if synthetic material is used. An artificial, prosthetic ear may also be an option. The ear canal may be missing in children with microtia. As a result, these children may benefit from a bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA) to improve the quality of hearing. Related Conditions Ear abnormalities such as microtia sometimes are related to      congenital disorders  that may affect the other parts of the child's body such as the kidneys or other organs, so your pediatrician may recommend an      ultrasound  or other tests.

        "content": "By \t Peter J. Taub, MD, FAAP, FACS It is not unusual for a baby's head to look a little lopsided. Because the individual bones of a newborn's skull aren't yet fused together, pressure from resting in the same position can cause an infant's head to be misshapen. This may include a flattened area.  While an asymmetrical head shape is a common cause of concern for new parents, a baby's head typically rounds out after birth. Flat spots may also improve, especially with position changes and extra    tummy time  during play. If the deformation is moderate or severe and not responding to position changes,  helmet therapy  may help. Less commonly, an uneven head shape happens when the bones of the skull fuse together too soon. This rare condition, called craniosynostosis, may require surgery both to correct the head shape abnormality and in some cases to give the baby's brain room it needs to grow. It is estimated that about 1 in every 2,000 U.S. babies is born with craniosynostosis.  Baby's head: a brainy design  The soft, flexible spaces between a baby's six separate bones of the head, called \"sutures,\" do more than help the head squeeze through the birth canal. They also allow the skull to expand rapidly during the first year of life, when the baby's brain more than doubles in size.  With craniosynostosis, two or more bones fuse together before a baby's brain growth is completed—sometimes even before birth. Depending on which of the sutures close early, and where they are located, the shape of the skull, brain and face can become distorted.  How is craniosynostosis diagnosed?  To help determine what's causing a baby's uneven head shape, pediatricians will talk with parents to piece together a developmental and family history. They will also conduct careful examinations, looking at the baby's head and face from several different angles as they search for raised or flattened areas and noting any asymmetry. This may be easier when the baby's hair is wet.  These observations and information will help differentiate positional plagiocephaly (caused by simple pressure in one area) from craniosynostosis (caused by bony fusion).  One sign a baby's uneven head shape was caused by position alone is the classic parallelogram shape. One side of the head may appear to be pushed forward, with the back of the head being flattened, the ear moved slightly forward, and the forehead pushed slightly forward on the same side compared with the opposite side. Your doctor may gently place a finger in each ear and note the position of their fingers relative to each other as observed from above the baby's head. In the case of positional plagiocephaly, the two fingers will not line up opposite each other. Plagiocephaly is more common on the right side, and also shows up more often in male infants.  Types of craniosynostosis Skull bone sutures that fused too soon may be felt as ridges that run along various parts of the baby's head. The baby's particular head shape will also point to the specific suture involved. Some of the more commonly seen types of head shapes, with the involved sutures, include:\t Scaphocephaly:  A long, narrow head is common with midline \"sagittal\" synostosis, when the suture extending from front to back over the top of the head fuses too soon. Sagittal synostosis is the most common form of craniosynostosis, accounting for about 40% to 45% of cases.\t Trigonocephaly:  A forehead that is pinched on the sides with a ridge running from the bridge of the nose to the soft spot on top of the head signals a \"metopic\" synostosis. \t Anterior Plagiocephaly:  An asymmetric head and face with a flattened forehead, a raised eyebrow, and a deviated nose can result from \"coronal\" synostosis on one side. \t Brachycephaly:  A flatted and/or tall forehead, usually with pronounced flattening of the cheeks, a small upturned or \"beaked\" nose, and bulging eyes from \"coronal\" synostosis on both sides. This is often present in medical syndromes that involve the face and skull\t Posterior Plagiocephaly:  An asymmetric head with a pronounced ridge on the back of the head and a large bump behind the ear may result from \"lambdoid\" synostosis, which is the rarest form. Surgery for craniosynostosis Craniosynostosis usually requires surgery, both to correct the deformity and, in some cases, to avoid pressure inside the skull as the baby's brain grows. Extra tummy time and \"molding\" with a    helmet  can correct    positional skull deformities ; however, they are not, in themselves, effective in correcting craniosynostosis (although they are sometimes used after surgery). Children with craniosynostosis are referred to specialists that include plastic craniofacial surgeons and pediatric neurosurgeons, and other experts who work as a team. These specialists are often able to make the correct diagnosis by examining your child but will arrange detailed imaging procedures, such as computed tomography (CT scans) ,before recommending surgery.  Depending how old the baby was when diagnosed with craniosynostosis and which suture is involved, different surgical options are available to either remove or release the fused bone. Additional reconstructive procedures may include placing springs or screws in the affected bones and \"distraction\" devices that slowly separate bone and let the healing process gradually fill it in. Surgery for craniosynostosis should be performed in medical centers with experienced craniofacial teams and pediatric intensive care units. After surgery, children stay in the hospital one or more days and are monitored at follow-up doctor visits. Complications such as bleeding, infection and bone loss are relatively rare. Children who have these procedures usually grow and develop normally into adulthood.

        "content": "When a baby spends a lot of time in one position, it can cause the shape of their head to change. This is called a positional skull deformity.  For about 20% of babies, a positional skull deformity occurs when they are in the womb or in the birth canal. More often, it happens in the first 4 to 12 weeks of life. This is when babies are not able to sit up or move on their own. By 6 months of age, many babies become more    mobile  and can turn their heads on their own more regularly. What causes a baby's head shape to change? A    baby's skull  has soft, bony plates that haven't yet fused together. The bony plates can move a bit, which helps the baby's head to pass through the birth canal. The plates also allow room for the brain to grow during the first year of life.  There are many things that can cause a positional skull deformity, such as:\t Preferred head position.  Some babies like sitting or sleeping with their heads turned a certain way. \t Not enough tummy time.  Tummy time  is for babies who are awake and being watched. It helps babies master basic milestones like head lifting, turning over, sitting up, and crawling.\t Twin or triplet.  Cramped or unusual positions in the womb can lead to changes in head shape.\t Prematurity.  Lying flat on their backs in the hospital can cause a preemie's head to become misshapen.  Preemies  also have softer bones that are not as fully formed as the bones of full-term babies. \t Birth complications.  The baby's position when moving through the birth canal can affect his or her head shape. Some other things that affect a baby's head shape at birth are using forceps, vacuum extraction or even a difficult labor.\t Torticollis.  An estimated 85% of babies with    torticollis , a condition where the neck muscles are tight or imbalanced, have a positional skull deformity. Infants who have torticollis also will need physical therapy.  3 common misshapen head types A baby's head shape change usually is related to the position in which they spend the most time. Your pediatrician can determine whether your baby's head shape is caused by a positional skull deformity or an uncommon but more serious condition called    craniosynostosis . Common positional skull deformities do not require surgery.\t Deformational brachycephaly  is when the head is symmetrically (evenly) flat in the back and wide from side to side. The bone above the ears might seem to stick out. This is often seen in babies who spend a lot of  time on their backs  and do not get  enough tummy time . \t Deformational plagiocephaly  is when the head is asymmetrically (unevenly) flat in the back on one side. The forehead may be more prominent, causing the head to look like a parallelogram. The ear may also shift forward on the flat side. This is often seen in babies who prefer to sleep with their heads turned to one side and those with torticollis. \t NICUcephaly  is a common condition in preemies who spend their first few months of life in the  neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) . This positional skull deformity causes preemies to develop long, narrow heads.  A good time to check your baby's head is after bath time when their hair is wet.  The back of your baby's head  should be evenly round. Your baby's ears  should be even. The width of your baby's head  and forehead should be even and balanced. If you notice any changes or have any concerns, talk to your pediatrician.  What if my baby has a positional skull deformity? Positional skull deformities do not affect  brain growth  or intellectual development. They are purely cosmetic, and the majority do not require surgery. The best treatment is to prevent a positional skull deformity. And when it is found early, simple changes to your baby's position will help. For example:  Avoid too much time in a    car seat , bouncy seat, baby swing  or other carrier. These positions put pressure on the back of your baby's head. Increase tummy time.  It is important to put babies on their    backs to sleep . But a baby needs supervised time on their    tummy to play  during the day. This also lets your baby exercise their neck, back, shoulders, arms and hips. Start with short spurts of time. Gradually work up to an hour per day in several short sessions.  Switch or alternate arms  when holding and feeding your baby. Alternate which end you of the crib  you place your baby down for sleep.  Are infant \"head-shaping\" pillows safe?  No, head-shaping support pillows for babies are not safe. These products can create an unsafe  sleep environment  for babies and may contribute to  suffocation risk . In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  says  there is no evidence to show that these products are effective for positional skull deformities,  craniosynostosis  or any other medical purpose. Early intervention & therapy for positional skull deformity In some cases, your baby's doctor may recommend treatment for positional skull deformity, particularly those with moderate or severe head flattening. Physical therapy.  Your pediatrician may refer your baby for early intervention services and an evaluation from a pediatric physical therapist. The therapist will check your baby for    delayed motor skills  caused by poor head and neck control, and for torticollis. You will also learn stretching and positioning exercises to do with your baby at home. Depending on how severe the positional skull deformity is, your baby may need weekly therapy.   Helmet therapy.  If your baby has moderate or severe head flattening that does not respond to treatment by 5 or 6 months of age, they may benefit from  helmet therapy . Molding helmets work by re-shaping the baby's head. These helmets are fitted by a specialist.   Surgery  should only be considered when all other options have been exhausted. In addition, surgery should only be considered after consulting with a neurosurgeon or pediatric plastic surgeon who specializes in these types of cases.\t Remember Talk with your pediatrician if you have any questions or concerns about your baby's growth and development.

The updated COVID vaccine is recommended for kids age 6 months and older. Vaccination is the best way to prepare your child's immune system to recognize and resist COVID. The    American Academy of Pediatrics  (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) strongly recommend that all eligible children and teens get the COVID vaccine. You    or your child  may have questions about COVID prevention. Your pediatrician is here to help. Here's what you need to know. Which pediatric COVID vaccine should I choose? There are two COVID vaccines (from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) available for   babies and y​oung children. The AAP does not recommend one vaccine product over another. Children age 6 months through age 4 years need multiple doses of COVID vaccines to be   up to date—including at least one dose of updated COVID vaccine. Receiving the updated COVID vaccine helps your child's body develop immunity to protect them from serious illness, including from recent variants of the virus. Where can babies and young kids get a COVID vaccine? It is always best to    begin  with your child's pediatrician. Pediatricians are a trusted source, and they know your child best.\t If your child is not up to date on other vaccinations, ask to receive them with their COVID vaccine at the same visit.  The recommended immunizations help keep your child healthy, so their immune system is ready to respond to diseases like measles, polio, whooping cough and    the flu . If your child's pediatrician does not have the COVID vaccine, they can help you find a location that does. Depending on your child's age, the vaccine may be available through public health agencies, many clinic settings and pharmacies. For help accessing COVID vaccines, text your Zip code to 438829, visit    https://www.vaccines.gov ,  call 1-800-232-0233 or TTY 1-888-720-7489. Will my baby have side effects after the COVID shot? Most parents are familiar with minor side effects as their child's immune system learns to make antibodies against a disease. Side effects may include things like soreness and redness where the shot goes in. Some babies and children don't feel well later in the day of the shot or on the next day. A small number of children develop a fever—and very few get high fever. Usually, it lasts only a day or two while their immunity is building up. What if my infant or young child already had COVID? If your child had a COVID infection, they should still receive an updated COVID vaccination, according to CDC guidelines. It is possible to be infected again with the virus. Vaccines help protect your child by providing extra protection from COVID, even after they have had an infection. People who already had COVID and do not get vaccinated after they recover are more likely to get it again, compared with those who get vaccinated after they recover. Remember Just like the rest of us, babies and young kids deserve to get the same immune-boosting benefits against COVID. Plus, they are helping to keep others healthy. Infants under age 6 months are too young to get the vaccine. And they have the second-highest rate of    hospitalization  among all ages this respiratory season. That is why it is very important for    pregnant and breastfeeding  people—and all other people who are around babies—to protect the baby by getting vaccinated.

COVID vaccines have been updated to work better against strains of the virus that are currently circulating. Nearly all kids age 6 months and older are eligible for the 2024-2025 COVID vaccine—including those who received a COVID vaccine before and anyone who had COVID. The    American Academy of Pediatrics  (AAP) and the    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) recommend 2024-2025 COVID vaccines for everyone age 6 months and older. The vaccine equips your child's immune system to recognize and resist the virus. This helps to prevent serious disease and hospitalization from COVID. Even now, there are still a lot of children and teens being    hospitalized with COVID . Most did not have an underlying medical condition. There is no way to predict which children will be severely affected by COVID. Getting the updated COVID vaccine is the safest and most dependable way to    build immunity  and avoid serious illness. Recommended dose & type of COVID vaccine Updated COVID mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are available for kids age 6 months and older. If your child is at least 12 years old and cannot receive the mRNA vaccines, they may be eligible for the updated    protein subunit COVID vaccine  from Novavax. Babies and young children usually need more doses than older children and teens.    (See the chart below for details.)  Parents should note that additional    doses  of the 2024-2025 COVID vaccine may be recommended if a child has certain medical conditions or takes medicines that weaken the immune system. When is my child up to date?\t Children age 6 months through 4 years:   They are up to date when they get 3 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or 2 doses of Moderna vaccine. At least 1 dose should be an updated Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID vaccine.\t Children age 5 through 11 years are up to date when they get:  1 dose of updated Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. — OR — When they get 1 dose of updated Moderna COVID vaccine.\t Adolescents age 12 and older are up to date when they get: 1 dose of updated Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine — OR — 1 dose of updated Moderna vaccine — OR — 1 dose of updated Novavax vaccine (2 doses if previously unvaccinated).\t   Source:  AAP Pediatric COVID-19 Vaccine Dosing Quick Reference Guide, \t \t  https://aap.org/covidvaccineguide If your child has a medical condition or takes medicines that affect their immune system, ask your pediatrician whether your child's    recommended schedule  is different. Do kids need to wait to get the vaccine if they had COVID? Talk to your pediatrician about the best timing for vaccination following infection. If your child has an active COVID infection or had COVID between doses, they should wait to get vaccinated until they've recovered and are no longer contagious. Children who recently had COVID can consider delaying a COVID vaccine by up to 3 months. This is because there is a lower risk of getting sick with COVID again during that time. Don't let COVID slow your family down this fall. Pediatricians urge everyone to keep your immune system updated by getting the 2024-2025 COVID vaccine. People still should get the 2024-2025 COVID vaccine even if they had COVID. COVID vaccines have been shown to provide the strongest, broadest and most long-lasting    protection , both in people who have and who have not had COVID infection previously. Some people who become infected also may be at higher risk of long-term effects from their infection (known as    long COVID ). One thing is certain: COVID vaccines are the safest, most dependable way to prevent severe illness, hospitalization and death. Billions of people have received them. We are relieved that almost all children and teens can get the vaccines, so they can stay healthy and thrive.

It also helps make sure that your kids can keep attending child care, school and other activities that are so important for their physical and    mental health . Updated COVID vaccines are recommended for kids age 6 months and older. Hundreds of thousands of children and teens younger than 18 years old have been    hospitalized with COVID  since 2020.    COVID levels are    very high  across the U.S.  The vaccine provides broad protection against serious illness. Your child will be ready to resist infection—and it's an important way to protect the health of others. A vaccine for babies, kids & teens The COVID vaccine dose your child will get is based on their age. Your pediatrician can explain which vaccine is right for your baby, child or teen. They can also advise if or when your child should get another dose. Here's a checklist as you prepare for your child's COVID vaccination: ✅\t \t  Call your child's pediatrician \t to  schedule your child's COVID vaccine appointment.  Your child can also receive routine shots at the same appointment for the COVID shot.  Ask if your child is caught up on all \t   recommended immunizations . ✅\t   Talk with your child  before the  appointment . Many parents may have concerns about how their child might act when they    need a shot . But there are simple ways to help    make it a positive, calm experience .    ✅\t Schedule the next dose  (if needed) after your child receives their vaccine. Make sure that your pediatrician's office has    a record  of your child's COVID vaccination status. Your child's child care, preschool, school or college health office also may need a copy of the immunization record.  ✅\t If your child has a medical condition or takes medicine that weakens the immune system,    another dose may be recommended . Check with your pediatrician for details.  Remember Everyone age 6 months and older should receive at least one updated COVID vaccine to be considered up to date. Some people (6 months through 4 years or immunocompromised) may need more than one dose to be  considered up to date .

        "content": "By: Robert Sege, MD, PhD, FAAP All babies cry. Most babies cry a lot from two weeks to two months of age. Some    cry  more than others, and some cry longer than others. For many new parents, crying is one of the most stressful parts of coping with a newborn.    In some cases, extreme stress and a temporary lapse of emotional control in a caregiver can lead to actions that result in    abusive head trauma . In fact, the most common trigger for abusive head trauma is simply a crying baby. As an American Academy of Pediatrics  policy statement  points out, actions that lead to abusive head trauma often happen when caretakers    experience stress  and get to the end of their rope.  However, there is a bright side: The key to preventing actions that lead to abusive head trauma is to understand how common feelings of frustration, isolation, and exhaustion are during the first few months of an infant's life.  Helpful tips for parents of newborns Usually, new parents can seek out social supports and external help—but what happens when we are restricted in our movements and our contacts? What happens when families face childcare challenges or the need to isolate like saw during the  COVID-19  pandemic? Here are a few suggestions:\t Try all the soothing tricks.  Crying babies want to be  soothed . You may need to  try a few things , over and over, before they calm. Try holding them, feeding them,    swaddling  them, gently rocking them, singing to them. If these don't work, put the baby down and take a break. Be sure your baby is in a    safe sleep environment  (on their back on a firm sleep surface with a tight-fitting sheet, away from soft blankets, toys, pillows and other bedding materials). While some babies cry for a long time, many parents are surprised at how quickly babies will cry themselves to sleep.\t Pay attention to your own needs.  The challenges of new parents can certainly feel overwhelming sometimes. Rest as much as you can—try  sleeping  when the baby does. Find time for yourself when your partner or other caring adult watches the baby. Put on your headphones, give a friend or relative a call, have a cup of tea, or just relax. \t Connect with others.  Try video chats or social media to stay in touch. If you're a friend or relative on the receiving end of these calls, listen first before offering suggestions. Imagine you are with the young parent, they are crying on your shoulder, and you are offering reassurance without any words. Keeping this image in mind can help you provide the social support that all new parents need.\t Use your \"helpers.\"  Engage older siblings as much as you can by encouraging them to be your special helpers, so they can help out in developmentally appropriate ways. \t Seek help.  Depression is the most common mental illness in the United States. If you had a history of depression before your baby was born, you may be at higher risk for    postpartum depression . Speak with your provider sooner rather than later to help foresee this potential condition. Many doctors, nurses, and mental health providers are now set up for telehealth visits and may be able to help you by video or phone.\t Reach out.  If you are a friend, relative, or neighbor to a family with a newborn, this is the time to  reach out . Think about ways you can help. In addition to social support, can you buy diapers or other baby supplies? Can you drop off food or treats for the siblings or adults? Can you safely supervise older children outdoors? Maybe they could come along with you when you walk your dog!\t Help a co-worker out.  If you are a co-worker of a parent returning to work after parental leave, be kind and supportive. If you see or hear the baby on the call, say \"hi!\"\t Find a forum.  New parents may find it helpful to discuss their experiences with other new parents. In addition to seeking help from friends, relatives, neighbors, and medical professionals, look for discussion forums and communities of moms dedicated to sharing problems, stories, and tips with each other online (see the list of resources below).\t Your pediatrician is here to help.  Never hesitate to call for advice. Your pediatricians is an excellent resource for understanding your baby and your own needs, including those related to postpartum depression.\t Use available resources.

        "content": "You may have heard about a possible connection between COVID and a rare but serious health condition in children called    multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children  (MIS-C). Children with MIS-C usually develop the condition 2 to 6 weeks after being infected with COVID. MIS-C can make children very ill. Thankfully, most children who have been diagnosed with MIS-C have recovered after getting medical care. In 2023, there were at least 117    children with MIS-C  . More than half of them did not have an underlying medical condition. Most of the children never received a COVID vaccine or had received their last dose at least 12 months before they were diagnosed with MIS-C. Staying up to date with COVID vaccines protects against complications from COVID, including MIS-C. Read on to learn more about symptoms and treatment of MIS-C. Symptoms of MIS-C Children with MIS-C are very ill with a fever for 24 hours or more, have inflammation in their bodies and problems with many organs (multisystem), such as the intestines, heart, lungs, skin and blood. While different, MIS-C has some of the same symptoms as other rare childhood conditions such as    Kawasaki disease  and    toxic shock syndrome .\t Contact your child's pediatrician right away   if you are concerned that your child is showing symptoms of MIS-C, including ongoing fever plus more than one of the following: stomach pain bloodshot eyes diarrhea dizziness or lightheadedness that are signs of low blood pressure skin rash vomiting Your pediatrician can let you know if your child can be seen in the office. Seek immediate emergency medical care if your child has any of the following: Trouble breathing or shortness of breath\t Pain  or pressure in the chest that doesn't go away Starts to become confused Unable to wake up or stay awake Pale, gray or bluish-colored skin, lips or nail beds, depending on skin tone\t Be sure to let your pediatrician or emergency care providers know that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have recently had COVID. How is MIS-C diagnosed? There are a few different tests doctors may use to help diagnose MIS-C, including: Blood tests Chest x-ray Echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) Abdominal ultrasound Since MIS-C symptoms are similar to many other conditions, your doctor may also check for possible sources of illness such as: Bacterial or viral infection\t Kawasaki disease Treatment for MIS-C If your child is diagnosed with MIS-C, depending on your child's symptoms and test results,    treatment  may include: Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), a \"biologic\" medicine that contains immune system antibodies Steroids to help treat swelling or inflammation Heart medicines or low-dose aspirin Fluids given through a vein Children who become ill with MIS-C need to be treated    in the hospital , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some will need to receive care in the pediatric intensive care unit. Follow-up care If your child is hospitalized with MIS-C, the hospital team may arrange several follow-up appointments after your child has gone home. Children with MIS-C likely will need to see a    pediatric cardiologist  one to two weeks after leaving the hospital. MIS-C can cause the wall of the heart to be inflamed (myocarditis). Patients with myocarditis will be restricted from activities like exercise or    sports  for a period of time. Children treated with steroids or a biologic medicine may also need to follow up with a    pediatric rheumatologist . If a child had MIS-C, do they need a COVID-19 vaccine? Yes, all children who are eligible should receive the recommended dose or doses of    COVID vaccine . COVID vaccine should be delayed for at least 90 days after MIS-C was diagnosed and the doctor has made sure that your child is fully recovered. Prevention The best way to prevent MIS-C is for all    eligible children  age 6 months and up to get the updated COVID vaccine. Keep taking steps to help avoid exposure to COVID and other respiratory viruses. For example, remember to:\t Wash hands  often using soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based    hand sanitizer . Keep your child home and    away from others  when they are sick.  Wear    face masks  indoors in public when you or someone in your home were recently exposed to a respiratory virus, are sick or are recovering. \t Clean and disinfect  \"high touch\" surfaces. Remember While MIS-C sounds frightening, it is very rare. If your child has not received recommended immunizations, including the updated COVID vaccine, be sure to schedule their next    well-child visit .

        "content": "​​​By: Lisa M. Costello, MD, MPH, FAAP A question I commonly get from patients and friends is this: Should I get a COVID vaccine if I'm pregnant or want to become pregnant? I asked myself that same question, and the answer is yes. My husband and I got our COVID-19 shots a few months before I got pregnant, and I got another COVID-19 shot during my pregnancy. I am one of the hundreds of thousands of pregnant people living in the U.S. who got vaccinated around pregnancy, and I had a beautiful baby girl in February 2022. It's natural to pause to think about a decision that affects not only yourself but also another person. I decided to get a COVID-19 booster shot when I became eligible during my second trimester. I knew that it would be beneficial to my health and the health of my newborn.  If you have questions or want to learn more about COVID-19 vaccination and pregnancy, I suggest you talk with your pediatrician or obstetrician. You'll feel better knowing that you are making an informed decision. Meanwhile, here are some answers to questions I'm frequently asked. If I get a COVID vaccine during pregnancy, does it also protect my baby too? Yes. Immunization during pregnancy allows your body to create antibodies that can be passed along to protect your baby.  Recent    data  show that immunization during pregnancy helped prevent COVID hospitalization in infants less than 6 months old, and especially those under 3 months old. The study included infants from 26 pediatric hospitals across 20 states. Infants are recommended to start receiving COVID-19 vaccination themselves at age 6 months. Until then, immunization when you're pregnant helps your immune system and your baby's immune system.  We also now know that getting sick with COVID while pregnant can increase the risk of miscarriage or stillbirth. Vaccination helps protect you and your baby from the most serious outcomes of COVID illness.  What if I am on the fence and am thinking about waiting? Waiting to get the COVID vaccine is risky. COVID-19 immunization is effective and helps prevent serious illness or hospitalization from COVID. Vaccination also helps decrease risk of long COVID (symptoms and conditions that can last weeks, months, or years after getting COVID).  If you get COVID while you are pregnant, you can become seriously ill. Getting sick with COVID can lead to a    higher risk  for miscarriage, pre-term birth, stillbirth and death. More than    29,000 pregnant people  have been hospitalized with COVID and hundreds have died, according to the    CDC . The benefits of the vaccine during pregnancy continue when you become new parents. I have seen some of the families I care for become so sick from COVID that they are unable to be with or care for their newborn. It is devastating. I encourage anyone who is on the fence to talk to their pediatrician or other medical experts. Have vaccines been studied in pregnant people? COVID-19    vaccination during pregnancy  has been studied for years. Doctors and scientists have been monitoring pregnant people who received the vaccine, and more information confirming its benefits arrives all the time. COVID-19 vaccine    safety  has been monitored in tens of thousands of pregnant people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration and other advisory groups continue to monitor safety.  The    Vaccine Safety Datalink , the CDC and several health care organizations across the U.S. monitor and evaluate the safety of vaccines among pregnant people who choose to get vaccinated. What about vaccines and fertility? Thousands of people who have received COVID immunizations have gone on to get pregnant. A    study  of more than 2,000 females aged 21-45 years and their partners found that immunization of either partner did not affect the likelihood of becoming pregnant. And studies in men who were immunized show that sperm does not change afterwards. Can I breastfeed after getting a COVID vaccine? Yes. You can safely breastfeed after the vaccine. We are learning that    protective antibodies  can pass to the baby through breastmilk. I was comforted knowing that I passed along some immunity to my daughter through breastfeeding. This is one way I protected her until she became old enough to be immunized against COVID herself. If you received a COVID vaccine while pregnant or breastfeeding, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the COVID vaccine for your baby when they turn 6 months old. That's because the immunity you passed to your baby from the vaccine wears off over time. Also, COVID shots are periodically updated to incorporate protection from newer strains of the virus. My husband and I got the 2023-2024 updated COVID-19 shot, and we chose it to update protection for our now nearly 2-year-old daughter as well.  Remember Many pediatrician offices offer or will soon offer 2023-2024 updated COVID vaccines for babies, kids and teens. Contact your pediatrician's office to find out the best time to schedule your child's appointment. To find COVID vaccines for adults, visit    vaccines.gov .  COVID-19 vaccination is transitioning toward more traditional pathways for getting and paying for health care. Look to find a location that carries the type of COVID vaccine you are eligible for and that accepts your health insurance/coverage. There are programs to assist those who are uninsured and underinsured. Most people still should not have to pay for the vaccine. Learn more    here .  If you have other questions about receiving the COVID vaccine while pregnant, talk to your obstetrician or pediatrician. Having a conversation with a health care professional you trust can help you make the best c​hoice.

        "content": "​Your child has a stuffy nose, cough and fever. Is it the flu? COVID? Or are they symptoms of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)?  Let's look at four common childhood illnesses caused by viruses— COVID ,    flu , the    common cold  and    respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) . All of them share some similar symptoms. Here are some clues to help tell them apart. \t RSV symptoms  may include fever, cough, fatigue, stuffy nose, shortness of breath, sneezing, fast/short breaths, flaring nostrils, wheezing and grunting, poor feeding/no appetite. You may also notice their head bobbing or chest caving in between and under their ribs with each breath. Symptoms are usually the worst on days 3 through 5 and last about 7 to 14 days.\t Watch this video for signs of RSV:\t   Flu symptoms  may include fever, chills, headache, body aches, dry cough, fatigue, stuffy nose and sore throat. Some children may throw up and have diarrhea. Symptoms show up about 1 to 4 days after being exposed to a sick person. \t COVID symptoms  may include fever, cough, fatigue, muscle or body aches, congestion, shortness of breath, sore throat, headache, sneezing, vomiting/diarrhea, or loss of taste/smell. Symptoms show up    2 to 14 days  after infection.\t Cold symptoms  may include fever, cough, fatigue, stuffy nose, sore throat, sneezing, slightly swollen glands. Colds are upper respiratory infections that can be caused by many viruses. Healthy children get about 6-10 colds a year.\t Call your pediatrician if your child has any of the following symptoms: Rapid breathing, flaring nostrils, wheezing and grunting Chest caving in with each breath Shortness of breath/difficulty breathing Vomiting for more than 24 hours  Bloody diarrhea Very ill or drowsy Poor feeding Dehydration  Fever above 104 °F in any child; fever above 100.4 °F in a child under 2 months old; fever above 103 °F for more than 24 hours. Is it possible to be infected by two viruses at once? Yes. For example, children can be infected by the flu and COVID    at the same time . And it is not unusual for children to develop a secondary illness. For example, they may have    bronchiolitis  or    pneumonia  and other health problems like an ear infection or sinus infection. Some of the symptoms of flu, COVID and other respiratory illnesses are similar. Your child's pediatrician may order a    test  if it is necessary to confirm a diagnosis. How to avoid getting sick when these viruses are spreading Immunizations are an effective tool to prevent serious illness from numerous preventable diseases. Staying up to date on routine immunizations also helps others—including people at high risk if they get infected. \t Flu vaccines  are recommended for everyone 6 months and older each year. Get your child vaccinated as soon as the vaccine is available so they are protected throughout flu season, which can last until the end of May.  The updated COVID vaccine is recommended for everyone    6 months and older . Ask your pediatrician when your child should receive an updated COVID vaccine. Nirsevimab is an    RSV immunization  recommended for babies younger than 8 months of age in their first RSV season and some children age 8 to 19 months who are entering their second RSV season and are at high risk of getting very    sick from RSV . RSVpreF is a vaccine for pregnant people​  to protect their infants from RSV. Remind your child about other ways to avoid illness. Children should learn to cover their mouths and noses with a tissue when they cough or sneeze (and then put the tissue in the trash right away). They can wear a    mask in public  to avoid the spread of germs to and from others. Everyone should be encouraged to wash their hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Remember If your child is sick and you have any questions or concerns about their symptoms, don't hesitate to call your pediatrician. And, it is important for all children to stay up to date on immunizations, sports physical examinations and    routine care .

        "content": "Since    COVID vaccines  were recommended for everyone age 6 months and up,    millions of children and teens  have been safely vaccinated. To keep as many babies and kids protected as possible, it is important to make sure your family has received recommended doses of the    updated COVID vaccine . Whether you're the parent of a baby, young child or adolescent, you likely have questions about the vaccine. Here are answers to some common questions about the science behind the COVID vaccine. How does the COVID vaccine work? The COVID vaccine works similarly to other vaccines your child has had. Germs such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, invade and multiply inside the body. The vaccine prepares your child's immune system to recognize and make antibodies that fight the virus.  When your child is vaccinated, they are better protected. If they do get infected, they likely will not be as sick as they would without the vaccine. They also are much less likely to be hospitalized if they get the virus.  (See the video, \"How Your Child's Immune System Updates After Vaccinations,\" below.)\t \t  How are mRNA and protein subunit COVID vaccines different? There are two    types of vaccines  in the United States: messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines (Pfizer & Moderna) for people age 6 months and older and a protein subunit vaccine (Novavax) for people age 12 years and older who are unable to receive the mRNA vaccine. \t COVID mRNA vaccines  contain messenger RNA ( mRNA ), which is made up of nucleic acids. Nucleic acids, found naturally in all our cells, instructs them to make protein. The mRNA from the vaccine carries instructions, delivered inside a lipid (fat) coating, tells cells to produce harmless pieces of \"spike\" protein. These look like spikes on the actual COVID virus. When the cells make these pieces of spike protein, the immune system recognizes that they should not be there. Your child's body then makes antibodies that get rid of the spike pieces. These antibodies remember how to protect your child from the virus in the future.\t Did you know?  \t Even though widespread use of mRNA vaccines is new, this technology has been studied for decades. mRNA vaccines do not contain any live or dead parts of the virus.   \t The COVID subunit vaccine  includes a part (protein) of the virus that best stimulates your immune system. Once your immune system recognizes the protein, it creates antibodies and defensive white blood cells. Later, if you become infected with the COVID virus, the antibodies will fight the virus. These vaccines often include an ingredient called an adjuvant that helps to increase the body’s immune response.\t Do mRNA vaccines change your DNA?  No, the COVID vaccines made with messenger RNA do not interact with your DNA at all. DNA is your genetic material, and it is stored in the nucleus of a cell. The mRNA in the vaccines never gets into the nucleus. And once your immune cells have used the instructions, they break down the mRNA and it quickly exits the body. Can children with immune conditions get additional doses? Yes. Additional doses are    recommended  for some children and teens who have medical conditions or take medicines that weaken the immune system.  How do we know COVID vaccines are safe for kids? Millions of kids have safely received COVID vaccines.  The vaccines continue to be    monitored very closely . In fact, the   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that COVID-19 vaccines have \"the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.\" More information\t When Can Kids Get the Updated COVID Vaccine?

        "content": "By: Gary Kirkilas, DO, FAAP Working as a pediatrician in the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, I got used to building barriers against the virus. Each day, I put on my full armor of gowns, gloves, and masks. I also worked to educate families on how to also help protect and arm themselves and their children from COVID. A solid two years into the pandemic, I shared with so many others the optimism that we were on our way to beating COVID. Then my barrier suddenly came tumbling down when all four of my children caught COVID in September of 2021. This illness seemed different My eldest son, who is 7, started off by having some fatigue, chills, and a fever. He had been sick several times during these past two years. Each time, I fearfully got him tested for COVID. Fortunately, the tests always returned a negative result. But this illness seemed a little different. We noticed that he could barely stay awake. He'd often stop playing to fall asleep on the couch in the middle of the day. With growing concern, I had him tested again. Yet, I held out hope that this was just another common viral bug like the others. When his results came back, my mouth dropped. He was positive for COVID-19. I naively believed my own household would somehow be immune because of my experience dealing with the virus. It was a surreal and defeating moment to have the disease in my own home. Running our very own little COVID unit Not surprisingly, it only took a few days for the virus to spread rapidly through our home. My 4-year-old daughter, 2-year-old son, and 2-month-old baby all starting to have similar symptoms. They also tested positive. It was like me and my wife, also a pediatrician, were instantly running our very own little COVID unit in our home.\t \" I  cannot imagine \t taking care of four sick children if my wife and I were also seriously ill, needed to be hospitalized, or worse. I feel deeply for all the families who have lost a loved one to COVID, especially those who lost a parent. Parents, I cannot stress enough how important it is to get yourself vaccinated.... And if you haven't decided to vaccinate your children, please make an appointment to talk with your pediatrician. Have an honest conversation about your concerns.\"\t We were especially worried about our 2-month-old baby. We well aware that in​fants were more vulnerable and more likely to require hospitalization from COVID. Over the next few days, our baby started to become more fatigued and could barely even stay awake to breastfeed. We had to take our pediatrician hats off and take him in to be checked out by his primary care provider. Thankfully, the doctor assured us that his oxygen levels were still at a safe level. Still, it felt like that week was just a waiting game. Would our children be one of the very unfortunate ones who ended up  in the hospital , or worse, be among those who don't recover? As a pediatrician, I'm used to having some degree of separation from illness in children. But as a parent, I unfortunately had a front row seat this time. Being there for our children Because our children were so young, it was nearly impossible to have them isolate themselves. Needless to say, it was an orchestra of coughs right in front of our faces. I figured that surely my wife and I would also succumb to COVID. However, because we were both vaccinated, we never contracted COVID during the entire course of our children's illness. I cannot imagine taking care of four sick children if my wife and I were also seriously ill, needed to be hospitalized, or worse. I feel deeply for all those families out there who have lost a loved one to COVID, especially those who lost a parent. Parents, I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to get yourself vaccinated. It is one of the best decisions for your kids you can make. And if you haven't made the decision to vaccinate your children, please make an appointment to talk with your pediatrician. Have an honest conversation about your concerns. We were incredibly lucky that our children all recovered well from this illness. Since then we made it a point to have all four of our  children vaccinated against COVID  as soon as they were eligible. As I tucked the kids in each night that awful week they were sick, I knew that I had vaccines to thank for helping me be there for them.

        "content": "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, students had their world turned upside down. Schools closed their doors as the virus spread quickly through communities. Since then, we have learned a lot. One of the biggest lessons: students learn best in-person, and many are also exposed to vital relationships, resources, and other experiences they need to thrive at school. \t This school year, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is urging families to make    attendance  a priority for their child. A recent federal study found that for all students, reading and math scores are lower this year than they were in 2020. Scores were worst among students who were struggling before COVID. Daily attendance can make a big impact on long-term success and good health. Read on for ways to keep your child or teen healthy and in school. Vaccines & boosters    The AAP recommends COVID vaccination for everyone 6 months of age and older. Kids who are fully vaccinated are at a much lower risk of missing school due to being ill with COVID-19. Fully vaccinated kids don’t have to spend more time away from learning, friendships, sports and other activities. Remember that fully vaccinated people can still become infected and spread the virus to others, but less than if they were not vaccinated. If your child or teen has recovered from COVID illness, they should still get the vaccine to reduce the risk of getting sick again.    Your child or teen should be up-to-date on all recommended vaccines, including flu, HPV, meningococcal, measles and other vaccines.    Routine childhood and adolescent immunizations  can be given with COVID-19 vaccines or in the days before and after. Getting caught up will avoid outbreaks of other illnesses that could keep your kids home from school. See    Back to School: How to Help Your Child Have a Healthy Year  for more information.    Masks, testing & staying home when sick\t Masks are still a good idea.  Although not required in many school districts, indoor masking is still beneficial. Masks help stop the spread of COVID—and other infections like the common cold or    the flu . It is especially important to use well-fitting masks if your child is ineligible for the vaccine for medical reasons; immunocompromised; if a family member is at high risk; or there is a    high rate of COVID  in your community. Masks can help protect kids with immune compromise or disabilities from getting COVID, so they won’t have to miss school.    Most children with medical conditions can wear face masks with practice, support and role-modeling by adults. Ask your pediatrician if: \t you need help choosing a mask  or personal protective equipment that offers the best fit and comfort based on a child’s medical or developmental needs or\t you have concerns that a    mask cannot be worn  and want to explore all options. \t Planning for outbreaks.  Right now, COVID variants and other viruses are circulating. Schools need to plan for outbreaks that may occur. People who have symptoms or are at high risk should be tested, following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention    (CDC) guidelines . And if you get a negative result on an at-home COVID-19 antigen test, the Food and Drug Administration    advises  repeat testing. This is because tests can sometimes show false-negative results.    COVID symptoms & what to do: ✅ If a child has    COVID symptoms at school , they should be picked up right away so they can isolate. ✅ Keep your child home from school when they have symptoms so that others are not    exposed . ✅ Follow the    CDC isolation and precautions  for details on when to get tested, how long to wear a mask and when to end isolation. ✅ If your child had COVID within the past 90 days, follow the specific testing    recommendations from the CDC . School-based support for students Many families will be recovering from the impacts of the pandemic for years to come. Here are some of the supports that families can access through school. Resources for families affected by housing or food insecurity Access to high-speed internet and devices to complete schoolwork   Support, testing and necessary accommodations for students with an    Individualized Education Program (IEP)  or chronic, high-risk    medical conditions Emotional and behavioral support and resources for students with    anxiety , distress,    suicidal  thoughts and other needs If your child needs support, do not hesitate to talk with your pediatrician and school staff (including school nurses). They are there to help you explore options and connect your family with support and resources.

        "content": "By: Temitope Awelewa, MBCHB, MPH, FAAP, IBCLC\t Breastfeeding  can offer many perks, including protection from COVID-19. You can even breastfeed if you test positive for COVID, as long as you take extra safety precautions to protect your baby. Benefits of breastfeeding\t Breastfeeding is good for babies.  It            protects  them from many infections. It is not proven that breastmilk protects babies from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID. However, several studies have found antibodies that target the virus in human milk. In addition, breastfed infants are generally less likely to have severe respiratory symptoms when they get sick. \t Breastfeeding is good for you.  Hormones released in the body during breastfeeding promote wellness and can relieve            stress  and anxiety. \t Breast milk is readily available.  No purchase necessary!  Can I get vaccinated while breastfeeding?  COVID vaccines are considered safe for breastfeeding people and babies. Many lactating people have received the COVID vaccine. Recent studies demonstrated COVID-19 mRNA vaccine antibodies in the breast milk of vaccinated people, which can potentially pass along protection to the breastfed infant. More studies are needed to determine how these antibodies protect the baby.     \t When do I need to take special precautions while breastfeeding my baby? SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19 disease) spreads during close contact between people when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. People without symptoms of or confirmed COVID, who have not been in close contact with someone with COVID, do not need to take special precautions. If you have symptoms of COVID or recently had close contact with someone who had the illness, you can continue to breastfeed. Consider washing your hands with soap and water before holding the baby and wear a face mask while nursing. So far infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus has not been found in breast milk. Breastfeeding has been shown to be safe when a breastfeeding parent has other viral illnesses like      influenza . ​How can I keep my baby safe while breastfeeding if I have COVID-19? Yes, babies can still receive breast milk even if you test positive for COVID-19. The breast milk is safe and important for the baby. \t Direct breastfeeding. \t Wash your hands  with soap and water before holding the baby and wear a            face mask  while nursing. Holding your baby            skin-to-skin  helps the baby latch on and helps trigger milk release. \t Pumping breast milk.  Put on a face mask, wash your hands well, and clean any pump parts, bottles, and artificial nipples. Express milk as often as your baby eats, or at least 6 to 8 times per 24 hours. The expressed milk can be fed to your baby by a healthy caregiver. Remind all caregivers to wash their hands well before touching bottles, feeding or caring for your baby. Remember to clean your breast pump after each use, following            CDC guidelines .  If I have COVID, can I stay in the same room with my infant? If you and your family decide to keep your baby in the same room as you, try to keep a reasonable distance away when possible. Wear a face mask and wash your hands whenever you directly care for your baby.      Continue taking these prec​autions until you have been fever-free for 24 hours without taking any fever medicines (acetaminophen or ibuprofen); at least 10 days have passed since your COVID symptoms first started; and all your symptoms have improved. If you tested positive but have no symptoms, wait until at least 10 days after the positive test result. If you have two negative      antigen tests  48 hours apart, you can remove your mask sooner than 10 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. How can I maintain my milk supply if I have COVID? Hand pumping and hand      expressing  breast milk is especially helpful in the first few days after your baby is born to      get the milk supply going . Frequent pumping (or breastfeeding if you have chosen to directly breastfeed and are following precautions noted above) should line up with your infant's feeding demands, about 8-10 times in a 24-hour period.  Most      medications  are safe to take while breastfeeding, but always check with your doctor.  Ask your pediatrician for help with getting your baby to      latch on  again once you can restart breastfeeding. Do not hesitate to ask for help if you have trouble with feeding, nipple pain, low milk supply, or with any other concerns.\t Your pediatrician is here to help After leaving the hospital, it is important that your baby's      first follow-up visit  happens within 1-2 days in person so your baby can be examined, measured, and weighed. Your pediatrician also can help if you need more breastfeeding support, a lactation consultant or help from local groups and resources.

Millions of kids      in the U.S.  have received COVID-19 vaccines.     \t    Why I started a volunteer group to help people access the COVID vaccine\t By Benjamin Kagan\t \t  I'm 15 years old and a youth vaccine advocate. For those who are old enough but still have not been vaccinated, I am sharing my story with you about why I made the choice to get the COVID vaccine—and I urge you to get it, too.                    \t I also encourage everyone who is eligible to get their booster shot to do so right away. \t My journey with the COVID-19 vaccine started when I was watching TV and saw that Florida, where my grandparents live, was opening up vaccination appointments to seniors and health care workers for the first time. \t My grandparents (pictured above with me) had been living their lives with extreme caution since the pandemic began. They had been refraining from in-person interactions with friends and family. They hadn't seen me or any of their grandkids for many months because we don't live in the same state. They were eager to get COVID vaccines but finding and setting up appointments wasn't easy for them. I wanted to keep them safe, so I vowed to work tirelessly to find them vaccine appointments.\t The experience inspired me to start Chicago Vaccine Angels—a group of 50+ volunteers working to get vaccine appointments for health care workers, senior citizens, and essential workers. \t My grandparents weren't the only reason I made the choice to get vaccinated. Before the vaccine became available to teens, I was living in constant fear. I was really scared that I might get                     long-haul COVID  and suffer side effects for many years. As a result of my concerns, I rarely saw friends and was extremely careful on the occasions that I did. \t When it was my turn to get the COVID-19 vaccine, I was extremely excited. \t Don't get me wrong—like every other kid, I don't enjoy getting shots. But this shot was different. This shot allowed me to feel safe in school, hang out with friends and get back to a somewhat normal life. \t Again, I'm a teenager and I understand that life hasn't returned to what it was before the pandemic. It has become substantially better now that I'm vaccinated. Today, I can play soccer again and not worry about whether I'm going to be the next person to become seriously ill with COVID-19. Getting vaccinated also allowed me to see my grandparents and extended family. \t   In my opinion, getting vaccinated is a selfless decision. By getting vaccinated, you are helping to protect not only yourself, but also the older and high-risk people with whom you have frequent contact.\t For the United States to return to normalcy, all of us need to get vaccinated so that we can get this dangerous virus under control. So please, do your part and get the shot.                    \t   Benjamin Kagan attends high school in Chicago. Founder of the Chicago Vaccine Angels, he is an administrator of the Chicago Vaccine Hunters and a Vaccine Ambassador for the \t   State of Illinois  and the \t   City of Chicago . \t \t      We can protect one another The vaccine does more than prevent serious illness in healthy kids. When everyone is vaccinated, they are less likely to get very sick and      need hospital care .  The highly contagious virus can be passed to a young child, then to a grandparent, who may be at higher risk of serious illness or death from a COVID-19 infection.  We can stay healthy Many people think that side effects from a vaccine are not supposed to happen. In fact, side effects are expected. Vaccine-anticipated reactions are a good sign that the body is reacting to the vaccine and that it is working to develop immunity to the virus.  Children and teens are more at risk of      serious side effects  ​from the virus  than from the vaccine. And we know that kids who get COVID can have      long-COVID  illness and other ongoing problems.  Trust your pediatrician The vaccines are safe, and they are the best public health measure to protect people from COVID-19, slow transmission, and reduce the likelihood of new variants emerging. Your pediatrician can answer all your questions about the vaccine and the virus that causes COVID.

        "content": "By: Dennis Z. Kuo, MD, MHS, FAAP & Cara Coleman, JD, MPH  Kids with special health care needs should not get left behind in school as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. In fact, even more children and teens may now require extra support due to long-term effects caused by COVID infections.  Children and youth with special health care needs have or are at increased risk for chronic physical, developmental, behavioral or emotional conditions, disabilities and medically complex conditions. They require health and other services beyond the needs of children generally. Now, as communities relax steps such as masking to protect against COVID, you may wonder how best to keep your child or teen with special health care needs safe in school or child care. Here's what to know as families and children with special health care needs make up for lost time from delays, cancellations and changes to daily routines and support systems.  Keep using layers of protection & creative, flexible ways to safely meet needs When the  community level  of COVID is medium or high, more layers of protection should be used, including: Stay up to date on COVID vaccines and boosters.  This includes getting all primary series doses of the vaccine and an updated booster dose. Individuals with certain  medical conditions  may need additional doses. Everyone eligible should get the vaccine and booster: family members, household contacts, health care workers and education workers who have contact with kids with  special health care needs .  Catch up on recommended immunizations.  Children and youth with special health care needs also need to stay up to date on all  recommended  vaccines. The  flu  shot for everyone age 6 months and older is particularly important during the pandemic to protect kids who are at an increased risk for influenza complications. It is important to recognize the need to stop the spread of all respiratory illnesses. Use face masks in areas with medium and high community levels and any time spread is more likely—when in close contact, closed spaces, crowded locations and when individuals are unvaccinated.  Masks help reduce the risk of infection from the virus. Families and caregivers may consider using face masks, as well. There are very few medical conditions that would prevent children age 2 years and older from wearing face masks. Keep in mind: The best protection is given by  well-fitting N95/K95/KF94 masks , followed by well-fitting surgical/procedure masks. Getting good coverage from a face mask may take extra attention for a child or teen who has a  craniofacial  condition. Find tips  here  to help your child get used to wearing a face mask, and how to get it to fit correctly. Consider using  social stories  or a make a wearing schedule to ease your child into wearing a mask. For children who rely on lip reading, people in close contact can use face masks with transparent windows. Other ways to communicate, such as voice-to-text mobile apps may also be helpful. If your child has a behavioral therapist or occupational therapist, consider asking them to make mask wearing a part of your child's therapeutic goals. Keep hands & surfaces clean.  Wash hands and keep surfaces, shared spaces and shared objects clean. This helps prevent all diseases that are spread through direct surface contact. Ask if surface cleaning, handwashing, and hand sanitizers are part of the process of what supplies will be available (either from the school or brought by the student). Consider telehealth for clinic & therapy appointments Talk to your pediatrician and specialists to plan which visits can be done virtually and which need to be in person. Verify that each visit is covered by insurance. Virtual visits.  Your pediatrician, specialists, therapists, and others who care for your child may offer  telehealth  appointments by phone, Skype, FaceTime, or another telehealth option. Home-based lab draws and diagnostic imaging tests may also be available. There are  tools  to help children and caregivers who need hearing or vision help participate in virtual visits In-person appointments.  Schedule care planning and health visits and use telehealth when needed. Plan for optimal timing of in-person visits, including vaccinations, such as early appointment times. Ensure safe transportation options for in-person appointments, especially those who rely on public transit. Creative, flexible and responsive accommodations can help meet your child's needs for in-person visits. Health care personnel should honor requests made by families to wear a face mask, even when it is not required. Keep in-person instruction the priority for kids with special health care needs Disruptions to in-person school affect learning for children with special health care needs. In-person school should be the priority—including and especially for children with special health care needs. Work with your pediatrician and school to create plans that ensure your child's safety and does not single them out. Your pediatrician can help explain how schools and child care can continue using multiple layers of protection, keep track of community levels, masking, ventilation, and other supports to keep all kids learning in person.  Include strategies in their Individualized Education Program ( IEP ) or 504 plan.  For example, masking and air filtration can be requested to protect children and teens with special health care needs—even if the rest of the school has relaxed standards.  Annual IEP updates are required for children who are learning in virtual, hybrid and in-person formats. IEP plans and goals can and should be adjusted as needed. This includes any needs for compensatory education and services—even if this occurs more than once a year—especially since many evaluations and services were disrupted over the past few years. Families can get support about education issues, including IEPs and 504 Plans here:  Parent training and information centers Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)   Remember Not every child or adult will react in the same way to the stress of the pandemic, but it is likely that everyone is reacting in some way. These emotions and reactions affect children with  cognitive disabilities , as well. Talk to your pediatrician about any concerns, signs or symptoms related to  mental health . Families, parents, and caregivers who take care of children with special health care needs are strong and  resilient . But to continue taking care of your family, you must make sure that you engage in self-care activities by taking  time for yourself, too .

        "content": "By:  Franziska Rosser MD, MPH, FAAP & S ylvia Owusu-Ansah MD, MPH, FAAP  If your child has asthma, you may worry whether they are at greater risk from    respiratory viruses  such as COVID-19, influenza (flu) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Here are some common questions and ways to help keep children with asthma healthy while respiratory viruses are spreading.  Does having asthma put my child at higher risk of getting sick from COVID-19, the flu or RSV? People with    moderate-to-severe or uncontrolled asthma  may be more likely to be hospitalized from  COVID-19 . Having asthma also raises the risk of    complications from flu , and flu can trigger asthma attacks. Similarly,  RSV  can worsen asthma symptoms. And there is evidence that children who had RSV may be at higher risk of developing asthma.  How important is it that my child's asthma is well-controlled with respiratory viruses going around? It is always important to have well controlled asthma. With respiratory viruses like flu, RSV and COVID-19 surging, this is especially important. We want to prevent children from needing emergency department care when possible.  Having uncontrolled asthma is a risk factor for asthma attacks, so control is the goal. However, if your child is having an asthma emergency, don't delay seeking immediate medical care.  How do I know if my child's asthma is well-controlled? If you're not sure your child's asthma is well controlled, the first step would be to call your pediatrician or other asthma care provider. Well controlled asthma usually means your child is: coughing on no more than 2 days per week waking up at night from coughing no more than once per month (or no more than 2 nighttime awakenings for children 12 years and older) needing 2 or less rescue treatments per week (this does not include pre-treating before exercise) having no more than 1 course of oral steroids such as prednisone in the last 12 months able to fully participate in regular activity without breathing limitations  This would be a good time to review your child's asthma control and management plan with the doctor. Your pediatrician and other asthma providers want to know about your child's asthma concerns, so don't be shy about contacting them! What if my child has an asthma attack during respiratory illness surges? For children with asthma, we recommend that parents, other caregivers and school or child care have an    asthma action plan . Your child's asthma action plan will tell you what to do every day for asthma care, as well as what to do if your child has asthma symptoms. It is important to manage asthma attacks the same way as usual during outbreaks. Don't worry about using oral steroids, for example, if that is part of your child's action plan.  Make sure you talk with your pediatrician if you have any questions or concerns about your child's asthma medicine or action plan.  When should I seek emergency care for my child with asthma?\t Go to the emergency department immediately or call 911  if your child is having symptoms that include: can't catch their breath, speak in full sentences (if developmentally appropriate), or walk or run because of breathing difficulties movement of the muscles in between the ribs, abdomen (sometimes called    belly breathing ) and/or in the neck making grunting noises, head bobbing, not responding to albuterol treatments older child complains of chest pain or chest tightness while having trouble breathing feeling drowsy or confused  turning a bluish or grayish color around their mouth, middle of the face, or chest Your child's asthma action plan can provide more details about when to seek immediate or emergency care. \t Some children may not require emergency care, but need a change in treatment plan or closer monitoring. Call your pediatrician or asthma care provider  if your child is having any of these symptoms: increased coughing; chest pain, back pain decreased ability to do usual activities symptoms not responding to albuterol (but otherwise not in distress) needing albuterol treatments more frequently than every 4 hours (but otherwise not in distress) not getting better after 2-3 days of increasing albuterol What is the best form of albuterol to give—an inhaler or nebulizer treatment? Studies have shown that albuterol given through a nebulizer or metered-dose inhaler, when taken appropriately, are equally effective. There is some evidence that albuterol inhalers, when used with spacers, are more effective than albuterol through a nebulizer. Whether you have an inhaler or nebulizer, it is important to make sure you are using the medications correctly.  Using a spacer or spacer/mask with an albuterol inhaler helps more medicine get into the airways , for example. For most metered-dose inhalers, we don't recommend using it without a spacer or spacer/mask. Once children are able to take a deep slow breath in through their mouth and hold it for 10 seconds, we recommend using a spacer. Most children are able to switch from a spacer/mask to a spacer around 5 or 6 years of age.\t When using a nebulizer , children should use a face mask until they are at least 5-6 years old.  They can use a mouthpiece once they are able to breath in through their mouth. Blow-by albuterol, or rather holding the nebulizer tube near the face, delivers very little albuterol to airways and is not recommended.  One thing to keep in mind: Using a nebulizer for albuterol treatments may increase the amount of virus in the air if the person has a respiratory virus like COVID-19. This could potentially spread the virus to others more easily, since the virus may stay in air droplets for up to several hours. Talk with your child's asthma care provider about which delivery method is best for them. Shortages of albuterol inhalers have previously been reported in some areas, and some insurances have not covered spacers. Best practices are probably going to be different based on location and a child's individual needs.  How can I help prevent my child from having an asthma attack during viral season? Help your child follow their asthma management plan and take their    controller medications  as prescribed. Know when to step up care and when to call your pediatrician or asthma care provider. In addition, there are other steps you can take:\t Get vaccinated.  It is especially important for children and teens with asthma to be up-to-date on immunizations. Vaccines keep the immune system primed and ready when respiratory viruses spread. Currently, there is no vaccine available for RSV. But everyone ages 6 months and up should get vaccines for COVID-19 and the flu, along with other routine immunizations. \t Use good hand hygiene & other basics.  Handwashing is a simple but powerful way to help prevent the spread of germs. Wearing a face mask and avoiding crowded spaces, especially indoors, is also an effective way to reduce exposure to respiratory viruses.\t Go smoke-free and vape-free.  People with asthma should avoid asthma triggers such as tobacco smoke, marijuana smoke or e-cigarette/vape aerosol. If a parent or caregiver    smokes or vapes , it is important to do it outside. Smoking or vaping in another room does not prevent pollution from traveling to different areas of the home. Teenagers or pre-teens themselves should not smoke or vape as this will worsen asthma symptoms and lung disease. Tobacco smoke also increases the risk of developing certain cancers. The 1-800-QUITNOW is a free nationwide number that helps people stop smoking. Many states provide free supplies such as nicotine replacement patches. \t Avoid allergy triggers.  Try to reduce exposure to known allergy    triggers , which can also aggravate asthma. For example, if a child with asthma is allergic to ragweed pollen, you might want to keep windows closed during the Fall to reduce exposure. Cleaning is important to help reduce allergens, along with respiratory virus germs, but can be tricky for parents of children with asthma. If your child is sensitive to certain cleaning products, use them when your child is not in the room, turn on a fan, open a window or try switching to less irritating products.\t Avoid indoor and outdoor air pollution:  Air pollution can irritate airways and can trigger asthma symptoms. Some sources of indoor air pollution can include using a gas stove without venting outside, burning candles or incense, tobacco smoke/e-cig aerosols, and older wood stoves. If you use a chimney or wood stove and smell smoke in the house, consider having it checked by a professional. Outdoor    air pollution  such as particle pollution and ozone can worsen asthma and cause attacks. Particle pollution is generally higher near major roadways and during rush hour. Ozone pollution is generally higher in the afternoon on warm days. If your child has asthma, you can check the Air Quality Index (AQI) on Airnow.gov or the Airnow smartphone app. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has great information about    indoor  and outdoor air quality.\t Reduce stress.  Stress can be another trigger for asthma. Take time to relax as a family and use    positive parenting  tips to help your child cope and build    resilience . Taking a walk    outside  and keeping active can help to reduce stress. \t Take care of all health needs.  People with asthma should take extra care of their overall health. In addition to getting vaccinated, avoiding tobacco smoke, reducing stress and avoiding allergy triggers and air pollution, it's important to remember the basics: using good    hand hygiene , eating nutritious food and getting enough    physical activity  and    sleep . \t Make sure you have enough asthma medicine on hand.  It's a good idea for people with asthma to make sure they have asthma medicines at home and to call for refills when the inhaler is getting close to empty. Many pharmacies will deliver medicine through the mail at no extra charge.  Remember Having an asthma action plan, knowing how to use it, and communicating with your asthma provider can give you more information and confidence to handle your child's asthma, including asthma attacks.

        "content": "​Having COVID vaccines for everyone age 6 months and up is a game changer for many families. Being fully vaccinated can keep kids healthy for fun activities like youth sports. Kids who are vaccinated and boosted mostly have not been severely ill from COVID or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). However, all children and teens who test positive for COVID should have at least one follow-up conversation or visit with their pediatrician. (See, \" Returning to physical activity after COVID ,\" below.)  Read on for strategies to protect kids starting or returning to sports and other physical activity. Before the sports season starts    Understand the safety rules for participation during COVID. Talk about what they mean with your child. Call your pediatrician to make an appointment if your child needs a pre-participation physical evaluation. It's also a good time to catch up on    recommended vaccinations . If your child has not been very    active , it's a good idea to ease into exercise. For sports with a lot of running, for example, consider a beginner running program (such as the \"Couch to 5K\" or \"None to Run\" apps) a couple months before the season. This can help prevent injuries that sudden, intense activity can cause in growing children. It can also reduce the risk of heat-related illness in kids affected by obesity.  Prior to practice or games Keep your child home from practice or games if they have any signs or    symptoms  of COVID, and consult your pediatrician for testing guidance. Anyone who is exposed to someone with COVID should follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for a    known exposure .  Remind your child to wash their hands before arriving or use hand sanitizer if soap and water aren't available. Bring labeled (with name) personal sports equipment, water bottle, towel, tissues, hand sanitizer, and face mask if use is indicated by COVID community levels. Returning to physical activity after COVID-19 infection If your child has a positive COVID-19 test, notify their pediatrician. The doctor can advise how long they need to wait before returning to exercise or sports. This will be based on how severe their COVID-19 symptoms are, and whether they develop signs of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children ( MIS-C ), myocarditis or other    post-COVID-19 conditions .\t Children and teens with no symptoms or mild symptoms of COVID-19, and no symptoms of MIS-C  need to have a phone,    telemedicine  or in-person visit with their pediatrician. The doctor will tell you how long to isolate and advise your child not to exercise during that time. They will also ask about heart symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue,    irregular heartbeat  or    fainting . A child with a positive heart screening will need to have an in-person visit for a complete physical exam. The doctor will decide if an electrocardiogram (EKG) is needed before clearing your child for physical activity.\t Those with moderate symptoms of COVID-19 and no signs of MIS-C  should have an in-person visit with their doctor. They should not exercise until their symptoms are gone and they are seen by their doctor to be screened for possible effects of COVID-19 on the heart, a complete physical exam and EKG. Moderate symptoms are considered to be 4 or more days of fever over 100.4 F, a week or more of muscle aches, chills or fatigue, or a hospital stay that wasn't in the intensive care unit (ICU). Next steps depend on the cardiac screening and/or EKG findings.\t If your child's heart screening is normal , they can gradually go back to physical activity once 10 days have passed from a positive test. Their symptoms also have to be gone without using fever-reducing medicine for at least 10 days. \t If your child's heart screening or EKG is abnormal , you will probably be referred to a cardiologist for more tests.\t Children and teens who were very sick from COVID-19 or diagnosed with \t   MIS-C  must be treated as though they have an inflamed heart muscle ( myocarditis ). Because they needed to stay in the ICU and/or were intubated, they may need other tests depending on signs and symptoms. Before your child leaves the hospital, have a plan to follow up with a cardiologist.\t After severe illness or MIS-C , exercise should be restricted for at least 3 to 6 months. A pediatric cardiologist should examine your child before they can return to exercise or competition. The doctor will recommend a schedule of gradually increasing physical activity based on your child's age and how severe the symptoms were.\t \t  Keep in mind:  Even if your child is cleared for activity, they will need to stop immediately if they experience any of these symptoms:\t   Chest pain Increased shortness of breath Sudden    heart palpitations Feeling    faint  or passing out  Your child will need to see their pediatrician in-person if they have any of these symptoms to rule out a heart issue. During sports practice or games  When there is a \"high\" COVID community level, it is strongly recommended that athletes, coaches, officials and spectators wear a face mask indoors, even if vaccinated and boosted.  This includes wearing a mask in crowded indoor spaces like locker rooms, shared transportation, walking to and from the playing area, between practice drills and on the sidelines. If your child takes off their mask during a break indoors, they should stay at least 3 feet away from everyone else. When there is a \"medium\" COVID community level, wearing a face mask indoors also is recommended if an athlete or someone on the team or within their home is immunocompromised or considered    high risk . However, masks should    not  be worn during: Water sports such as swimming, diving and water polo since wet masks may be difficult to breathe through. If a mask becomes soaked with sweat, it should be changed right away. Certain exercises in competitive cheerleading and gymnastics. The goal is to avoid the risk of masks getting caught on equipment, creating a choking hazard or blocking vision.  Face masks are also discouraged while wrestling, unless an adult coach or official is closely monitoring to ensure the masks don't become a choking hazard. Exceptions to mask-wearing may be appropriate when the risk of heat-related illness is increased. Be a good sport when individuals choose to wear a face mask. Some must wear masks when they go out so they can protect themselves or their family members. Remind one another that people who wear masks should not be targeted or bullied for their decision. To help protect everyone: Avoid huddles, high-fives, fist bumps, handshakes, etc. Do not share food or drink with teammates. Avoid cheering, chanting or singing when closer than 6-8 feet from others. Don't spit or blow your nose without a tissue. Minimize sharing sports equipment when possible. Tell a coach if you are not feeling well and leave the practice or game with a parent or caregiver. After sports practice or games Sanitize or wash hands.  Wash or replace face masks, towel, and practice clothes or uniform.  Clean personal sports equipment and water bottle. Remember Talk with your pediatrician if you have any questions about your child's sports participation and health.

        "content": "By: Kimberly M. Dickinson, MD, MPH & Theresa W. Guilbert, MD, MS, FAAP\t Face masks  are still an important tool for many families to help prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes  COVID-19 . This includes new and more contagious  variants .  Masks help protect unvaccinated and vaccinated people, and are important for individuals to use in areas where the    COVID-19 Community Level  is high. Masks can be safely worn by all children older than 2 years.  Individuals may choose to continue wearing face masks when they go out so they can protect themselves or their family members.   Some parents may have concerns about face masks, and we're here to help. Here are some common questions, along with the facts about kids and masks that will put your mind at ease:  Do masks make it harder for my child to breathe? There have been concerns that face masks can reduce oxygen intake, and can lead to low blood oxygen levels, known as hypoxemia. However, masks are made from breathable materials that will not block the oxygen your child needs. Masks have not been shown to affect a child's ability to focus or learn in school. The vast majority of children age 2 or older can safely wear face masks for extended periods of time, such as during preschool or at child care. This includes most children with special health care needs.  Can masks interfere with a child's lung development? No, wearing a face mask will not affect your child 's lungs from developing normally. This is because oxygen flows through and around the mask, while blocking the spray of spit and respiratory droplets that may contain the virus. Keeping your child's lungs healthy is important, which includes preventing infections like COVID-19.  Do masks trap the carbon dioxide that we normally breathe out? No. There have been false reports that face masks can lead to carbon dioxide poisoning (known as hypercapnia) from re-breathing the air we normally breathe out. But this is not true. Carbon dioxide molecules are very tiny, even smaller than respiratory droplets. They cannot be trapped by breathable materials like disposable masks. In fact, surgeons wear tight fitting masks all day as part of their jobs, without any harm.  Children under 2 years of age should not wear masks since they may not be able to remove them without help. Children with severe breathing problems or  cognitive impairments  may also have a hard time tolerating a face mask and extra precautions may be needed.  Can masks lead to a weaker immune system by putting the body under stress? No. Wearing a face mask does not weaken your immune system or increase your chances of getting sick if exposed to the COVID-19 virus. Wearing a mask, even if you do not have symptoms of COVID-19, helps prevent the virus from spreading.  How do masks prevent the spread of COVID-19? When worn correctly, face masks create a barrier that reduces the spray of a person's spit and respiratory droplets. These droplets play a key role in the spread of COVID-19 because they can carry SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Masks also can protect you from others who may have coronavirus but are not showing symptoms and who could come within 6 feet of you, which is how far respiratory droplets can travel when people sneeze or cough or raise their voices. In order to be effective, masks should:\t \t   \t \t  Cover both the nose and mouth\t Fit snugly but comfortably against the sides of the face\t Be secured with ear loops or ties\t Have multiple layers\t Allow for unrestricted breathing\t   Another benefit of wearing masks is that they may keep people from touching their mouths and faces, which is another way    COVID, colds, flu and RSV  and other respiratory diseases are spread.  Remember Masks are an important strategy to prevent COVID from spreading, especially as new contagious variants circulate. Masks are safe and effective for anyone age 2 years or older. Don't hesitate to talk with your child's pediatrician if you have any questions about your child wearing face masks.

        "content": "Masks remain a simple but powerful tool to help prevent the spread of    COVID-19 .  Read on for answers to some frequently asked questions about masks, children and COVID-19. Masks work even when others don't wear them A   well-fitting high quality face mask reduces the chance of contracting COVID-19, as well as spreading COVID-19 infection to others. Face masks should not be worn by children if they are under 2 years old. Face masks are strongly encouraged for:  Vaccinated and unvaccinated people age 2 years and older in areas of the country with    high transmission  of COVID-19.  Families with babies under age 6 months who are ineligible for COVID vaccination.\t People with weakened immune systems  who may not have mounted a full immune response to the vaccine and are at high risk if they get sick. People who want to protect their family members at risk. If you have a medically fragile child or an at-risk adult in your household, you may want to consider having anyone at home who is not fully vaccinated wear masks at home to help protect them. Children and youth with    special health care needs  who may be vaccinated but still are at higher risk if they get sick. Children and teens who  lack immunity  to the virus despite vaccination or prior infection. It's also recommended to wear a face mask inside your home if someone you live with is sick with      symptoms  of COVID-19 or has tested positive. Why wear masks at daycare, preschool or school?  Well-fitting    face masks  worn by everyone 2 years old and older and adults, including child care teachers, protects them as well as others. In K-12    schools ,  students, teachers, staff and visitors should be supported if they continue wearing masks. The same is true for anyone who continues wearing masks for   sports.  My child just turned 2. How do I help them get used to wearing a mask? Face masks have been around for a few years, but mask wearing is still new to a child who is turning 2. Here are a few ideas that might help make your child more comfortable when they are getting used to wearing a mask: Look in the mirror with the face mask on and talk about it. Put a mask on a favorite stuffed animal. Decorate them so they're more personalized and fun. Show your child pictures of other children wearing them. Draw one on their favorite book character. Practice wearing the face mask at home to help your child get used to it. It may be challenging for very young children not to fidget with their face mask. Expect to give your child plenty of gentle reminders not to touch their face mask. When mask-wearing is reinforced by adults and peers, they will learn to follow directions. Just like children understand that they must wear bicycle helmets and buckle into their car seats, they will learn to wear masks correctly and routinely when needed. How can I explain to my child when they still need a mask at daycare?   For children under 3 , it's best to answer their questions simply in language they understand. If they ask about why people are wearing face masks, explain that sometimes people need to wear them to stay healthy.\t For children over 3 , try focusing on germs. Explain that germs are special to your own body. Some germs and good and some are bad. The bad ones can make you sick. Since we can't always tell which are good or bad, the face masks help make sure you keep those germs away from your own body. What about kids with special health care needs? Children with weakened immune systems or who have health conditions or special health care needs that put them at high risk for infections are encouraged to wear an N95 mask for protection. Those with medical conditions that interfere with cognitive or lung function may have a hard time tolerating a face mask. For these children, special precautions may be needed. Families are encouraged to   have a plan and discuss appropriate masks and precautions with their pediatrician. What kind of face mask is best? Look for a    well-fitting comfortable face mask  that fits your child's face. The mask should fit securely under the chin but not impair vision, and cover the mouth    and  nose. It should fit snugly along the sides of the face without any gaps. Remember to wash hands before and after wearing it and avoid touching it once it's on. When back home, avoid touching the front of the face mask by taking it off from behind.\t Note:  Face masks should not be worn when eating or drinking. Also, make sure the mask has no choking or strangulation hazards for young children. Remember Along with COVID-19    vaccination  and boosters, mask wearing when recommended and other safety measures such as physical distancing, testing and hand washing are key to reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread. If you have any concerns about your child's health, talk with your pediatrician. More Information Face Masks and Other Prevention Strategies (AAP Interim Guidance)",

        "content": "by: Kathi Kemper, MD, FAAP Feeling connected to the people and world around us is a key part of good mental health. COVID-19 vaccines have revived social activities in many communities. But families with children  too young  for the vaccine may still be spending less time with others. If spirits are sagging in your home, here are some simple steps that may help lift everyone's moods. Lighten up Sunshine can help brighten mood. Try to spend 30 to 60 minutes    outdoors  daily with your children and other members of your family, whenever possible. Bright lights, especially in the early morning, can also help.  Get plenty of sleep Try to help your children stick to    bedtime  routines so they get enough    sleep  each night. Some ways to help promote relaxation and a good night's sleep: A shower or bath before bed A    story , song, or relaxing music A back, hand, or foot rub A cool, dark room Using the bed just for sleep (not using your phone, watching TV or doing work or homework) Talk it out  Talk with your children and    teens  regularly and be a good listener. Parents can also benefit from finding a friend or family member to discuss worries and disappointments. If conversation cannot be in person because of social distancing, then connect by phone, video calls, or other virtual connection. Help your family eat wisely  Include    protein-rich foods  for breakfast and lunch. Protein helps keep your blood sugar stable and gives your brain the fuel it needs. Also, if possible:  Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Sources include    fish  (salmon, sardines, mackerel, herring); plants (flaxseeds, chia seeds, dark leafy vegetables, kidney beans, pinto beans, soybeans, walnuts, tofu); and certain oils (canola, soybean, walnut). Research suggests a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids may help support mood.  Choose plenty of    vegetables , fruits, and whole grains. They contain vitamins,    fiber , and minerals your brain needs.  Limit junk food and fast food. They're often full of fat, cholesterol, salt, and    added sugars , which can cause spikes and slumps in energy that may leave us feeling irritable.  Go for gratitude  Focus on the positive. For what do you feel gratitude or appreciation? Research shows that regularly expressing  gratitude  helps boost overall happiness, leading to lower rates of stress and depression. Help your child write down at least three people, places, events, or things each day that make them feel thankful. Keep your own gratitude journal, too!  Step it up  Help your children to    exercise  or play so hard they break a sweat every day. When we exercise, our bodies release chemicals that can help boost mood. Remember to choose activities that help them stay at least 6 feet away from people outside your household. Also, try to avoid anything that involves sharing equipment such as balls, bats, and playground equipment.  Lend a hand Helping other people makes us feel better about ourselves. It can be as simple as calling a neighbor or family member who is home alone or putting up a sign thanking people who deliver the mail. Help your children come up with at least one    kind  act each day. Keep a journal of all the things you and your family do for others—even the little things.  Manage screen time  Make a    family media plan  and limit your family's exposure to TV and    internet ads  suggesting that buying things can make people happy. This will help limit messages about happiness that are false or unrealistic. It will also help you manage your family's exposure to upsetting news. Consider instead: reading, playing cards or board games with family members, working a puzzle as a family, playing music or singing together, making a video to share, cooking together or taking a family walk or bike ride.  Keep in mind: our electronic devices can also be used to create and maintain healthy social connections. You and your children may consider participating in online educational programs, virtual visits with grandparents and loved ones at higher risk from COVID-19 and participating in virtual online community events. It's also good to become familiar with telehealth options offered by your doctor and your child's pediatrician in case health questions arise.  Address stress  Try    meditating  as a family or other relaxation techniques such as    yoga  to help everyone decrease    stress  and improve mood. There are helpful mobile apps that that offer reminders take deep breaths and other tips to relax. Time in nature may help too.  What if your child's mood doesn't improve? Sometimes, steps like these aren't enough to improve your child's mood or reduce their anxiety. Be sure to contact your pediatrician if you are concerned that your child is struggling with stress or anxiety or if you are worried they might hurt themselves or someone else. Your pediatrician can also help determine if underlying health conditions or medications may be causing mood problems. They can also connect you with other health professionals such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, or social worker.

        "content": "COVID-19, discovered in December 2019, quickly became a global pandemic. Doctors and researchers continue to learn more about it every day. Now, safe and effective  vaccines  and boosters are recommended for many children and teens. While the virus continues to spread, everyone should    stay up to date  with their vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines work to protect you from getting sick. Based on what is known about COVID-19 vaccines and other recommended vaccines for kids, people who are up to date with their vaccines are well protected from getting seriously sick or having other health problems. Here's what we know now and how you can protect your family and others. Symptoms of COVID-19 Symptoms  of COVID-19, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, range from mild to severe and generally begin 2-14 days after being exposed to the virus. Someone with these symptoms may have COVID-19: fever and chills a cough shortness of breath or difficulty breathing muscle or body aches headache  fatigue new loss of taste or smell  sore throat congestion or runny nose nausea or vomiting diarrhea Which children are at highest risk? According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), unvaccinated  children  seem to be at higher risk for getting severely ill with COVID-19. Some    children with special health care needs  also may be at higher risk, including those with chronic medical conditions such as:\t Obesity Conditions that weaken the immune system Sickle cell disease Heart disease or congenital heart conditions Lung disease (including  asthma )\t Diabetes Neurodevelopmental disorders such as cerebral palsy Chronic kidney disease Complex medical conditions, including some that require breathing or feeding tubes, or home ventilators. \t If you are concerned about your child's symptoms, call your pediatrician right away. Does COVID-19 affect children the same way as adults? Many children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or have no symptoms at all, and most children with COVID-19 infection have recovered. However, some have become severely ill and have been    hospitalized , and some have died. In addition, like adults, some children and teens with COVID-19, even with few or no symptoms, have developed    post-COVID conditions  such as    long-haul  COVID. How to protect your family Here are a few things you can do to keep your family healthy: Get  COVID-19 vaccines  for all family members who are eligible. Vaccines are now recommended for adults and children ages 5 years and up. Vaccines for children under 5 years old may be authorized next. Clinical trials continue for vaccines that could be given to children as young as six months old. Get    boosted  if eligible. If it has been at least five months since their last COVID vaccine, kids 5 years and older should get a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster. Some immunocompromised children aged 5 through 11 years old should get an    additional dose  of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to complete the primary series. Avoid crowds, poorly ventilated spaces, and keep a safe  physical distance  from people outside your household.  Anyone over age 2 should wear a well-fitting    face mask  in public. Universal mask wearing is also recommended    in schools  by all students, teachers, staff, and visitors.  Follow local and state guidance on  travel  restrictions.\t Wash your hands  often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use  hand sanitizer  that is 60% or higher alcohol-based.  Teach kids to    cough and sneeze  into a tissue (make sure to throw it away after each use!) or into their arm or elbow, not their hands. Avoid touching your face; teach your children to do the same. Clean and  disinfect  your home as usual using regular household cleaning sprays or wipes. Wash stuffed animals or other plush toys, following manufacturer's instructions in the warmest water possible and dry them completely. Are there medicines to treat or prevent COVID-19 in babies, children or teens? The Food and Drug Administration has given emergency use authorization for monoclonal antibody therapies   to treat mild to moderate COVID symptoms in some adults, adolescents, children or infants. They may help block the SARS-CoV-2 virus from entering cells and make it easier for the body to destroy the virus. Only one monoclonal antibody therapy for children ( sotrovimab ) may be effective against the omicron variant. There is a very limited supply of this medicine. To be considered for sotrovimab, adolescents must be age 12 or older and weigh at least 88 pounds; have had symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a positive    COVID test  for less than 10 days; and be at high risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, but not yet hospitalized. Some children at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19 may be eligible for monoclonal antibody treatment to protect them  before they are exposed  to the virus. If your child is high risk and you are concerned about them being exposed to COVID, call your pediatrician to discuss if this is an option.    Another option that is authorized for people at high risk of severe COVID illness is oral antiviral medication ( paxlovid  and molnupiravir). One of these  antivirals  is authorized for children as young as 12 years, but it is too soon to know how well it works in children. What about home remedies?   Home remedies families may hear about on social media, such as    ivermectin , azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine are    NOT  proven effective against COVID-19 and can be toxic if used incorrectly.  How to care for someone in your family with COVID-19 People who are mildly ill with COVID-19 are usually able to    isolate  at home during their illness. However, it may be recommended to take these additional steps:\t Separate family members with COVID-19 from others as much as possible.  The person with the virus should stay in a specific room and away from other people in your home. Ideally, they should use a separate bathroom, if available. Limit visitors in the house.\t Avoid contact with \t   pets .  This includes petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food.\t Call ahead before  visiting the doctor .  This will help them take extra steps to keep other people from getting infected or exposed.\t Avoid sharing personal household items.  Don't share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people or pets in the home. After using these items, they should be washed thoroughly with soap and water.\t Extra cleaning for all \"high-touch\" surfaces.  These include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them. Use a household cleaning spray or wipes and follow the instructions on the label.\t Monitor symptoms.  Call your doctor or 911 right away if the illness gets worse. In children, the goal should be to improve their overall comfort, monitor their activity, look for signs of serious illness, and make sure they drink enough liquids. For questions about over-the-counter medication such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, call your pediatrician. As with any medication, be sure to use the  syringe or dropper  that came with the product to measure the correct amount. Never use a kitchen measuring spoon to dose liquid medicine. Talk to children about COVID-19 facts News coverage and disinformation posted online about COVID-19 can be frightening to kids. Parents and other adults who work closely with children to filter information and talk about it in a way that their child can understand. These tips can help:\t Simple reassurance.  Remind children that researchers and doctors have been closely following the virus throughout the pandemic and their recommendations on vaccines, boosters, masks and other safety steps will help keep them and everyone else safe. \t Give them control.  It's also a great time to remind your children of what they can do to help.\t Monitor their  media .  For older children, talk together about what they are hearing on the news and correct any    misinformation  or    rumors  you may hear by going to reputable sources for information—including your    pediatrician ! Keep young children away from frightening images they may see on TV, social media, and other sources.\t Watch for signs of anxiety.  Children may not have the words to express their worry, but you may see signs of it. They may get cranky, be more clingy, have trouble sleeping, or seem distracted. Keep the reassurance going and try to stick to your normal  routines .\t Be a good role model.  COVID-19 doesn't discriminate, and neither should we. When you show empathy and support to those who are ill, your children will too. More information Do Healthy Young People Need the COVID-19 Vaccine?

        "content": "Part of being on a team is defending and protecting your teammates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the best strategies is proper face mask use to reduce the    risk  of spreading the virus. This is especially important for indoor sports and for players who are not vaccinated or boosted. When and where it's recommended, mask wearing—along with vaccination and boosters, and physical distancing—remain the best tools to decrease the spread of COVID-19. It protects indoor and outdoor group    sports  participants, coaches and spectators. Here's a rundown on the recommendations:\t In counties with \t   high rates  of COVID transmission : Face masks are strongly recommended—even if vaccinated and boosted—for all athletes, coaches and spectators age 2 or older for all    indoor  sports training, competition and on the sidelines.    When travel occurs across county lines, community levels should be checked.\t In any area, regardless of the rate of COVID transmission:  If an athlete or someone on the team or within the home is immunocompromised or considered    high risk , they should wear a face mask indoors, in close proximity situations such as in locker rooms, weight rooms and on transportation. \t Anyone who has symptoms of COVID should not attend games or practices.  They should follow current    CDC guidelines  for isolation and quarantine. Masks should be worn when around others for 10 days after they test positive or develop symptoms for COVID. This includes wearing a mask for all physical activities.  Be a good sport Is someone on your child's team or another team wearing a mask when nobody else is wearing one? Some children, teens and adults may choose to continue wearing face masks. Others must wear masks when they go out so they can protect themselves or their family members. Parents and coaches can remind athletes, spectators and one another that people who wear masks should not be targeted or bullied for their decision. Masks for outdoor group sports  For outdoor group sports, most transmission is related to off-field activities. However, with the new SARS-CoV-2 variants that may infect people more easily, spread during outdoor on-field activities is a greater concern.  Hold on to your face mask \t Coaches, parents and kids should wear face masks whenever they are recommended.  Adults should protect themselves and others by consistently and correctly wearing face masks when needed. By doing this, they set a good example for young athletes. Make it a habit:\t Have a special place to store the mask.  For example, your child might keep it in the same spot in their sports bag when they are not wearing it. \t Make sure that your child can put on and take off the face mask themselves.  Make sure they keep it over their nose and mouth. The mask should fit snugly against the face with no gaps and be comfortable to wear. \t If the face mask is removed for a break , they should remain at least 3 feet away from others. Masks should be removed when participating in:\t Water sports, since wet face masks are more difficult to breathe through.  Athletes participating in swimming, diving and other water sports should not wear a face mask while they are in the water. For the same reason, masks that become soaked with sweat should be changed right away.\t Certain sports and activities in which masks could pose a safety risk.  Face masks should not be worn during certain situations in competitive cheerleading and gymnastics where the masks could get caught on objects, becoming a choking hazard or blocking vision. Likewise, face masks are discouraged while wrestling unless an adult coach or official is closely monitoring for safety.    Remember Safely wearing face masks helps young athletes protect their teammates, themselves, and the sports season. Talk with your child's pediatrician if you have any questions about sports and COVID-19.

        "content": "By: Peter Rowe, MD, FAAP Most kids and teens who test positive for COVID-19 have mild, or even no, symptoms. But it has become clear that some are experiencing symptoms more than a month after they've been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.  A number of    post-COVID conditions  have been identified in kids. Most notable are continued or recurring symptoms referred to as \"long-haul COVID,\" or sometimes as \"long COVID\" or \"Post-Acute COVID-19.\" Research on this condition continues. Who gets long-haul COVID?  No one is certain exactly how many people who've had COVID-19 end up being long haulers. One study showed that as many as 52% of teens and young adults between ages 16 and 30 may experience lingering symptoms 6 months after having COVID. The U.K. Office for National Statistics estimated that 12.9% of children 2 to 11 years of age, and 14.5% of children 12 to 16 years old, still experienced symptoms 5 weeks after infection.  What experts do know is that long-haul COVID can happen even in people who had mild or no symptoms of COVID-19. The symptoms they had during the acute infection may not go away, even long after their infection is gone. Sometimes, long-haul COVID symptoms start after a person is feeling better. Or, if they were asymptomatic (didn't have COVID symptoms), they may experience them weeks later. Any of these symptoms can be new and different, or they may be the same as the ones your child had during the COVID infection.\t \t  COVID-19: We're in it for the Long Haul\t By: Melissa Lynch  \t COVID doesn't affect kids, right? That's what we thought at the beginning of this pandemic.  We had just moved, and local schools were in virtual and hybrid learning mode. We needed the internet line run to our house still, so we went to a public place for WiFi access. There were only about 7 other students in the building. Physical distancing was in place, but masks were not required indoors for gatherings of less than 10 people at that time.  Within 3 days, we learned that one of the children in the building had tested positive for COVID. Within another 3 days, our 11-year-old daughter, Wednesday, started having mild symptoms of COVID. As a precaution, her doctor arranged for care in a virtual hospital for COVID-positive kids. Her symptoms remained mild: headaches, loss of smell, extreme fatigue. I was monitoring her vitals every two hours and reporting to the virtual hospital 3 times a day.  There were only 3 days that were a little risky. Wednesday's oxygen levels dropped into the 70s, so she was given albuterol treatments every 4 hours. Her breathing stabilized, and she was released from the hospital to resume normal activities and school. We didn't realize that our journey had only just begun.  Wednesday only got to return to school one day before the lethargy returned. She saw her primary care doctor and was diagnosed with Post-Acute Covid-19. The lethargy, along with headaches, extreme fatigue and intermittent low-grade fevers, lasted through December.  In January, her cardiologist cleared her to return to normal physical activity. She tried to ease back into cheerleading, but after 3 weeks came home from practice feeling lethargic. She spiked a 103.4 fever and could not get out of bed for 3 days.  Wednesday was unable to keep up even with the virtual classes, falling asleep wherever she sat. We pulled her from a structured school environment to give her the flexibility needed for medical reasons, and homeschooled her. During homeschool, we realized that she was not retaining what she was learning; she could watch a documentary and not remember anything about it.  She had been an Honor Roll student at an award-winning magnet school who tested above her grade level in several subjects. Now, she couldn't even take notes. Her cognitive levels in learning were soon showing her at a 31 percentile and 2 grade levels behind.  Wednesday, now 12, has met testing protocols for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) 3 times. She's been diagnosed with Post-Exertional Malaise and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS). Since January, she has had 23 relapses of post-COVID symptoms. They average about 2 weeks apart. Every relapse seems different with new symptoms each time.  She is declining. At this writing, she has swollen lymph nodes and a 103.2 fever. She is dealing with cardiac symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, chest pressure, fainting and major fluctuations in her blood pressure. She has gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting and abdominal pain, and neurological issues like loss of feeling in her lower extremities. She recently experienced a seizure.  My once happy and energetic child's eyes now cloud over. She glitches like a computer rebooting during normal everyday tasks.  As we've learned all too well, COVID-19 does affect children. Even kids who had no symptoms, or only mild symptoms while infected, can develop the debilitating symptoms of Long COVID. I wouldn't wish this on anyone. \t Melissa Lynch, CMA, RMA, is the USA Lead Director for the international parent organization  Long Covid Kids . What are symptoms of long-haul COVID? The most common symptoms of long-haul COVID include: Fatigue and poor physical endurance Difficulty thinking or concentrating, also known as \"brain fog\" Cough Trouble breathing Joint or muscle pain Chest or stomach pain Mood changes Headache Fever Heart palpitations Loss of or changes in smell or taste Lightheadedness when standing up There are a variety of chronic symptoms your child can experience after having COVID-19. The specific symptoms your child has could depend on how severe their COVID infection was. For instance, if your child was in the intensive care unit (ICU) on a ventilator, they might have fatigue and weak muscles, as well as a fast heart rate and brain fog. These are common effects in people who have spent time in the ICU. How is long-haul COVID diagnosed? There's no specific test to diagnose long-haul COVID, so it's diagnosed based on symptoms. Your pediatrician may run other tests or refer you to a pediatric sub-specialist, especially if symptoms continue more than 3 months. They will want to be certain there's nothing else causing your child's symptoms.  How long does it last? That's still unknown. More studies are needed to understand what's going on. What causes it? Researchers are still trying to figure out what causes some people to experience long-haul COVID. It will probably take some years before we know much. How is it treated? Treatment depends on what symptoms your child is having. Your pediatrician will treat individual symptoms, such as headaches, lightheadedness, or problems sleeping. What about multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)? You may have heard of   \t multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) , a serious condition that may be related to COVID-19. However, doctors don't know for sure yet what causes MIS-C. They just know that many kids who have had it either had COVID-19 or were around someone else who did. Keep in mind that MIS-C is rare. When to seek help If your child has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, stay in touch with your pediatrician to monitor for any lingering symptoms. Many medical centers in the United States are creating post-COVID care clinics so they can treat long-haul COVID more effectively. Your pediatrician can help you find a subspecialist or clinic if your child needs one. Remember COVID-19 vaccines are the best way to protect your family against COVID-19 and post-COVID conditions, including long-haul COVID. Vaccines are  currently available  for anyone 5 years of age and older.  Clinical trials  are underway for children as young as 6 months old.

        "content": "​​​ ​Millions​  of U.S. children and teens have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Fortunately, they have been less likely than adults so far to become very ill. However, even if they had few or no symptoms, kids can develop a number of other conditions after the COVID infection. Some are minor and may go away on their own. Others are more serious and may need treatment. If your child tests positive for COVID-19, talk with your child’s doctor about watching for lingering or new symptoms and what to do if you notice any. Your pediatrician also can help guide your child’s safe return to activities such as school, sports, camp, jobs and volunteer activities.    Symptoms and conditions that can affect children after COVID-19\t Breathing problems.  Because COVID-19 most often affects the lungs, lingering respiratory symptoms are not uncommon. These may include chest pain, cough, and more trouble breathing during exercise. Some of these symptoms can last for 3 months or longer. Children 6 years or older with lasting symptoms may need lung function tests. Children with exercise-induced breathing problems that don’t go away may need heart tests to rule out complications such as blood clots.\t Cardiac issues.  Myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, can develop after COVID-19 (and in extremely rare cases, receiving mRNA    vaccines ). One study of adult patients who recently recovered from COVID-19 suggested that 60% of them had myocarditis, regardless of how severe their COVID symptoms were during the infection. Symptoms of myocarditis may include chest pain, shortness of breath,  irregular heartbeat  and fatigue. Children and teens who had moderate or severe symptoms within the last 6 months need a thorough exam, including heart tests, before returning to school or    sports  activities.\t Smell and taste.  As many as 1 out of 4 children and teens age 10 to 19 years of age who had COVID experience changes to their sense of smell and taste. This can have a negative effect on their eating habits and mood. It can also prevent them from noticing dangerous odors. These symptoms typically go away in several weeks. When it doesn’t, your child’s doctor may recommend steps to test or help retrain these senses.\t Developmental issues.  Acute COVID-19 illness can affect the    nervous system  and, in rare cases, lead to stroke or encephalitis (brain swelling). Children who’ve had COVID-19 may experience subtle changes in attention, speech, school work, movement and mood. Your pediatrician may refer you for follow up with a neurodevelopmental specialist, a speech language pathologist or physical or occupational therapists.\t Mental fatigue.  \"Brain fog\"—unclear or \"fuzzy\" thinking, concentration, or memory—is a frequent complaint among adults who’ve had COVID-19. Children and teens may have similar symptoms. Your child may seem more forgetful or have trouble paying attention. They may be slower at reading and need more repetition and breaks while    learning . Make sure your child get enough sleep and help them manage stress, which can worsen these symptoms. If post-COVID mental fatigue doesn’t improve or interferes with daily activities, your child may benefit from a team-based treatment and recovery plan. \t Physical fatigue.  After SARS-CoV-2 infection, children and teens may tire more easily and have less physical endurance, even if they had no heart or lung symptoms from the virus. This usually improves over time. Your pediatrician can advise a gradual increase in physical activity. If this doesn't improve symptoms, they may recommend a visit to a physical therapist or other specialist. \t Headaches.  Headache is a common symptom during and following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Getting enough sleep, drinking plenty of water, eating regular meals​ and managing stress can help. If the headaches are lasting and severe enough, your child's doctor may recommend preventive medicines.\t Mental and behavioral health.  Having had COVID-19 can affect a child’s mental health. For children with existing mental/behavioral illness, events surrounding COVID-19 (hospitalization, isolation, absence from school activities) may also make symptoms worse. Your pediatrician can check your child for signs of depression, anxiety and other mental health concerns, and advise    when your child may need more support . \t Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children  ( MIS-C ) is a rare complication that typically happens 2 to 6 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination with two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech is reported to prevent MIS-C in kids 12 to 18 years old. In addition, all of the critically ill MIS-C patients who required life support    in a recent study  were unvaccinated.    If your child has symptoms such as fever without an obvious cause after having COVID-19, talk with your pediatrician. MIS-C can get worse quickly, and children who develop this condition should be examined by a pediatrician or pediatric subspecialist as soon as possible. Children with this condition will require hospitalization, often in the intensive care unit .\t Symptoms of diabetes , including frequent urination, increased thirst, increased hunger, weight loss, tiredness or fatigue, stomach pain and nausea or vomiting,   have been    reported  in some children and teens who had COVID-19.   \t Long-haul COVID-19  is a general term that covers physical and mental health symptoms some patients experience 4 or more weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. No specific lab test can tell \" long-haul COVID-19 \" apart from other conditions. For the first 4 to 12 weeks after illness, focusing mostly on healthy lifestyle approaches to help improve symptoms is usually best. If symptoms last beyond 3 months, your child’s doctor may recommend additional tests and possible referral to a specialized, multidisciplinary post-COVID-19 clinic. Remember All children and teens should receive the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as they are    eligible  to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Talk to your pediatrician to make certain they stay up to date. If your child tests positive for COVID-19, your pediatrician can discuss your questions and concerns including ways to help your child return safely to their normal activities.

        "content": "​By Amanda Suplee, PhD & Hailey Nelson, MD, FAAP \t News of a positive  COVID-19 test  can be alarming for both kids and parents. The fear and uncertainty, paired with the frustration of changing plans and routines, can cause heightened emotions for the whole family. But it can be especially distressing for children. Here are some tips to help you talk about a positive COVID-19 test with your child and develop strategies to manage stress. Start the conversation\t Stay calm, especially when giving information to your child.  To \"set the thermostat\" of a conversation, choose a location where you both feel comfortable, safe and calm. Keep your tone of voice and body language relaxed, and the discussion informative and reassuring. Children react to their environment and if you are calm, they will be more likely to stay calm. \t Be honest, and give them an opportunity to ask questions.  Let your child ask questions and provide honest answers that are appropriate for their age and developmental stage. A positive COVID-19 test will mean that their daily routine is about to change, so they may have a lot of questions. Your child may ask, \"Why can't I go to school today?\" for example. You might answer, \"We have to take a break from seeing others for a little while so we can all stay healthy. Your doctor will help us understand when it's okay for us to go to school again.\"\t   Provide reassurance.  Remind them that you and their caregivers will be there to take care of them, and that their pediatrician is always just a phone call away. Share with them in words they can understand and appreciate that most children will only experience a mild, cold-like illness, or may not feel sick at all. \t Tell your child what happens next.  Be clear about the change in routine they can expect going forward for a while. Letting your child know what to expect helps to ease anxiety related to uncertainty. Explain to them what they will need to do to help keep other family members healthy, including wearing a mask, isolating in a different area of the home whenever possible and staying home or avoiding close contact with others for a while. \t Address concerns with solution-focused talks.  In addition to    health concerns , older kids may worry about missed schoolwork. Discuss how you and they can reach out to teachers for assignments and ask for help prioritizing make-up work.  Many kids are also concerned about exposing others to COVID-19. They may be especially worried about family members who have medical conditions or medications that weaken the immune system, or younger siblings who are not yet    eligible  for COVID-19 vaccines. Remind them that there are proven actions we can take to limit the spread of COVID-19, such as physical distancing,    face masks  and hand washing.  You can also use solution-focused talks if your child is upset about missing out on social events while they isolate. Mention ways to stay connected such as video calls, group video games, or making art projects to give to friends. Remind them that they'll be able to see them in person again soon.\t Plan fun distractions.  Dealing with a COVID-19 infection can make your child feel a loss of control. Give them a chance to make some decisions for themselves, like which book to read or what food they would like to eat. Being able to make even small decisions can help your child cope with illness and give them back a sense of control and certainty. \t Keep the conversation going.  Encourage your child to tell you how they are feeling, both emotionally and physically. This will help you keep track of symptoms and their level of    stress . Create a safe space for your child to talk about their feelings and be willing to    reach out for professional help  if needed. Offering a listening and non-judgmental ear lets your child know they're not alone. This can make a big difference, even if you don't have a solution.  Manage stress As a parent and caregiver, it is essential to not only help your child cope with the stress they may be feeling, but to acknowledge your own mental and emotional health, too. To help you  manage  the stress you may experience when dealing with a COVID-19 infection in the home, keep these tips in mind:\t Limit time on social media and news.  It's easy to get sucked into social media feeds and    breaking headlines  discussing current topics. This can not only be stressful, but can also be a source of misinformation. Instead, try to rely on COVID-19 updates directly from a trusted health source. \t Take care of yourself!  Your child's positive test and the sudden need to alter daily life may make you feel a loss of control, too. Try to eat regular, healthy meals, stay hydrated and get enough rest.    Taking care  of your physical health will benefit your mental health at the same time. Let go of tasks that are non-essential and focus on things that you can control. This includes your own self-care, mindfulness, and physical health while you nurture your child 's physical and emotional well-being during this time. \t Reach out for support and connection.  Stay in touch with your support system with texts, phone calls, or video chat services and don't be afraid to reach out for professional help if needed. When you check in with loved ones, encourage those who are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine to get vaccinated as soon as they can. Reach out to your child's pediatrician if you have questions about the COVID-19 vaccine. Talk about vaccines & other tools COVID-19 vaccines are safe and    effective ; they prevent serious illness and hospitalization in children. Vaccines, along with well-fitting face masks, physical distancing and other    tools  we now have, can protect us and everyone around us.  If your child is vaccinated  Testing positive can be a frustrating situation. In this case, it can be reassuring to know that the vaccine is helping them fight the infection. Consider discussing with your child that their symptoms are milder because they have been    vaccinated . If your child is not fully vaccinated  As soon as your child is feeling better, and is out of isolation, they    can and should  still get fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Vaccines and boosters have been shown to decrease severe illness and complications from COVID-19 infections. Prepare for your child's vaccination appointment with this    handy checklist . Remember As you work through helping your child heal from a COVID-19 infection, remember: be kind to yourself and others. Parents often struggle with the news that their child has tested positive for COVID-19. Be patient with yourself and know that you are doing the very best you can to help your child get better. Talk to your pediatrician if you have questions about your child's symptoms, or if they are getting worse. Your pediatrician can also answer any questions you may have about the COVID-19 vaccine and how it can help protect your child's health.

        "content": "Many families are asking when their children should be tested for  COVID-19 . Your pediatrician can help determine when testing may be a good idea, and which type of test would be best. They can also help you follow up on your child's test results. When to test To determine which test to recommend, your pediatrician will consider: your child's symptoms whether they have been exposed to a close contact illnesses currently going around COVID-19 has similar symptoms to other illnesses such as    influenza  and respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ). It's also possible to have two of these illnesses    at the same time . Because of this, children and teens with COVID-19    symptoms  may be tested for more than one virus (such as flu and COVID-19). \t Children and teens who have  symptoms  of COVID-19 should be tested without delay  to find out if they have an active infection. This is especially important if they have in-person activities, so that anyone who may have been exposed can be alerted.  Where should my child be tested? Your pediatrician can test or refer your child for testing. You can also find a    free onsite testing location near you . There are many ways to get at-home rapid tests for free, too, including: \t Online:  Families can receive a package of 4 free at-⁠home COVID-⁠19 tests by mail. Visit www.covidtests.gov.\t Through your health plan:  Insurance companies and health plans are now required to    cover  8 free over-the-counter at-home tests per person per month. That means a family of four, all on the same plan, would be able to get up to 32 of these tests covered by their health plan each month. \t In the community:  If you have    Original Medicare  or do not have private health insurance, at-home tests are available at a community health center or clinic.  Safe storage of at-home tests\t   If you have COVID-19 test kits in your home, be sure to store them safely. The    liquid solution  in the tests can be harmful if swallowed or spilled on the skin or in the eyes.  \t   Parents should not allow children younger than 14 years old to use test kits on their own. An adult should handle the swab and test liquid. To prevent poisoning,    experts advise  parents not to open the kit until needed and dispose of it right away after use.\t   Always store test kits and medication    out of the reach  and sight of children and pets. If your child is exposed to the liquid solution, call the national Poison Center Hotline at 1-800-222-1222.   \t What if my child was in close contact with someone who has COVID-19? They should quarantine and be tested right away if not fully vaccinated—even if they don't have symptoms. If the test is negative, test again 5 to 7 days after the last contact with the person who has COVID-19. Test right away if symptoms develop.   If they are fully vaccinated and do not have symptoms, test 5 to 7 days after the last contact with the person who has COVID-19. Test right away if symptoms develop. If your child has recovered from COVID-19 within the past 90 days, call your doctor about testing or if new symptoms develop.  Testing may be recommended at other times. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using a self-test before joining indoor gatherings with others who are not in your household, or if you live with someone at higher risk for severe COVID-19. Testing also is useful before a scheduled medical procedure or travel.  What if my child was diagnosed with COVID-19 previously or got a COVID-19 vaccine?\t COVID-19 vaccines  are safe, highly effective, and children should get them as soon as they are eligible. However, no vaccine provides 100% protection against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, some SARS-CoV-2 variant strains are more contagious and may still infect people who have been vaccinated or who have already had COVID-19. Typically, COVID-19 infection after vaccination results in mild or even no symptoms, but your child can still spread the virus. Types of COVID-19 tests There are currently two main types of COVID-19 tests available to detect a current infection: molecular tests and antigen tests. Your pediatrician can help describe what each test can and cannot do, and when tests can be most useful for your child's situation. Molecular tests  Molecular tests, also called nucleic acid amplification tests, look for pieces of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the respiratory tract. They generally use a nasal or throat swab or sometimes saliva for the test sample. You might get results the same day or up to a week later.  They are \"diagnostic tests,\" which means they are used to check if your child has an active infection. These tests will not tell if your child had COVID-19 in the past.  Types of molecular tests include:\t Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.  These are highly accurate. A PCR test authorized or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considered the \"gold standard\" to determine if a child has an active COVID-19 infection. It can detect COVID-19 variants, including the    delta  variant and the    omicron  variant.  Until we know more about how well they work for children, other tests such as the \"loop-mediated isothermal amplification\" (LAMP) and \"nicking enzyme amplification reaction\" (NEAR) tests are not a replacement for PCR tests. They are not to be used to clear children for return to activity after exposure to or symptoms of COVID-19.  Antigen tests Another kind of diagnostic test is an antigen test. It uses a nasal or throat swab. Some antigen tests are approved to give results in 30 minutes or less. These tests are generally reliable. Sometimes, PCR tests are useful for confirming results, such as during later points in an illness or if a child had no symptoms. Testing is free\t   Free rapid, at-home tests are available for everyone.\t Families can receive a package of 4 free at-⁠home COVID-⁠19 tests by mail. Visit    www.covidtests.gov . Insurance companies and health plans are now required to cover 8 free over-the-counter at-home tests per person per month. That means a family of four, all on the same plan, would be able to get up to 32 of these tests covered by their health plan each month. If you have Original Medicare or do not have private health insurance, at-home tests are available at a community health center or clinic. You can also find a free onsite testing location near you. \"\t   How do antibody tests work?  Antibody (serology) tests are not useful to diagnose a current infection. These tests check a sample of blood for special proteins called antibodies. The body makes antibodies to get rid of viruses and bacteria that cause us to get sick. An antibody test can tell if your child has had COVID-19 at some point in the past, even if there were no symptoms. Some antibody tests can detect that your child was vaccinated. After your child first shows symptoms of being sick, it can take up to two weeks before a antibodies in the blood can be detected by a test.  Does a positive antibody test mean my child is immune to COVID-19? Based on what we know today, a positive antibody test does not confirm protection against the COVID-19 virus. Research shows that people who have recovered from a COVID infection can still get infected again with SARS-CoV-2. Antibody tests should not be used to make decisions about safe entering or returning to group settings like  schools ,  child care , or dorms.  Remember After your child has a diagnostic or antibody test, it is important to talk with your pediatrician about positive or negative test results and what to do next. Continue to follow steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 such as wearing  face masks ,  physical distancing  and  hand washing.  Finally, everyone age 5 and older should get the    vaccine  and everyone age 12 and older should get a booster shot    when it is time . If you have any concerns about your child's health, call your pediatrician.

        "content": "​​​​​While kids have been staying home more during the pandemic, keeping them safe when you need to travel is important. Using the right    car seat , booster seat, or seat belt for every ride can save your child's life. Preventing the spread of COVID-19 during travel is also an important part of  safe transportation . How to clean car seats and seat belts It may be tempting to clean and    disinfect  your child's car seat the same way you do doorknobs, countertops, and even your steering wheel--with a disinfecting wipe, for example, or a spray of diluted bleach and water. For most surfaces, that's fine. Car seats and seat belts are different, though. Using a disinfecting chemical on them can cause damage to the belts leading the car seat or seat belt to fail in the event of a crash. Most car seats, booster seats, and seat belts    cannot  be disinfected but they can be cleaned with a mild detergent and water. Check the instruction manual for your car seat or booster seat and the owner's manual for your vehicle to find out what cleaning products are allowed. How to make a car seat or vehicle safe after exposure to COVID-19  If your child or any other person tests positive or has been exposed to COVID-19 and has been in the car, take the following steps: Clean and disinfect the spot where that person rode including the seats, door handles, window and lock buttons, steering wheel, gearshift, and other hard surfaces within 6 feet of where they were. Remove the car seats and place them out of reach or in a tightly sealed plastic bag for a few days. Wear gloves, a mask, and eye protection while handling the car seats, and wash your hands thoroughly afterward. After a few days, you can use the car seats safely again.    If your child must ride in the car during this time, you will need to use another car seat that fits your child and your car.\t Remember: seat belts cannot be disinfected.  If you have another vehicle, it would be a good idea to use that vehicle instead of the one that has been exposed to COVID-19. Or, do not use that seating position for a few days. Weather permitting, parking in the sun and airing out the vehicle with the windows open may help get rid of the virus more quickly. After a few days, you can clean the seat belt with mild soap and water and use it again. To further prevent the spread of COVID-19 in your vehicle, try to limit passengers to those who live in your home, not anyone outside your family. Also, if your child always rides in the same car seat, booster seat, or seat belt and nobody else rides in that spot, and nobody who rides in the car shows signs of COVID-19, routine cleaning (not disinfecting) is acceptable. What to expect from schools, child care, and others who transport your child  As    schools , Head Start, child care, and other programs reopen, many children will ride in a vehicle that transports a lot of kids, like a school bus, child care van, or other larger vehicle. Programs should have written policies explaining how they will prevent infection during transportation. They also should have plans for how they will make the vehicle safe if a passenger tests positive or is exposed to COVID-19. Here are some things to look for: Programs should make a detailed seating plan so that the same child always uses the same seat, car seat, or harness device and no other child uses it.  Buses should load from back to front and unload from front to back. If a child tests positive or shows signs of the virus, the seating position, car seat, and seat belt or harness should be removed or taken out of service for a few days. After that, it can be cleaned and used again. How to stay safe on public transportation Public transportation often includes many passengers in small areas, which can increase the risk of COVID-19 spreading. It may be safer to walk or use a private vehicle while COVID-19 is spreading. When you do ride a train or bus, practice physical distancing as much as possible, wear face masks, and use    hand sanitizer  frequently. When you arrive home, wash your hands thoroughly and consider changing into clean clothes.  What if my child has special needs?  For children with    special health needs , transportation plans must address both crash protection and prevention of infection. If your child has an    IEP , the school is responsible for providing safe transportation. If your child has a weakened immune system, talk with your pediatrician about the risks and benefits of going to school or other activities in person. Some kids may be safest with online learning until rates of COVID-19 infection are under control in their communities. For a child with a tracheostomy tube, use extra caution during transportation to lower the chance of spreading respiratory droplets, which can carry the virus. Caregivers should wear protective equipment and perform suctioning and other procedures in larger spaces outside the vehicle whenever possible. Children who use a wheelchair and transfer to another seat, like a school bus, may be at risk from close contact with caregivers. It may be safer to use a transit wheelchair that can be anchored to the vehicle. Remember This guidance is only one part of keeping children safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether at home or on the go, it's important to keep a physical    distance  of at least 6 feet whenever possible, wear  face masks , and    wash hands  frequently.

        "content": "​​​As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, you may wonder if it's safe for your kids to participate in organized sports — especially if they're not yet  eligible​  for COVID vaccines.  It helps to understand the rules everyone needs to follow during the  COVID-19​  pandemic to prevent the virus from spreading. It is also important to consider how many people are infected with the virus in your community, and what is best for your family. To you make an informed decision, we have broken down some key risk factors associated with sports participation during the pandemic. What type of sport or activity is it? Sports and physical activities that allow for individual participation and    physical distancing , like golf or singles tennis, are going to be less risky than sports that involve a lot of close contact like basketball or wrestling. \t    Do players share equipment? Sports and physical activities without shared equipment, like cross country, will likely be less risky than sports such as football that are played with a shared ball. \t    How long are athletes in contact with each other? Sports and physical activities with limited exposure to other players may be a safer option. A sprint in a track race, for example, may be less risky than sports that put someone in close contact with another player for an extended period of time, like an entire half of a game. \t    Is it an inside or outside sport? Where athletes train, practice and compete also impacts risk. COVID-19 is more likely to spread in closed indoor spaces with poor ventilation. Indoor sports and activities will likely be more risky, evidence suggests, especially wrestling and ice hockey. Choose outdoor venues for sports and classes whenever possible. \t    How many players are on the team?  The more people someone interacts with, the greater the chance of COVID-19 exposure. So small teams, practice pods or classes that stay together, rather than mixing with other teams, coaches or teachers, will be a safer option. This will also make it easier to contact individuals if there is an exposure to COVID-19. \t    Do the teams travel? Staying within your community will be safer than participating on travel teams. Traveling to an area with more COVID-19 cases could increase the chance of transmission and spread. Travel sports also include intermixing of players, so athletes are generally exposed to more people.\t    Are face masks being worn? Wearing  face masks  reduces the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Masks are extra important at sport events where it's common for coaches, players, officials and spectators to raise their voices shouting, singing or chanting. Athletes should wear face masks for all practices and competitions, except in  certain sports  that could be less safe with masks or those with low SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk. Coaches, officials, volunteers, and spectators should also wear face masks.  \t    Is everyone following COVID-19 safety procedures?  In order to create safer environments for everyone, new safety procedures should be in place for practices and games. Parents, athletes, coaches and officials need to work together to help keep everyone healthy and safe by following them! When people do not follow these precautions, it can put the whole team at risk. So remember to be a good teammate and fan and follow the new safety rules.  \t See \t   Youth Sports Participation During COVID-19: A Safety Checklist  for more information.  \t   Remember  Participating in sports and other physical activities offers a lot of benefits for children and young people. It can improve cardiovascular health, strength, body composition, and overall ﬁtness.    Exercise  even has immune system beneﬁts. Plus, socializing with friends and coaches, and returning to a more structured    routine , can    boost  a child's mental health.

        "content": "​​​As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, you may wonder if it's safe for your kids to participate in organized sports — especially if they're not yet  eligible​  for COVID vaccines.  It helps to understand the rules everyone needs to follow during the  COVID-19​  pandemic to prevent the virus from spreading. It is also important to consider how many people are infected with the virus in your community, and what is best for your family. To you make an informed decision, we have broken down some key risk factors associated with sports participation during the pandemic. What type of sport or activity is it? Sports and physical activities that allow for individual participation and    physical distancing , like golf or singles tennis, are going to be less risky than sports that involve a lot of close contact like basketball or wrestling. \t    Do players share equipment? Sports and physical activities without shared equipment, like cross country, will likely be less risky than sports such as football that are played with a shared ball. \t    How long are athletes in contact with each other? Sports and physical activities with limited exposure to other players may be a safer option. A sprint in a track race, for example, may be less risky than sports that put someone in close contact with another player for an extended period of time, like an entire half of a game. \t    Is it an inside or outside sport? Where athletes train, practice and compete also impacts risk. COVID-19 is more likely to spread in closed indoor spaces with poor ventilation. Indoor sports and activities will likely be more risky, evidence suggests, especially wrestling and ice hockey. Choose outdoor venues for sports and classes whenever possible. \t    How many players are on the team?  The more people someone interacts with, the greater the chance of COVID-19 exposure. So small teams, practice pods or classes that stay together, rather than mixing with other teams, coaches or teachers, will be a safer option. This will also make it easier to contact individuals if there is an exposure to COVID-19. \t    Do the teams travel? Staying within your community will be safer than participating on travel teams. Traveling to an area with more COVID-19 cases could increase the chance of transmission and spread. Travel sports also include intermixing of players, so athletes are generally exposed to more people.\t    Are face masks being worn? Wearing  face masks  reduces the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Masks are extra important at sport events where it's common for coaches, players, officials and spectators to raise their voices shouting, singing or chanting. Athletes should wear face masks for all practices and competitions, except in  certain sports  that could be less safe with masks or those with low SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk. Coaches, officials, volunteers, and spectators should also wear face masks.  \t    Is everyone following COVID-19 safety procedures?  In order to create safer environments for everyone, new safety procedures should be in place for practices and games. Parents, athletes, coaches and officials need to work together to help keep everyone healthy and safe by following them! When people do not follow these precautions, it can put the whole team at risk. So remember to be a good teammate and fan and follow the new safety rules.  \t See \t   Youth Sports Participation During COVID-19: A Safety Checklist  for more information.  \t   Remember  Participating in sports and other physical activities offers a lot of benefits for children and young people. It can improve cardiovascular health, strength, body composition, and overall ﬁtness.    Exercise  even has immune system beneﬁts. Plus, socializing with friends and coaches, and returning to a more structured    routine , can    boost  a child's mental health. But consider the risks involved during the pandemic, and make sure the chance of being exposed to and spreading the virus can be kept to a minimum.

        "content": "By: Kevin Osterhoudt, MD, MSCE, FAAP, FAACT, FACMT\t Washing hands  with soap and clean water for at least 20 seconds is the best way for children to get rid of germs, including the virus that causes  COVID-19 . If soap and water are not available, you can use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. However, use it with care around children, since swallowing hand sanitizer can cause poisoning. Remember to keep hand sanitizers out of children's reach.  Don't forget about travel-size bottles of sanitizer in purses, diaper bags, backpacks and cars. Supervise children ages 5 and younger when they use hand sanitizer. And when using hand sanitizer dispensers, it is important to position them in a way that won't squirt into your child's eyes.  Types of alcohol in hand sanitizers Many hand sanitizers are made with alcohol or rubbing alcohol (ethanol, ethyl alcohol, or isopropanol, isopropyl alcohol). Alcohol poisoning symptoms include loss of balance, sleepiness, low blood sugar, seizures and coma, and it can be fatal.  Children and adults also have been poisoned after using hand sanitizer that contained methanol (also called wood alcohol, methyl alcohol, or methylated spirits). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued    recalls  for products containing methanol, which is toxic if swallowed or after repeated use on skin. It can cause problems ranging from nausea and headaches to blindness, nervous system damage or death. An FDA    import alert  also warns about products found to contain methanol and/or 1-propanol, another form of alcohol that should not be used in hand sanitizers.    Hand sanitizer poisonings during the COVID-19 pandemic Since families began buying more hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Poison Data System has been getting many more reports of unintentional exposures in children. Many are for children ages 5 years and younger.  Health experts recommend using hand sanitizer that is 60% to 95% alcohol to kill the virus that causes COVID-19. Drinking alcohol typically has 5% to 40% alcohol.  Check the label Before buying or using hand sanitizer, make sure it has a label that lists the ingredients, warnings and precautions. In addition, it's a good idea to check the do-not-use list at  www.fda.gov/handsanitizerlist . To reduce the risk of injury from children drinking hand sanitizers, producers should add ingredients to make them taste bitter. This important step helps prevent children from eating the product.  At the start of the pandemic, the FDA began letting distilleries and other companies that do not normally produce hand sanitizer make and sell it to help meet demand. At the same time, the FDA received alerts that some young people have tried drinking hand sanitizers from distilleries that have not taken the step to make them taste bad. It has since ended this temporary policy and now expects careful production standards. You can check for bitter ingredients such as denatonium benzoate (Bitrex); sucrose octaacetate; or butanol (also called tert-butyl alcohol). Current denatured hand sanitizers are made to taste bitter, but you should dispose of any old bottles of \"denatured alcohol,\" which may have toxic methanol added.  Be especially careful with hand sanitizers made with isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) around children. These can be more toxic than those made with ethanol or ethyl alcohol. Is homemade hand sanitizer a good idea? Make-your-own hand sanitizer recipes, widely available on the internet, may not be the best option for families. The FDA warns that if made incorrectly, hand sanitizer may not work. There have also been reports of skin burns from homemade hand sanitizer. How to dispose of recalled hand sanitizers Do not flush or pour recalled hand sanitizers down the drain. These products should be disposed of in hazardous waste containers, if possible. If unsure, check with your local waste management and recycling center. When to call 911\t Call 911  right away  if your child has collapsed, is having a seizure, is having a hard time breathing, or if they can't wake up after using or swallowing hand sanitizer products. Otherwise, you can reach your regional poison control center by calling 1-800-222-1222. Talk with your pediatrician If you have questions about hand sanitizers, talk with your pediatrician. Your regional Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit ( PEHSU ) have staff who can also talk with parents about concerns over environmental toxins.

        "content": "​By: David Hill, MD, FAAP & Jann Blackstone, PsyD Parenting is challenging enough when both parents live in the same home. When they live apart, as after a separation or    divorce , things can get even harder. Parents may    disagree  on such basic issues as    sleep , nutrition, and discipline with added layers of negative emotions like anger, frustration, and sadness. All of these can interfere with effective communication and problem-solving. While a crisis like the    COVID-19  pandemic can add to the stress of co-parenting, it can also help parents overcome their issues and work together to safeguard the children they both love.  Special considerations for two-household families  Ideally, co-parents should have a plan in place to help them problem-solve in time of crisis. If they do not, they may have no idea how to talk calmly or make decisions together under stressful conditions. Many problem-solve the same way they did when they were together. They may argue, withhold, and possibly bully, when what they need to do is stand back and unselfishly ask themselves, \"How can we work together to keep our child safe?\" \t   Until this crisis is over,     physical distancing  to slow the spread of COVID-19 may require divorced or separated parents to temporarily change the way they share their children's time as they normally would.  Key questions to ask Here are some questions that can help co-parents talk through the possible need to adjust their child's visitation schedule: Is it truly in the child's best interest to continue to follow the parenting plan that is in place, sending the child back and forth between homes?  Is one parent better able to support    home schooling  than the other? For example, is internet service equally available at both homes? Does one parent have a job that involves more contact with the public and therefore more risk for household members? Who else lives in the home, and how much contact do they have with the public? Is a household member in a high-risk group: over the age of 60, suffering from underlying medical conditions, or immunocompromised? Does one home have more space or better access to    safe outdoor spaces  where children can play and get exercise while keeping the recommended physical distance?  Notice that these questions do not take previous parenting plans into consideration. Instead, they ask parents to honestly consider what changes must be made now to keep their children and others in the home safe.   This becomes especially difficult when parents worry about giving up any time with their child for fear it means their son or daughter may prefer the other parent, or that the other parent is manipulating the situation. Another sticky question can be whether more child support must be paid if the parenting plan changes. Also, many parents worry that if they allow the parenting plan to be adjusted, they will never get the time back. How co-parents can work together \t   Keep communication open. Answer all forms of communication (phone calls, texts, emails, etc.) with your co-parent in a timely manner.\t Don't keep score.\t Enter each conversation with finding a solution together as your goal. \t Stay socially connected while physical distanced. Schedule    virtual visits  between your co-parent and your child. Set a time and make the child available for video calls. \t Once this crisis is over, set aside extra time so that the non-custodial parent and child can become comfortable together again.       Remember Everyone is having to adapt to some uncomfortable changes during this pandemic. It has disrupted childcare, school and work, shifting the patterns of our lives. Reassure your child that we will get through this, that some changes are only temporary, and most importantly, they are loved.

        "content": "​​​​By: Kenneth Ginsburg, MD, MS Ed, FAAP​ ​As parents, we want to protect our children from witnessing the fear and uncertainty brought by ​the      COVID-19  pandemic. We wish we could take away the disruption to their education, activities and relationships. And, we wish they were not exposed to suffering. We cannot control these circumstances, but we      can  work to strengthen our relationships during this time while building our children's resilience. We      can  remember to say what so many of our grandparents said to us: “This too shall pass, and you'll get through this with me by your side.\"​ The best way to protect our children is to shape the lessons gained during this difficult time. We do so best when we intentionally manage​​ our own feelings and experiences with an eye toward helping them build resilience. ​Below are some of the feelings many of us are experiencing, paired with the chance they offer us to model and teach lifelong resilience skills. ​ “I feel like I am failing\": Learning self-forgiveness​ Perfection is not an option here. Know that if you forgive yourself and focus on the good in yourself now through self-compassion, your child or adolescent will learn to be a bit gentler with themselves. That is lifelong protection. ​ “My kids are frustrated, and so am I\": Learning to empathize  ​One of the most respectful things we can do is genuinely understand someone else's point of view. The best way for children to gain this perspective is by benefitting from it firsthand. You build their empathy for others by working to understand their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.  ​“I don't know how to handle how I feel\": Processing and releasing emotions ​A time of uncertainty with heightened emotions is the time to show that emotions are not to be ignored. Our children must learn from us that having emotions is good, talking about them is necessary and being honest with them is healing. ​ “I want to pull my hair out\": Creating a safe haven within our homes​ You can love your child and still sometimes want to tear your hair out. We all have bad days when the stress load is high, and it's high now. We cannot control the outside world, but we create sanctuaries within our homes. With peace in our homes, we can better handle the outside world. ​“I need a time out\": Being a calming presence for others In moments when the future is unclear and our minds begin racing toward worse case scenarios, the presence of a reassuring voice makes all the difference. ​ “I don't know how to respond\": Being clear and honest with yourself and others ​ Say what you do know. Admit what you don't. “My mind feels out of control\": Maintaining physical health strengthens emotional health​ Strong bodies support our minds to best navigate the circumstances we confront. Say out loud: “I can't just sit on the couch all day. I'm going to exercise. If I don't take care of my body, I can't focus as well.\" ​​ “I keep thinking about the worst-case scenario\": Stay present and live in reality ​ Uncertainty can make our minds race to the worst possible outcome. Catch those thoughts and say, “I am imagining the worst. Let me focus on what is really happening.\" Young people can assume the worst because they have not      yet  had the experience to know that crises come and go. Let them know “You'll get through this with me by your side.\"​ “I feel helpless\": Finding what you can do​ Few things create discomfort more than feeling like there is too much to do . . . or nothing you can do at all. And few things restore comfort more than tackling what you can. Model the importance of one of the most calming words: “Yet.\" “I'll NEVER ______!\" can transform into “I haven't ______ yet.\" Don't accept failure or disappointment as permanent but instead view setbacks as opportunities to try      yet  again. ​ “I can't do everything\": Learning to let go​ Stay healthy, strong, and compassionate. Take care of those who are vulnerable. Let family members know they are precious. Do what it takes to keep a roof over your head and food on the table. Everything else can wait. ​ “I am so disappointed\": Find joy, give service, and maintain purpose​ Help your children see the difference they can make in others' lives and how good it feels to give service. This may enhance their own resilience because they'll learn the joy of giving. More important, they'll learn there is no pity in receiving. ​ “I had so many plans that aren't working out\": When you can't change things, adapt​ Many of our plans are not working out. Focus on what you      can  make a reality and what you      can  do. ​ “I miss my family and friends\": Relationships strengthen us​ This is a generational defining moment. If this generation learns that when times get tough, people unify, it will be the generation who can lead us into a better shared future--one in which we hold those we love nearer and offer those who are vulnerable the extra support they deserve. ​ “Will things ever be the same?\": Hope​ Resilience is about more than bouncing back. It is about adapting. Growing. Becoming stronger. Being ready for the next challenge, but also being prepared to savor all the good life has to offer. I hope that by the time you read this, the most difficult times will have passed. But, I also hope that these lessons endure.  Uncertainty is frightening, but knowing that we are not alone to figure it out brings comfort. Any individual alone is vulnerable, but joined together we are stronger than the combination of each of our individual strengths. People together can take turns between drawing strength from others and being a source of strength. We will get through this when we come together! \t ​If you found this article helpful, download this                     free online-exclusive chapter  from Dr. Ginsburg's new book,                     Building Resilience in​​ Children and Teens: Giving Kids Roots and Wings, 4th edition .

Think nature exploration! Read on for ways that you and your children can get a physical and emotional  boost  from being outdoors while still practicing good social distancing. Exploring the outdoors while social distancing\t Nature all around us.  Exploring outside with proper social distancing can happen in your yard, a table-top garden, or even      virtually  (though not with all of the benefits). \t Bringing out baby.  Even infants and toddlers can play and learn in nature. If you will be in public areas like a park, it may be safest to keep them in a carrier or a stroller. If they are in your own private space, it's fine to have them explore even more.\t Nature sculptures  can be built with twigs, leaves, cones, rocks and more by sticking the collected items into a play dough base. Notice what kind of patterns are created by different items. Or, let your child play in mud with old pots, pans, utensils, and household tools to develop senses and motor skills.\t Bike or walk with the family  while keeping your distance from others. If you have a            child bicycle trailer  or stroller, get some exercise while enjoying the outdoors with your baby. Describe what you see along the way to your baby or preschooler.  Use a lot of details to help them learn new words.\t ​Take story time outside.   Grab a blanket, some books and find a shady spot to            read  ​with your child outdoors.  Pick books that talk about nature and help your child make connections.\t Challenge older children & teens.  Stay engaged with the outdoors as a family. Take advantage of this time to bond over games and activities you all enjoy.\t Hold a nature scavenger hunt  or start a nature collection.   Hunt for plants, trees, animals, and birds. Collect rocks, acorns, leaves or pinecones.  See how many items children can find on a list, or gather objects to add to a collection.\t Leave a trail.   Organize with parents of your children's friends to send kids on \"secret spy missions.\" One family goes on a walk with sidewalk chalk, drawing arrows and letters along the way to spell out a secret message. The other family must then follow the arrows along the way to record the letters in the message.\t Have a ball.  Kicking a soccer ball or playing catch together can be fine if you are apart from each other and avoid sharing sports equipment with others outside your household. The benefits of being outside Getting outside provides more than a fun break for children and teens. It is also good for their physical and mental health and development. Children and teens who spend time enjoying nature can be:\t Physically healthier.  Children      play  harder outdoors than indoors. Especially without the structure of preschool, school or afterschool activities, children especially need opportunities to      move . More outdoor time is linked with improved motor development and lower obesity rates. \t More engaged in learning.  Playing outside promotes more curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking. Studies have found that children who spent more time in nature exploration had improved learning outcomes.\t More positive in behavior.  Research has found that when children spent time in natural settings they had less      anger and aggression . Impulse control also improves. This might be especially important when normal routines have changed for children.\t Mentally healthier.  Stress and depression are lower for all people who spend time in nature. Children show increased focus and reduced symptoms of for      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder . Reme​mber Take advantage of the healing  power of play  in nature—in your own backyard or on a walk. Be sure to follow local public health guidelines about      wearing masks ​ and keep at least 6 feet from others not in your family.  Wash your hands  with soap and water or use  hand sanitizer  during and after your adventure.

        "content": "The ability to communicate is one of our most basic needs. Communication allows us to express our feelings, develop meaningful connections with loved ones, and share information with others. While most people think of communication as talking, it's much more than that. From a very young age, babies communicate by gurgling, giggling and crying. They reach for objects and people. They babble simple to increasingly complex strings of sounds. Around one year of age, they start to use their first words. However, some children don't begin to talk—or communicate—as expected. Some children may be helped with    augmentative and alternative communication  (AAC). What is augmentative and alternative communication?  AAC is one way that a person may communicate without talking.    Augmentative  means to add to someone's speech.    Alternative  means to be used instead of speech. You may have seen someone in your life or on TV using a tablet or different device to type or even speak their words for them. These high-tech devices are methods of AAC. However, AAC can also involve little to no technology—such as providing a toddler or child with a paper or board with pictures that lets them point to what they want to say (more on that below)! Not every tool works for every person, which is why it's important that families consult with a speech-language pathologist (SLP) who has experience with AAC. These professionals can help your child develop the language they need to reliably communicate with you, their friends, teachers and anyone else who they interact with in their daily lives. Who should use AAC? Children who can benefit from AAC include those with communication disorders or medical diagnoses that make it difficult to be understood by their family, caregivers, and peers. Some children have a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, childhood apraxia of speech, developmental language disorder, dysarthria, stroke, traumatic brain injury or voice disorder. However, anyone who has unreliable speech may benefit from the use of AAC. AAC can be used at any age, even during the infant and toddler years. How can AAC help my child? AAC offers many benefits, especially when it's introduced early in a child's life. Most importantly, AAC allows children who have difficulty communicating to effectively express their ideas, feelings, needs and wants. Early introduction of AAC can positively impact:\t Communication and language skills:  Birth to three years is the most rapid period of brain development in a person's life. This is a time when children are developing the communication and language skills that are the foundation for later school and career success. When AAC is used during the early years, it can help children develop a strong language base and aid them in meeting their expected developmental milestones in language, communication and early reading and writing—similar to their peers who don't use AAC. This early use of AAC can also sometimes help to increase the amount of verbal speech.\t Social interactions : AAC encourages social interactions between children and their peers, family members and caregivers. When a child can share their thoughts, this creates opportunities for bonding and helps them develop a sense of belonging. Children can express their unique personalities and even tell jokes using AAC.\t Behavior : AAC can help reduce tantrums and other behavioral challenges that may occur when a child can't communicate their wants, needs and feelings. If a child is hungry, tired or in pain and unable to express that clearly, they understandably may become very frustrated and rely on other behaviors to alert loved ones to their situation.\t School achievement : For school-age children, AAC is a tool that helps them to participate in school, making learning more accessible. AAC users can contribute to group activities and express to teachers what they have learned from academic lessons. Myths & misconceptions about AAC Parents and caregivers may have concerns about using AAC based on myths or misconceptions. Here are some myths and facts that anyone considering AAC for their child should know. Myth: AAC interferes with verbal speech development, and it's better to work exclusively on oral speech.\t Fact: AAC does NOT prevent or reduce verbal speech. Research shows that using AAC actually supports verbal speech and language development. While some people use AAC their whole life, others use it temporarily (even for a few months). AAC can reduce frustration and set the foundation for improved communication skills. It also helps with learning language in infancy and toddlerhood, which are critical for later literacy skills. Myth: AAC should only be considered when a child is older, or as a last resort after trying other methods.\t Fact: AAC can be introduced very early, even before a child turns one. Using AAC will not prevent your child from talking. If a child is having difficulty communicating, there's no need to wait. AAC can be considered in consultation with a pediatrician and SLP at any time, including as part of Early Intervention programs (available in all States and territories in the U.S.). AAC should not be seen as a last resort, but rather as an early tool to support communication. It's important for parents to know that some older children who may not have had success with AAC early may still benefit from trying AAC again. Myth: If your child is using AAC, they should begin with non-tech options such as single paper pictures before trying any electronic tool.\t FACT: There is no correct order for learning AAC. The right tool is based on the individual child. Multiple types of AAC should be always available to support the child in case one option is ineffective (e.g., battery runs out, water ruins the paper, etc.). Just as anyone uses gestures, verbal speech, and written language to communicate, an AAC user can be effective using many types of low-, mid- and high-tech tools. Myth: AAC is only for home or school.\t Fact: AAC should accompany a child everywhere. The need to communicate is not limited to home or school. Just as people who use verbal speech always have their voice with them, a child should always have their AAC tools available to express their wants and needs. For example, the AAC tools should always be brought with the child to any medical appointments. Myth: AAC is only appropriate for children with autism spectrum disorder.\t Fact: AAC is NOT limited to children with autism spectrum disorder. Any child who experiences unreliable speech can benefit from AAC. This includes children with cerebral palsy, some chromosomal or genetic disorders, brain injury, dysarthria, speech/voice disorders, and various other developmental conditions.\t Myth: AAC is limited to high-tech speech-generating devices that are very expensive.\t Fact: AAC involves a wide range of options. These include supports that require nothing but your own body (such as gestures, body posture, and manual signs); low-tech or no-tech options such as paper boards using pictures or words, writing, or drawing; and high-tech apps on tablets or specialized speech-generating devices. The choice of AAC depends on the child's needs, preferences, and abilities. Choices may vary frequently over time. More than one type of AAC is usually required to ensure that the child can always communicate. An AAC tool or tools are identified during an assessment with an experienced SLP. An SLP can help find ways to fund a device and many states have technology centers that can be a great resource for equipment. How do I help my child get started with AAC? As a parent or caregiver, you don't need to figure this out on your own! Speech-language pathologists are educated to help. The process may seem overwhelming, but these professionals will work with you and your pediatrician to help find an appropriate communication option or options. Here is how SLPs can assist:\t Assessment and individualized intervention:  An SLP will evaluate the specific communication needs of your child and recommend an AAC system/s that is appropriate for the child's abilities and preferences. They will work with other professionals including occupational therapists, physical therapists, or vision specialists to make sure that any accessories or equipment are tailored to any other sensory and physical needs the child has. SLPs will work with insurance companies, vendors, or local technology centers to help pay for technology as needed and help to complete any required paperwork. \t Training and support:  SLPs provide technology and communication training to important people in a child's life (family members, caregivers, teachers, support personnel) to help make sure AAC use is successful. They can show you how to operate, clean, store, and charge AAC equipment; demonstrate effective ways to use AAC; provide ideas for practice; and coach you on how to integrate AAC in all the places in a child's life (home, daycare, school, etc.). The SLP will develop goals with the family and provide communication intervention for your child to help them develop their speech and language with the aid of AAC. You will be an active participant in the learning process! \t Ongoing progress monitoring:  An SLP will regularly monitor your child's communication development and make necessary recommendations to support communication needs as your child grows into a teenager, college student, and adult. Your knowledge and input will continue to be crucial to making goals to match your child's needs.  You can find an SLP by asking your pediatrician for a recommendation, or by contacting your local early intervention program or school system. A database of private providers is also available from the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) at    www.asha.org/profind . It's important to ask the SLP about their level of experience with AAC and to choose a professional you feel comfortable with and is a good match for your child and family.  Bottom line AAC is a powerful communication tool that can positively impact a child's life. Early access to AAC during later infancy and early toddler years can offer big benefits to a child's language development, social engagement, and overall well-being. Even if you haven't tried AAC before, your older child or teen may benefit from a comprehensive AAC evaluation. By working with an SLP to incorporate AAC, children and their families can improve and enrich their lives in every way.

        "content": "​​By: JoJo Yang, MD & Courtney J. Wusthoff MD, MS, FAAP Children with cerebral palsy have trouble controlling their movement. The condition is the most common disability that affects a child's motor control. Cerebral palsy usually is caused by a brain injury or abnormal brain development before birth or early in life. Genetic causes, although less common, can also play a role.  Here is what families need to know about cerebral palsy and how to help children who have it  reach their full potential . How does cerebral palsy affect children? Cerebral palsy can affect children in many ways. Some children who have cerebral palsy will learn to walk and run, but may do so a little later than other kids. Other children with cerebral palsy may need devices, such as a walker or leg braces to walk. Still others may use a wheelchair as their best way to move around. For some children, cerebral palsy makes it difficult to eat or talk, because it is hard for them to control the necessary movements. The type of cerebral palsy a child has is related to what parts of the brain developed abnormally or were injured early in life.  While cerebral palsy affects motor control, this is different than intelligence or other brain functions. A child may be very bright even though cerebral palsy makes it hard for them to control some movements. If your child is diagnosed with cerebral palsy, it is important to share their diagnosis with doctors, therapists and school staff. This will help your child get treatments and support to help them. What are some signs of cerebral palsy in children? The first clue a child might have cerebral palsy is usually      motor delay , such as learning to sit or to walk late. If a child has a known risk for cerebral palsy, special developmental check-ups are sometimes planned to watch for early concerning signs. Sometimes, a child's family or pediatrician might be the first to notice motor delay in a child. If you have any concerns about your child's development, talk to your pediatrician.\t Cerebral palsy can show up in a number of ways:\t Spasticity  is increased muscle tone. This is the abnormal tightness in a child's muscles. The tightness is there even when the muscles are resting. Spasticity can make arms stay tight and close to the body, or make legs stiff and difficult to bend.\t Hypotonia  is low muscle tone. This may appear as floppiness in the muscles. Children with hypotonia may have trouble sitting up or holding up their head. Hypotonia is different from muscle weakness, which is also common in some children with cerebral palsy. \t Diplegia  is trouble controlling both legs. In some cases, this may make walking difficult.\t Hemiplegia  is trouble moving one side of the body. Children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy may have trouble using their arm and leg on either the left or right side.\t Dystonia  is when muscles contract in an uncontrolled way. This can cause muscle spasms, involuntary movements, or \"getting stuck\". What causes cerebral palsy? Many children diagnosed with cerebral palsy may not have any known risk factors. There are different reasons a child may develop cerebral palsy, including:\t Premature birth.  Nearly half of people with cerebral palsy are born prematurely. This is the most common cause of cerebral palsy in the United States. However, children born at term may also develop cerebral palsy.\t Medical problems  during pregnancy or around the time a baby is born.\t Illnesses or injuries  as a newborn or infant, such as very severe jaundice, strokes, brain infections, and bleeding into brain structures.\t Genetic conditions.  Recent research suggests that underlying genetic abnormalities may be related to cerebral palsy.  For children with cerebral palsy, an MRI (magnetic resonance image) may be recommended to see if a brain injury is present. Other times, genetic testing may be helpful. Your pediatrician may work with a specialist, such as a developmental pediatrician or pediatric neurologist, to help families plan for these or other tests.  How is cerebral palsy treated? Cerebral palsy is a chronic, life-long medical problem. There is no cure that can make it go away completely, but there are ways to help a child with cerebral palsy do their best.  Physical and occupational therapy, medications, and assistive devices such as braces can help a child reach their best potential. Treatment supports the child's overall development, improves their functional ability to participate in family and community activities, and minimize complications. Talk to your pediatrician about different therapy options for your child with cerebral palsy. These may include:\t Early intervention.  Early intervention programs can help babies who are behind in their development. A team may include behavioral specialists, physical therapists, nurses, social workers, and early childhood educators. Early intervention programs may include feeding therapy as well, however the type of provider (speech language pathologist, occupational therapist), may vary depending on location. The team teaches families strategies and gives them tips to help their baby learn new skills. \t Physical therapy.  Physical therapists are specialists who work with children on stretching and strengthening exercises. They help a child learn new movements, such as rolling over, sitting, or walking.\t Occupational therapy.  These specialists help children learn to do day-to-day tasks. They use a combination of exercises, modifying items the child uses every day and figuring out ways to successfully work around challenges to the child's abilities.\t Speech therapy.  Speech therapists can help children with learning to talk and other ways to communicate.\t Assistive devices.  Different kinds of equipment may help children with cerebral palsy. Leg braces can support their legs as they learn to walk. Arm braces can support arms or hands in a more functional position. Other types of assistive devices include communication keyboards, special wheelchairs, and chairs to help with sitting.\t Medications &  medical interventions.  These may be recommended when therapies are not enough. They may include medicines to help with general muscle spasticity, or injections to relax particular muscles. This can help a child participate in therapies. In some situations, surgery may also be recommended as part of the child's treatment plan.  Because so many different causes may result in a diagnosis of cerebral palsy, different children may benefit from different treatments. It is important for parents to talk with their team about the benefits of different traditional and complementary treatments, their frequency, and models of care. Keeping kids with cerebral palsy healthy Your pediatrician and care team will also help keep your child healthy by watching out for any medical problems that sometimes go along with cerebral palsy. Ongoing care can also help prevent complications.\t Routine preventive care.  Children with cerebral palsy should receive the same routine preventive care that all children receive, including immunizations, hearing/vision screening, etc. \t Specific problems associated with cerebral palsy.  Every child is different. For some children with cerebral palsy, extra check-ups may be needed to look out for problems that can happen along with cerebral palsy. These may include learning problems, seizures/epilepsy, vision difficulties, hearing loss and feeding difficulties. Your pediatrician will help you make a plan for your child.\t Minimizing joint and bone complications.  Children who do not move much, especially who spend a lot of time in the same position, may develop \"contractures.\" This is when the joints become limited in how much they can move. Stretching can help prevent contractures. Children who do not stand or walk also are at risk of having low bone density (osteopenia) and scoliosis (too much curving of the spine). Your pediatrician and other care team members will help watch for any early problems and help with plans to avoid or treat these complications.\t Oral hygiene.  As with any other child, dental hygiene is very important. Patients with cerebral palsy might be at higher risk of poor oral hygiene due to oral aversion. This is particularly important in patients with a feeding tube as they are at increased risk for cavities. Make sure to discuss these topics with your child's Pediatrician to ensure he/she is receiving appropriate dental care.\t Reproductive health.  Youth with cerebral palsy, like all youth, have the right to  healthy sexuality​ . Children with cerebral palsy are at greater risk for early or late onset puberty, so engaging in early conversations with your pediatrician about puberty and sexuality are encouraged.            Remember Like all children, kids with cerebral palsy live in dynamic communities and require a combination of medical, environmental and social supports to thrive. Talk to your pediatrician about your child's diagnosis and its impact on the child's function, family, fitness, fun, friends and future.

        "content": "Down syndrome is a common condition caused by having \"extra\" copies of genes on the 21st chromosome. Those extra genes change    development during pregnancy  and continue to have effects after birth and throughout a person's life. Each person with Down syndrome is unique, having some of the many possible health, learning and related differences that can occur with this condition. Treatments for children with Down syndrome  Some of the differences in people with Down syndrome are common and visible, like facial appearance. Other changes are less common or less visible but can still cause problems or may need special treatments. The \"special treatments\" may include medicines, surgeries, or changes in what you should expect. There are no medicines or therapies that are needed by all people with Down syndrome. There are also no medicines or therapies that can \"cure\" Down syndrome. Your child's doctor should be your starting point. Your child needs regular doctor visits and a few special tests.    Pediatric specialists  may also need to be involved. AAP guide for families of children with Down syndrome The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has developed a special guide to help parents and families of children with Down syndrome. It focuses on medical topics that affect physical health. Other issues can affect social and school success. While these issues may not require doctors or other medical resources, they are still important issues for children with Down syndrome.\t Click here to download the complete guide, \"Health Care Information for Families of Children with Down Syndrome\" (PDF).\t The medical issues for a child with Down syndrome change with age.

Some tests or pediatric specialists might be needed that are not available in your area. Your doctor can help to sort out the best next steps when something can't be done quickly or nearby. Parent support groups Local parent support groups can be a very good place to learn about doctors, therapists, and other providers in your community. They may also be able to help with questions about child care, preschools and schools, other local developmental programs, problems with behavior, etc. Your doctor's office should have names and contact information for groups in your area.

        "content": "About 3% to 4% of all babies born in the United States have congenital abnormalities that will affect the way they look, develop, or function—in some cases for the rest of their lives.  Congenital abnormalities are caused by problems during the fetus's development before birth. It is important for moms and dads to be healthy and have good medical care before and during pregnancy to reduce the risk of preventable congenital anomalies.  Advances in perinatal testing and  new diagnostic tests  (i.e. amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, etc.) have made it possible to detect chromosomal and genetic related causes of congenital abnormalities earlier.  5 Categories of Congenital Abnormalities  Chromosome Abnormalities Chromosomes are structures that carry genetic material inherited from one generation to the next. Twenty-three come from the father; twenty-three come from the mother. The genes carried on the chromosomes determine how the baby will grow, what she will look like, and to a certain extent, how she will function. When a child is born without 46 chromosomes , or when pieces of the chromosomes are missing or duplicated, she may look and behave differently from others her age and may develop serious health problems (e.g.  Down syndrome ).  Single-Gene Abnormalities Sometimes the chromosomes are normal in number, but one or more of the genes on them are abnormal.  Autosomal dominant inheritance  is a genetic abnormality that can be passed on to the child if  one  of the parents has the same abnormality.  Autosomal recessive inheritance  is a genetic abnormality that can be passed on to the child only if  both  parents carry the same defective gene (e.g.  Cystic fibrosis , Tay-Sachs disease, sickle cell anemia). In these cases, both parents are normal, but 1 in 4 of their children would be expected to be affected.  X-linked conditions  are genetic abnormalities that mainly occur in males (e.g. hemophilia, color blindness, forms of muscular dystrophy). Females may carry the abnormal gene that causes X-linked recessive disorders, but they may not show the actual disease.  X-linked dominant conditions  occur in both males and females; however, they are more severe in males (e.g. certain neurological conditions affecting the brain, skin disorders and types of skeletal or craniofacial disorders).  Conditions During Pregnancy That Affect The Baby Certain illnesses  during pregnancy, particularly during the first nine weeks, can cause serious congenital abnormalities (e.g. maternal infections such as cytomegalovirus,  chicken pox  or  rubella ).  Chronic maternal conditions  (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, autoimmune diseases such as lupus, myasthenia gravis or graves disease)  can negatively affect the developing fetus. Maternal hypertension can affect blood flow to the fetus impair fetal growth. Alcohol consumption  and certain drugs during pregnancy significantly increase the risk that a baby will be born with abnormalities (e.g.  fetal alcohol spectrum disorders ).  Eating  raw  or uncooked foods  during pregnancy can also be dangerous to health of the mother and fetus and should be avoided. Certain medications , if taken during pregnancy, also can cause permanent damage to the fetus, as can certain chemicals that can pollute air, water, and food. Always check with your doctor before using any medication or supplement while you are pregnant.  Combination of Genetic and Environmental Problems Some congenital abnormalities may occur if there is a genetic tendency for the condition combined with exposure to certain environmental influences within the womb during critical stages of the pregnancy (e.g.  Spina bifida  and cleft lip and palate).   Taking folate supplements prior to conception and during pregnancy decreases the risk of neural tube defects. However, there is also a genetic influence to this type of congenital anomaly. Unknown Causes The vast majority of congenital abnormalities have no known cause. This is particularly troubling for parents who plan to have more children, because there is no way to predict if the problem will reoccur.  If Your Family Has Experienced a Genetic-Related Birth Abnormality Ask your pediatrician for a referral to a  genetic counseling service . These services have expertise with a variety of genetic abnormalities and may be able to advise you as to the proper course of action.

        "content": "By: Alexandra Santana Almansa, MD & Jilda N. Vargus-Adams, MD, MSc, FAAP As the parent of a young person living with cerebral palsy (CP), you play a daily role in their care and support. Helping them look ahead to adulthood becomes even more important as they move into their teen years. In fact, medical caregivers specializing in CP suggest that families begin planning this transition when their child is around 12 to 14 years old.  Since cerebral palsy affects each person's functioning in a unique way, the plans you make will ultimately depend on your child's abilities and goals. The years ahead may bring waves of change as they explore new possibilities for ongoing study, work and independent living. At age 18, they will officially become adults in the eyes of the medical system—which means it's time to make the transition to a medical team that will support their health over the longer term. \t    How cerebral palsy can affect adult health  Many people with cerebral palsy adapt to the physical and mental challenges of their condition and enjoy relatively good health. However, CP does create ongoing issues with muscle tone, strength and motor control. It also poses specific health risks at all ages.  Nearly half of all people with CP experience chronic pain.  Around one in 10 have serious vision problems.  Depression risks are 3 to 4 times higher for people with disabilities, including CP.  Most adults with CP age prematurely due to the extra stress and strain on their bodies. This can lead to higher risks for heart and lung disease.  Fatigue is a common issue, because people with CP may use 3 to 5 times more energy than able-bodied people when they walk and move.  Bone and joint problems can lead to arthritis.  Dental health may suffer, since many people with CP have difficulty with the small-motor movements involved in brushing and flossing their teeth. The right health care team will have experience with these and other health issues common to adults with cerebral palsy. They will monitor your child's health and identify potential issues early, recommending treatments and therapies to ease discomfort and improve quality of life. Team members can also provide care related to your child's sexual and reproductive health.    Creating an adult medical team takes time & care Teens with cerebral palsy may have been working with the same doctors and therapists since they were small. In fact, the members of this care team may feel like mentors and friends who have helped you and your child in countless ways. Part of making the transition to adult care is taking time to build new relationships with medical caregivers who will see your adult child's unique needs and help them thrive. Your child's new care team may include specialists in neurology, gastroenterology, orthopedics, rehabilitation medicine and other fields. Your child will need a true    medical home  where providers work collaboratively to see and treat the whole person. Planning your teen's medical transition, step-by-step Families and teens can work together in shaping the transition from childhood (pediatric) providers to adult providers. The planning process should:  Set a specific age for transferring from pediatric to adult care. Discussions about medical transition to adult care ideally should start between 12 and 14 years of age.  In partnership with your child's doctor, create a clear summary of the child's medical history to date with a list of current caregivers, medications and supplies  Outline possible sources of medical insurance coverage after age 18  List home-based and community-based services the child can apply for (and the timeline to apply)    Part of the conversation will be the level of decision-making support your child will need after transitioning to adult care. They may want to manage their own medical needs independently of you, while being able to ask for support when they need it. Or they may want you to play a more active role, helping with details like scheduling, insurance claims and record-keeping.    Children who live with serious physical or intellectual disabilities may need the comprehensive support of a guardianship. Beginning the planning process early gives you time to explore these options and look for the providers and services needed when your child reaches transition age.    Supporting your child's journey to adulthood Working on your teen's medical transition plan together can foster healthy self-management. Being part of the decision-making team can help them think about opportunities for ongoing education, independent living and the new relationships they will enjoy as adults. Having a transition plan can also be helpful in communicating with your current medical team. You can revisit the plan during medical visits and set specific goals to move your teen and family forward. When the time is right, your child's current medical providers can exchange information with their adult providers. You and your teen can review this information ahead of time and provide any input that will help the adult care team understand specific concerns and needs. Bringing it all together: some questions for the road ahead As you and your teen begin planning their medical transition, other essential questions may come up. For example:  Do they want to continue their education beyond high school? What work and career plans are they considering? Where would they feel most comfortable and safe living?  How do they see their social and family life evolving? This is a great time to explore ways you can help them build self-sufficiency skills. For teens who want to live on their own someday, it's never too early to begin talking about the basics of personal finance, work-life balance and other issues. Starting in early adolescence will give you the time and energy to explore these topics as they come up, creating a long-term conversation that benefits all of you. If your teen's level of functioning points to the need for guardianship and income support, starting early will give you time to find the legal and financial professionals who can help you put the necessary agreements in place. Advance planning is a gift to you and your teen, since it reduces stress and assures they will be well cared for in the future.

        "content": "By: Rajapillai Pillai, MD, PhD &  Jacqueline M. Branch, MD, FAAP As a parent, you know your child best. If you have concerns about how your child talks, acts, moves, plays or learns, don't wait to raise them. Acting early can make a huge difference in your child's success in school and life.  What is early intervention? For babies and young children, this may mean getting    early intervention  services and supports for developmental delays or disabilities. Starting at age 3, a child's developmental services transition from early intervention to the school system. This process can feel overwhelming, especially for children with    special health care needs  and developmental disabilities.  Sometimes, we discover that a child needs services and support after they start school. Parents and caregivers have a lot of influence. You can advocate for your child and help them get the support they need. We hope that the following information will help make the process easier. What's the difference between an IEP and a 504 plan? The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires that all individuals can obtain a free and appropriate education. The Individualized Education Program (IEP) and 504 plan help ensure that all children are able to receive this, regardless of physical or mental disability.\t An IEP is a formal plan that involves specialized instruction, supportive services and measurable goals.  These goals are reviewed on a yearly basis, and regular progress reports are required. For example, specialized instruction may include a smaller classroom size or classroom accommodations. Supportive services may include speech/language therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, specialized transportation or mental health counseling.\t A 504 plan provides educational accommodations to students who have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity such as eating, sleeping, standing, lifting, concentrating or communicating.  This does not necessarily include regular progress reports or reviews of goals. But a 504 plan may include increased time on exams, breaks during physical education, reduced length of assignments or unlimited bathroom access. Basically, the purpose of a 504 plan is to remove barriers to learning and ensure equal access for all students in school. Know Your Support Structures: IEPs and 504 Plans Explained\t  \t Individualized Education Program (IEP)\t \t \t 504 Plan Requires measured annual goals with progress reports. Yes No\t Must include post-secondary transition services. Yes No Requires the child to fit one of 13 categories of conditions requiring extra support. Yes No Has formal, measurable goals. Yes No\t Requires accommodations to assist free appropriate public education.\t Yes\t Yes\t Requires the school to address health needs of children at risk for severe disease (including severe COVID).\t Yes\t Yes\t Can incorporate a health plan to help prevent transmission of disease to vulnerable children (e.g., sanitizing equipment, avoiding shared toys or tools).\t Yes\t Yes For children who need special support but not necessarily specialized instruction. No Yes Requires the child to have a record of a physical or mental impairment substantially limiting one or more major life activities. No Yes\t Provides accommodations beyond kindergarten through 12th-grade education at the post-secondary level.  No Yes Every child who receives    special education  services must have a written document known as an IEP. It outlines your child's goals, education, services and other resources that the school district will provide. Special education: how your pediatrician can help your child get services they need Parents who feel their child might benefit from special education services should request an IEP evaluation in writing. Your pediatrician can help draft a letter of this request. Parents should work with personnel from their child's early intervention program to help with this transition. You can begin this process when your child turns 2 years old. The IEP is written after a formal evaluation by the school. During the evaluation, current performance levels are established and documented. To be eligible for special education services, your child must meet the criteria for one of 13 eligibility categories, and the disability must adversely affect their educational performance. Every IEP should have several key pieces of information, including: Your child's current levels of performance Measurable goals for the school year When reports about your child's progress will be provided How well your child is able to function in school How your child will be included with peers with typical development How your child will be assessed on statewide and district-wide tests The IEP should include dates when services will begin, locations and how long they will last. The IEP should also discuss what will be done when your child's needs change. It also may outline whether your child gets related services, such as special transportation,    speech therapy ,    occupational therapy  or counseling. If your child also qualifies for services when school is not in session, the IEP should include which interventions they will receive. The IEP is written by a team made up of: the child's parents regular education teacher special education teacher psychologists therapists school administrator other school personnel The First IEP or 504 meeting: tips for parents The first IEP or 504 Plan meeting can be an emotional time for parents and school staff. Before the meeting, look over education laws and what interventions may be offered based on your child's needs. A meeting to discuss the IEP must be held within 30 days after a school determines that a child needs special education services. Parents may invite anyone to this meeting, including personnel such as an advocate or the child's case manager from the early intervention program. The IEP is evaluated at least every year to determine whether goals are being met and may be adjusted if your child's needs change. What if your child's IEP or 504 plan isn't working? Regular progress reviews are required as part of a child's IEP. If you feel that their plan is not working, a good first step is often to speak to their teacher and support staff directly to make sure all parts of the IEP are being followed appropriately. You also have the right to request a formal meeting to review their IEP. A 504 plan does not provide the same process to formally review a child's progress. But many of the same steps can be taken. Parents and caregivers can discuss their child's education and behavior with their teachers, therapists, school nurse and 504 coordinator. You can also request a meeting, though the school is not legally required to convene as they are for an IEP. Your child's pediatrician is another good resource to ask for advice or to write a letter of support. The pediatrician does not decide what accommodations a child receives. But their input can help give the IEP or 504 team a better understanding of your child's condition. How to request or adjust an IEP or 504 Plan To request services: Find out who your school's IEP or 504 coordinator is. Submit a formal written request to the coordinator. Be specific about your concerns! Include any documentation that may support your child's needs and include the date. You may need to follow up on this request. Discuss with your pediatrician for advice and specific recommendations. Pediatricians can help advocate for the needs of your child, including a letter of support in certain cases, though the plan will ultimately be at the discretion of the school.  To adjust an IEP or 504 Plan: First, discuss with your child's teacher to make sure the plan is being followed. For an IEP, you can bring up your concerns and request a change when reviewing the plan's goals. Or submit a formal request asking for a re-evaluation or change in plan. Again, be specific! For a 504 Plan you can also request a meeting with your child's teacher or 504 coordinator or request a team meeting, though the school is not required to meet as they are with an IEP. Remember The process of advocating for your child to obtain and maintain an IEP or a 504 plan can feel stressful or even scary. But there are many supports and useful resources to help parents navigate the process. If you feel overwhelmed, a friend, another parent or your pediatrician or another health care professional can be a good source of perspective and advice. You are not alone in this process.

        "content": "By: Richard C. Adams, MD, FAAP & Susan E. Levy, MD, MPH, FAAP Treatment should never be a process done to your child. Rather, decisions about care should be implemented with your child's input—as much as possible—with support, guidance, and assistance from you and other care team members.  The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) clinical report,   \t Shared Decision-Making and Children with Disabilities: Pathways to Consensus , states that children, when cognitively able, should be involved in decisions about their care. Parents and professionals too often look to this process for \"the big decisions,\" however smaller decisions can have a significant impact over time.\t   Presenting children with information—appropriate for their developmental age—can help in their understanding of their condition and treatments, reduce fear and enhance self-confidence. Shared Decision-Making Tips for Parents of Children with Disabilities: \t Educate your child about his or her condition . Find out what your child understands and/or wants to know. Work with your child's doctors and others in your community to identify books, videos, websites, and other resources to help your child learn about his or her condition. \t Identify future goals . Have a discussion with your family and your child's doctors. Start picking out goals for your child's future—short-term (e.g., within the year) and long-term (e.g., as an adult).\t Have quick check-ins with your child . Once you have identified the goals for your child and their priority, make sure he or she understands them as fully as possible given his or her level of understanding—especially if things don't make sense or just don't feel right.\t Have your child present . Your child should be present whenever possible for at least part of meetings concerning his or her condition or treatment. Parts of the discussion should address your child directly at his or her level of understanding.\t Consider who else should be present . Some decisions are relatively straightforward (e.g., antibiotics for strep throat) and may not require long or difficult discussions, but others (e.g., starting a psychotropic medication for behavior) may be tougher. In addition to having your child present for these decisions—if he or she is able—it is also a good idea to have another family member(s) there. For example, grandparents, siblings, or child care providers involved in day-to-day care may have input and even act as a scribe in the meeting. Sometimes, it can be difficult to hear and process information correctly after the fact. The other family member there can help recall the conversation later and clarify for questions.\t Ask about breaking up appointments . Sometimes, it can be helpful to separate long, complex discussions into shorter, topic-based meetings. This also gives everyone—including the doctors and other professionals—more time to prepare. Having a set time limit for the discussion can be helpful, as well. \t Be aware that this is a \"process.\"  There are situations where a \"yes\" or \"no\" decision is needed immediately. Considering data, reflecting on choices, and coming to a consensus can be accomplished either quickly (if needed) or within a longer timeframe if shared decision-making techniques are used regularly. \t Know teens need time alone with the doctor . Adolescents may benefit from time alone with their doctor(s) or other health professionals without parents present. The shared decision-making process allows for more input from your child. Ask your child about what he or she would like to talk about and arrange a separate meeting if he or she would like one. \t Realize participation prepares your child for adulthood . Your child's prioritizing of his or her condition-related problems should be taken seriously. Teach your child to consider his or her strengths, obstacles, and abilities to function in different situations and to monitor any changes. It's never too early to start talking about these topics. Ask your child's doctors for more ideas on how to include your child in this process, as well as any additional resources.  About Crisis & Emergency Situations: Shared decision-making should be implemented for routine decisions and well in advance of predictable (or unpredictable) crises, such as those requiring intensive care or do-not-resuscitate decisions. Complex or serious decisions are often easier to make if a foundation of trust was already built through prior experiences in the shared decision-making process.  Crisis and    emergency medical situations  can also change the process to accomplish shared decision-making. Components of shared decision-making can and should be used if possible, but the AAP report acknowledges that it may not always possible or allowed in an    acute  or serious emergency.

        "content": "​By: Eliza Gordon-Lipkin, MD, FAAP  Leukodystrophies are a group of genetic diseases that affect the white matter in the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). White matter is tissue that contains nerve fibers, or axons. The protective covering around these nerve fibers is called myelin. Myelin helps the nerves throughout your body communicate with each other.  When you have a leukodystrophy, there are abnormalities in the white matter in your central nervous system. This damages the myelin, disrupting communication between your brain and your body.  Leukodystrophies are rare. Altogether, they occur in about 1 of 4700 live births. A leukodystrophy can show up at any time from birth to late adulthood, but they are more common in children. Most leukodystrophies are progressive, which means they get worse and cause more damage as time goes on.  Types of leukodystrophies Right now, there are more than 50 different conditions that are considered to be leukodystrophies.  Some of the specific types of leukodystrophy include:  Alexander disease Canavan disease Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis  (CTX)  Krabbe disease​ Metachromatic leukodystrophy  (MLD) Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease  (PMD) Refsum disease Vanishing white matter disease  (also known as childhood ataxia with central nervous system hypomyelination) X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy  (ALD) Signs & symptoms of leukodystrophies In some leukodystrophies, symptoms may start soon after birth or may even be detected prenatally. In others, they may not show up until later childhood or even adulthood.  Each type of leukodystrophy affects different parts of the brain, so the symptoms can vary widely. This means that symptoms depend on which type of leukodystrophy your child has, how old they are, and how much the disease has progressed.  In general, symptoms in infants may include:  Developmental delay  or developmental regression (loss of previously achieved milestones) Seizures​ Abnormal eye movements Abnormal head growth (microcephaly or macrocphaly)  In children, adolescents, and adults, symptoms may include:  Developmental delay or regression (loss of previously achieved milestones) Seizures Changes in behavior Cognitive problems, including problems with attention Vision changes Balance or coordination problems  What causes leukodystrophies? Leukodystrophies happen because of a mutation in one of the genes that affects how myelin works or grows. Frequently, this mutation is inherited from one or both parents. However, sometimes leukodystrophy is caused by a spontaneous mutation that is not inherited.  As a parent, you can have a genetic mutation that's associated with a leukodystrophy, yet not ever develop the disease yourself. But, since you have the mutated gene, you may pass it on to your children. This means you're what's called a carrier. How are leukodystrophies diagnosed? Leukodystrophies can be hard to diagnose and the process may sometimes take a long time. Getting diagnosed as soon as possible is important though because treatment can help. In some types of leukodystrophy, treatment may even be able to prevent further damage.  Many states include some leukodystrophies in newborn screenings. You can check with your child's pediatrician to find out which screenings your child has had.  If your child has symptoms of a leukodystrophy, they may have tests to help diagnose it or to rule out other conditions. These tests may include:  Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) to look at your child's brain and spinal cord Genetic testing Tests to see how your child's muscles and the nerves that control them are working Tests that check for hearing and vision loss Other blood tests Treatment for leukodystrophies Leukodystrophies are progressive, meaning they usually get worse with time. Your child's prognosis will depend on what type of leukodystrophy they have. Leukodystrophy has no cure. Your medical team will work to treat your child's symptoms. Depending on which type of leukodystrophy your child has, some of the treatments they might have include:  Anti-epileptic medications to prevent seizures  Medication to help with tight muscles and movement issues Physical, occupational, and/or speech therapy to improve mobility, speaking, and balance Nutritional therapy to help with eating and swallowing difficulties  Stem cell or bone marrow transplantation may help improve certain types of leukodystrophy.  If it's diagnosed early, one type of leukodystrophy called CTX can be treated with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) replacement therapy.  Researchers are    conducting trials  to study new treatment options such as gene therapy, enzyme replacement, and certain medications.

        "content": "By: Laura Cornwell, MD  Children with neurocognitive disorders such as    cerebral palsy , who have differences in brain and nerve function, sometimes also experience other body function differences. This may include difficulty with urination control, also called voiding dysfunction. Read more about this connection and tips that can help manage toileting challenges.  What is voiding dysfunction?   \" Voiding dysfunction \" means urination problems that continue after a child has been    toilet-trained  for 6 or more months. Voiding dysfunction is common in    all  children: including as many as    20% of school-age children .  Common symptoms of voiding dysfunction include: Daytime   urine leakage or accidents Nighttime urine leakage or accidents ( nocturnal enuresis  or bedwetting)   Continued need for diaper   Stool (poop) accidents Frequency: Needing to pee often, more than once every 2 hours Urgency: Needing to pee urgently, or having sudden need to urinate without much warning Difficulty starting to pee and maintaining a urinary stream Feeling of incomplete urine emptying Why are children with neurocognitive disorders more likely to have voiding dysfunction? The bladder is a muscle in the body meant to hold urine, and the  sphincter  is a muscle that controls the exit of urine. These muscles must work together for urine to be stored and emptied. Many patients with a neurocognitive disorder have different muscle movement of one or both muscles.  It is common for children with neurocognitive abnormalities to have voiding dysfunction challenges that can last many years. However, there are common conditions that can also contribute to bladder control symptoms. How UTIs can affect voiding dysfunction Urinary tract infections  (UTIs) can worsen voiding dysfunction. UTIs are usually more common in children with more severe neurological diseases, including those who are unable to walk or speak. The constipation connection It's also important to know that  constipation  can worsen voiding dysfunction in  all  children. Even when kids seem to have regular bowel movements without difficulty or pain, they can have hard or large stools sitting in their gut that push on the bladder and make urinary symptoms worse. Constipation is very common in children with neurocognitive abnormalities, so regular attention to bowel movements is very important to help urination issues. What can I do to improve voiding dysfunction in my child with a neurocognitive abnormality? Some children may have less common or bothersome symptoms, while others may cause them daily bother and stress. For some children, symptoms may improve as they grow and mature, while for others with more significant neurological differences symptoms may worsen over time. Many voiding dysfunction symptoms can be improved with changes in toileting habits, such as: Managing constipation One reliable strategy to help voiding dysfunction is to pay closer attention to bowel movements.  The bladder works best if the intestine, located right next to it, is passing soft stools at least daily. Ideal stool should have only slight form, similar to mashed potatoes or soft serve ice cream. Stools that are more solid, have cracks or chunks often take longer to leave the body and push against the bladder in a way that can cause voiding dysfunction. Constipation is also one of the most common causes for UTIs in children. Simple diet changes and over-the-counter medications can help bowel movements.  Changes in diet:  The best things to eat and drink to help bowel movements are water, vegetables and beans with fiber. Prunes and flaxseed oil are popular natural laxatives for families. Other \"P\" fruits can also help help stools- including peaches, pears, pineapples. Important foods to    stay away from  include fresh (bright yellow) bananas or frequent cow's milk. Many children who have voiding dysfunction are also at an age where  picky eating  is common, making diet changes hard for parents. When dietary changes do not create regular, soft stool as described above, medications are often needed. Constipation medication:  The most commonly recommended medication for children with constipation is polyethylene glycol powder, which is available over-the-counter. This medicine is preferred because it stays inside the intestines, gently pulls water to make stool looser, and should not cause cramps or pain. It can be mixed into water, any liquid, or pudding/cream-like foods. The correct amount can be different for each child depending on their size. The amount given can be increased or decreased for soft stool, which will usually occur around 24 hours after given.  Many other over-the-counter medications are also available for children to assist with bowel movements if needed. Talk with your child's pediatrician about different options. Sometimes a    gastroenterology  consultation can help, especially if over-the-counter medicines do not seem to be helpful. Reward systems & other toileting techniques for voiding dysfunction If your child can follow directions, you can make goals with them on how to help their urine control. A reward system and words of encouragement can be very helpful! Punishment should be avoided. Common strategies include:\t Timed urination.  Set a timer or reminder to ask your child to urinate every 2-3 hours. This is to prevent accidents or urinary urgency from waiting too long between bathroom visits\t Double urinating . When your child urinates, have them go again after waiting 1-2 minutes to ensure better emptying.\t Relaxation techniques . When your child is at the toilet, ensure they look relaxed and are not rushing their urination. Legs should be apart and if possible, flat on a stool or the ground. Elbows can rest on the top of the legs and deep breathing can help get urine out. Boys should be asked to sit to help urinate better until their urination issues improve. When these approaches do not seem to help There are other therapies or medications a  pediatric urology care provider  may recommend to help symptoms. Your   pediatrician is a great place to start if you are ready to pursue new options for your child.   If your child is not able to follow directions For children who are the most disabled, they often remain in diapers. The main strategy for children who are diaper-dependent is regular hygiene to prevent rashes or wounds from wetness. Usually, there is low chance for urine-related complications like organ injury or infections.  Children who require regular use of a wheelchair may be more likely to have kidney stones, difficulty emptying their urine, or    urinary tract infections . If these occur, you will need to meet with a    pediatric urologist  to lower the chance of complications. What to do if your child is having difficulty peeing or holds in urine for long periods.  \" Urinary retention\"  is when there is difficulty starting a urine stream despite the bladder being full. In children with a neurocognitive abnormality, parents will see no wet diaper or urination for 8 hours or more. This can be due to multiple causes. Common causes of urinary retention  One common reason for urinary retention to happen is if your child has a large amount of    stool next  to the bladder. Other common causes are genital discomfort or some medications (most commonly seizure medications or muscle relaxers). How to help your child when they have trouble peeing If your child is having difficulty urinating, you may want to try to place your child's bottom in a tub of warm water for 10 or more minutes. If this is unsuccessful, a rectal suppository or enema (over-the-counter) can help a child pass a large stool and urine at the same time. If your child is uncomfortable or seems sick, they should be evaluated emergently, preferably in an urgent or emergent care setting. Remember\t Pediatric urologists  and their partner nursing providers are experts in the management of voiding dysfunction in all children. This is a common problem faced by many children and parents;   \t you are not alone ! If you are interested in getting one-on-one advice and treatment for your child, help is available. Ask your pediatrician, neurologist, or physiatrist about your child's symptoms and whether or not they may benefit from a referral.

        "content": "Sensory integration is a term that has been used to describe processes in the brain that allow us to take information we receive from our 5 senses, organize it, and respond appropriately. We also have a vestibular sense (balance) that tells us how to position our bodies and heads, and a proprioceptive sense (awareness of body in space) that helps us know what we do with our joints, muscles, and ligaments.  Sensory Processing Deficits and Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) In children who have  ASDs , sensory processing deficits have been theorized to cause difficulties that affect behavior and life skills. As a result, some children may be hypersensitive or hyposensitive to stimuli in the surroundings. Loud music, for instance, may cause intense discomfort, while bright fluorescent lights that bother others may be riveting to some children with ASDs. Children with sensory processing deficits may have difficulty with motor skills, balance, and eye-hand coordination.  Some children will look for ways to seek out certain sensations and engage in self-stimulating behaviors like rocking back and forth, head banging, and oral exploration of nonedible objects. What is Sensory Integration Therapy? Sensory integration therapy, which was developed in the 1970s by an OT, A. Jean Ayres, is designed to help children with sensory-processing problems (including possibly those with ASDs) cope with the difficulties they have processing sensory input. Therapy sessions are play-oriented and may include using equipment such as swings,  trampolines , and slides. Sensory integration also uses therapies such as deep pressure, brushing, weighted vests, and swinging. These therapies appear to sometimes be able to calm an anxious child. In addition, sensory integration therapy is believed to increase a child’s threshold for tolerating sensory-rich environments, make transitions less disturbing, and reinforce positive behaviors. Effectiveness of Sensory Integration Therapy  Although there are scientific studies to show that children with ASDs are more likely to have sensory-processing problems, the effectiveness of sensory integration therapy as a therapy for ASDs is limited and inconclusive. While this does not mean that the therapy might not be helpful in some children, effectiveness so far is mainly based on personal experiences.  Talk with your child’s pediatrician if you suspect that your child has difficulties with sensory processing; there may be resources in the community for further evaluation. Other Methods for Controlling Sensory Input  You may also learn about auditory integration training or behavioral optometry as methods for controlling sensory input. Both treatments aim to alter the child’s response to sensory stimuli, but neither method has proved to be scientifically valid. Also, there is no evidence that any problems seen with ASDs are related to these auditory or visual problems.

        "content": "​​Language development varies widely among children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Some are early talkers and never seem to run out of things to say. Others are naturally quiet and start speaking much later. However, social communication differences are core features of ASD. Many children with ASD will benefit from some form of speech- language therapy to enhance their communication skills.      What is social communication? Some children with ASD face have challenges in communicating their wants and needs. Others may unintentionally be one-sided in their conversations and benefit by working on 2-way communication. Teaching children with ASD to converse with others in social situations, also called pragmatic communication. Pragmatic language involves skills such as picking up on body language, maintaining eye contact, understanding implied meaning, using normal voice inflection and volume when speaking, maintaining the topic of conversation, and recognizing the interest level of others in what is being discussed. The extent of speech-language therapy varies from one child to the next and depends on the needs of the individual. The exact services your child requires are determined after evaluation by a speech-language pathologist, often called a speech-language therapist. Therapy itself may be done individually, in a small-group setting, or in a classroom. However, therapy is most effective when it involves everyone—teachers, support staff, families, and even the child's peers—to encourage the child to practice speech and language skills in a natural setting throughout the day. It's important to think of communication as being more than speech, especially because recent studies show that about 30% of individuals with ASD do not gain the skill of verbal speech.  Beyond verbal speech: augmentive communication Because some children with ASD become frustrated about not being able to verbally communicate their wants and needs, they may benefit from augmentative communication—using gestures, sign language, or picture communi­cation programs. For example, your child may benefit from the Picture Exchange Communication System, a method that uses ABA principles to teach children with less-developed verbal abilities to communicate with pictures.  With guidance from a therapist, teacher, or parent, the child learns how to exchange a picture for an object and eventually learns to use pictures to express thoughts and desires. Eventually, the child learns to create sentences using more than one picture and to answer questions. Introducing augmentative communication to children with ASD who are not yet using verbal communication does not keep them from learning to talk, and there is some evi­dence that they may be more stimulated to learn speech if they already understand something about symbolic communication. Augmentative communication may also include the use of electronic devices or applications, some of which have synthesized speech output.​",

In fact, it is the most common birth defect of the nervous system. About    1,400  babies are born with the condition in the United States each year. What is spina bifida? Spina bifida, which means \"split spine,\" is a    congenital abnormality  that occurs before birth. It happens when the embryo's neural tube--which later becomes the brain and spinal cord—does not close all the way. This can prevent bones along the spine from forming properly, too. In babies with spina bifida, part of the spinal column often bulges out on the back. The spinal cord and nerves also may be damaged. This can cause problems with movement, sensation and other body functions. Are there are different types of spina bifida? Yes, there are three major types of spina bifida:\t \t  Myelomeningocele:  This is the most common and severe type of spina bifida. Babies with this type have part of the spinal cord sticking out of the back.    (See \" From Surviving to Thriving With Spina Bifida ,\" below.)\t Meningocele:  In this type of spina bifida, a fluid-filled sack containing the structures that surround the spinal cord sticks out of the baby's back. The sack is sometimes covered by skin. In most cases, the spinal cord and nerves are normal or only mildly affected.\t Occulta:  This is sometimes called \"hidden spina bifida.\" There is no opening in the back. The spinal cord and nerves are usually normal and there is only a small abnormality in the bones of the spine. Some people may never have problems from spina bifida occulta and may not realize they have it. Some people will have a small patch of hair on the lower back. However, in some people, the condition can cause back pain, leg weakness or bowel and bladder problems. What causes spina bifida? As with other types of    neural tube defects  (NTDs), doctors don't yet understand all of the causes of spina bifida. Both genetics and the environment likely play a role. Here's what else we know: Parents of a child with spina bifida are at an increased risk of having a second child with a NTD. Certain medical conditions in pregnant women, like diabetes, are associated with increased risk of having babies born with NTDs. Some medications also increase the risk of NTDs when taken during pregnancy.\t Folic acid , a B vitamin, can help prevent NTDs when taken before and during pregnancy. Spina bifida occurs during the first few weeks of pregnancy, often before the parent knows they are pregnant.  That's why the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) supports the public health recommendation that all women who are able to become pregnant take 400 micrograms (mcg) per day of    folic acid . How do I know if my child has spina bifida?  Spina bifida may be diagnosed during pregnancy or after birth:\t During pregnancy ,    several screening tests  are done at regular prenatal visits that may identify a baby with spina bifida. These include a blood test, ultrasound and sometimes, amniocentesis, which tests the fluid that surrounds and protects a baby during pregnancy.\t After birth,  a newborn may be diagnosed with spina bifida when a doctor observes an abnormality somewhere along the spine. An ultrasound, x-ray, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computed tomography) scan may be used to get a clearer picture of the suspicious area. Are there treatments available for spina bifida?  Yes, treatments are available for spina bifida both before and after the baby is born. \t During pregnancy , prior to the birth of the baby: If spina bifida is identified during pregnancy, surgery on the baby may be performed in some patients. Many factors need to be considered when deciding whether or not a pregnant mother and baby should undergo this procedure. If eligible, the surgery should be done at a specialized hospital center experienced in fetal surgery.\t After birth:  For babies born with myelomingocele, surgery to close the back is usually recommended within the first two days of life. This surgery is necessary to prevent dangerous infections. However, the surgery does not reverse damage that may have already occurred to nerves of the spinal cord. Before and after surgery, babies with spina bifida are frequently cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). In addition to the care provided by a pediatrician, treatments for spina bifida requires a team of specialists.  Team members may include neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, urologists, rehabilitation experts, pediatric neurologists, developmental pediatricians, physical therapists, psychologists and social workers.  What other challenges can people with spina bifida have? \t Paralysis  (the loss of the ability to move). Because nerves leading to the lower part of the body can be damaged in children with spina bifida, the muscles in the legs may be very weak or paralyzed. Joints can also be very stiff. Many babies with this disorder are born with problems in the hips, knees and feet.    Surgery can help correct some of these problems. In addition, muscle weakness can be treated with physical therapy and special equipment such as braces and walkers. Many children with spina bifida eventually can stand and some can walk. The learning process is often long and challenging.\t Hydrocephalus  (\"water on the brain\"). Many children with spina bifida eventually develop this condition, caused by excess fluid around the brain. It occurs because the path where fluid usually flows is blocked in spina bifida. The higher up the abnormality is on the spine, the greater the risk is for hydrocephalus. This condition is serious and can be fatal. Pediatricians may suspect hydrocephalus if the baby's head is growing faster than expected. The condition is confirmed by a CT scan or MRI. It is often treated with surgery to place shunt that drains excess fluid.\t Chiari malformation.  In addition, most children with spina bifida have crowding of parts of their brain into the spinal canal. This malformation is referred to as Chiari malformation. It's frequently diagnosed by CT scan or MRI. Some patients with Chiari malformation require surgery to take pressure off of the brain tissue.\t Urinary tract & bowel problems.  Damage to the nerves that control the bladder are more likely to develop    urinary tract infections , which can damage the kidneys. Bowel control may also be a problem. Many medications or procedures can be used to treat these problems in people with spina bifida.\t Infections.  Children with spina bifida who also have hydrocephalus or urinary tract problems may be vulnerable to infection. Parents of children with these conditions need to watch carefully for signs of infection. Fortunately, the types of infections that can develop with these conditions usually can be treated effectively with antibiotics.\t Orthopedic problems.  Some orthopedic issues may be noted at birth but others may develop over time. Hip dislocation and scoliosis are common in children with spina bifida. Pediatricians, physical therapists and orthopedists work together to monitor for and treat these conditions and promote motor function.\t Latex allergy.  People with spina bifida have an increased risk of developing an allergy to latex. It is not known why. To help reduce a child's overall exposure to latex, parents can try to limit their baby's contact with products that contain latex (pacifiers, teething toys, changing pads, mattress covers, bandages and some diapers).\t Learning & social challenges.  Many children with spina bifida do well in school, although they may be more likely to have    developmental  and    learning disabilities  that can benefit from    special education . Many also need psychological counseling and    emotional support  to cope with their health, learning, and social challenges. Children with mobility problems may need support services through the school system, as well.\t Other concerns.  Some children with spina bifida may have problems with their    vision . Some may also have problems with sensation. In addition, about 10% to 15% of children with spina bifida also have    seizure  disorders (epilepsy). Sleep disordered breathing problems such as sleep apnea are also common.\t \t \t   From Surviving to Thriving With Spina Bifida \t By: Melanie Dragovits \t October 25 is World Spina Bifida Day. It is also the day that 18 years ago, I gave birth to our daughter, Elizabeth. Lizzy happens to have Spina Bifida. She was born with a Myelomeningocele near the two bottom vertebrae of her spine. The exposed spinal cord tissue on her lower back back was flat, covered with a thin membrane and shaped like a butterfly. Her very first surgery to close the open area of her spine happened immediately after delivery. It would be the first of many. Lizzy was also born with hydrocephalus and needed shunt surgery to drain excess fluid around her brain. In addition,    Chiari malformation  was causing crowding of her brain stem. Our rosy-cheeked baby soon looked pale and needed ventilator support and tube feeding. She underwent a very delicate and risky surgery to decompress the back of her brain and brain stem, intended to revive her drive to breathe and other vital life functions.  Lizzy was able to come off the ventilator. However, she still needed a tracheostomy, a surgically created hole in her windpipe, to treat her narrow airway and sleep apnea. Once Lizzy was able to come home, we enlisted a team of home physical therapists, occupational therapists and speech therapists. They were miracle workers. The baby we were warned may not live and, if she did, would not walk, talk, or eat, was eventually doing all of those things!\t   Lizzy has grown into a spunky, happy, wonderful young woman adored by many. Throughout her school years she has tried and conquered many goals: swimming, cheerleading, dancing, horseback riding, public speaking, volunteering, getting straight A's, being an active member and leader of high school clubs, acting in a play, learning to drive and more.  One of her most prized accomplishments has been becoming a counselor-in-training for her beloved    Camp Independence . She loves it because she gets to work with younger children who have spina bifida.   Today, Lizzy is a senior in high school with aspirations to be an early childhood educator specializing in special education. She has toured colleges and plans to attend a    transition program  offered by our state for those with physical disabilities before she goes away to college. The program helps teens develop the skills they need to transition to independent living.  Yes, Lizzy had a rocky and complex start to life. All that has happened shaped her into who she is today, and who I am. The experiences we shared on her journey with spina bifida has enriched our family in countless ways. We look forward to continuing to advocate and help others on their own personal spina bifida journey.\t Melanie Dragovits is a mother of three and an advocate for individuals with spina bifida. She is also an educator working in the field of special education. She sits on the Family Advisory Board for Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital's Spina Bifida Clinic in Chicago. Remember  Good medical care can greatly improve the quality of life for children with spina bifida and help them reach their full potential.

        "content": "Editor's note: Autism and ASD are used interchangeably in this article. If a screening or concern shows that a child is at risk for a developmental disorder, he should be referred to the state early intervention (EI) program. What is Early Intervention (EI)? The EI Program is a federal grant program run by individual states under Part C of the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  that works with children ages 0-3. Also called the \"Program for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities,\" EI targets children who show a delay in cognitive, social, or communication skills. These children may also have a delay in physical or motor abilities or self-care skills. Who Can Refer a Child to EI? Anyone can refer a child to EI, including: Pediatricians Parents Grandparents Child care providers The child does not even need a diagnosis. The EI program's team of specialists will test and evaluate the child to see if he qualifies for the program. Individualized Family Service Program (IFSP) If, after the initial evaluation, a child is eligible for the EI program, you will receive an Individualized Family Service Program (IFSP), which explains the services recommended for your child and how EI will help you and your family support your child. The IFSP will: Describe your child's current developmental levels Ways to improve your child's development Outcomes you can expect Outline the specific services that you and your family will receive Goal dates for starting and ending services In addition, the IFSP will provide information on how EI will help the child and family transition to school services when the child turns three. The IFSP should be developed with the family's values in mind and be supportive of the family's routine and priorities. EI Service Providers Service providers in an EI program include many types of professionals such as: Social workers Speech therapists Occupational therapists (Ots) Physical therapists (PTs)​ Registered dietitians Developmental therapists Psychologists Services may be provided in your home or in the community. Paying for EI Payment for EI services varies from state to state. Nevertheless, all states must provide at least some services free of charge. Experts agree that EI is an essential component in the early treatment of autism and other developmental problems. The program has shown to be beneficial to socially disadvantaged children who do not have an ASD and often leads to less need for  special education services  for those children later on. Early intervention also helps overall family function and improves outcomes for children who have a biologically based disorder such as an ASD. Additional Information You can get information about your state's EI program from your pediatrician, the state health department, or the local school district.

        "content": "​​​Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is one of the more common known causes of  intellectual disability  that can run in families (inherited). FXS is caused by a change in the genetic material in each cell of the body. This change in genetic material makes it hard for cells to produce a protein that is necessary for normal brain development and normal brain function. As an inherited condition, FXS can be passed on to the next generation. FXS Symptoms:   People with FXS may have some or all of the following symptoms:  Walking, talking, or  toilet training  later than other children of the same age  Problems with learning   Trouble making eye contact  Frequent  ear infections   Trouble sleeping  Seizures   Autism   Sensory difficulties (trouble with what a person sees, hears, smells, tastes, and touches) Currently there is no cure for FXS, but an early diagnosis can help a family get treatment and services for their child sooner, and having a diagnosis may provide valuable information for other family members. Myth Busters for Families: MYTH:  I thought my child was tested for FXS when I was pregnant or after my child was born? FACT:  FXS requires a special blood test that is not usually included in  the genetic tests that a pregnant woman gets  or in the tests done right after a baby is born. The only way to diagnose FXS is with a special blood test called the \"FMR1 DNA Test for Fragile X.\"  MYTH:  I thought girls couldn't have FXS, and boys always have severe symptoms. FACT:  Both boys and girls can have FXS. The symptoms are usually more severe in boys than in girls, but both boys and girls can have symptoms that range from mild to severe. MYTH:  Does everyone with FXS have large ears or a long, narrow face? FACT:  Many people with FXS do not have certain physical traits that textbooks attribute to FXS. However, some people with FXS do have some of these physical features. These features can be seen in younger children, but some may not show up until puberty. MYTH:  If there is no cure for FXS, why does my child need a diagnosis? FACT:  Even though there is no cure for FXS, there are educa­tional, behavioral, and therapeutic services which can help. A diagnosis may also help families with family planning and connecting with support groups of other families affected by FXS. MYTH:  How can my child have FXS? We don't have a family history of FXS.   FACT:  FXS is caused by a change in genetic material that ranges in size, and can become bigger from one generation to the next. Small size changes typically do not cause FXS, but large size changes often do cause FXS. Therefore, a person can have FXS without a family history if that person inherits a large change in the size of the genetic material while everyone else in the family has small size changes. Families who do not have FXS but have small size changes can have other signs that FXS could occur in future genera­tions. These families have members that may have fragile X-associated disorder symptoms, such as tremors and early menopause, which could be identified through a more thorough evaluation of  family history . What to Do If You Think Your Child Might Have FXS: Talk to your doctor about genetic testing if your child is not sitting, walking, or talking at the same time as other children the same age, has trouble learning new skills, or has social and behavioral problems like not making eye contact, anxiety, trouble paying attention, hand flapping, acting and speaking without thinking, and being very active.  Talk to your family to see if anyone remembers a history of \"Parkinson-like\" tremors in older men on the mother's side of the family, or a history of early menopause or fertility problems in women on the mother's side of the family. These are symptoms of fragile X-associated disorders, which suggest that FXS could run in the family. What to Do If Your Child Has Been Diagnosed with FXS: Early intervention services  in each state  help children from birth to 3 years old learn important skills. You can ask to have your child evaluated, and these services may improve your child's development. Even if your child has not been diagnosed with FXS, he or she may still be eligible for services.  Work with your child's pediatrician to get care and services for your child. Contact the organizations who work with FXS families and become familiar with FXS resources. Consider joining a local group of FXS families to share information and support each other.

        "content": "By: Catherine A. Fabian, MD & Kris R. Jatana, MD, FAAP, FACS A hit to the face during sports or other activities can leave a child with a sore—and sometimes broken—nose.  A broken nose or nasal injury can be scary for your child and you, especially if the nose is bleeding a lot or looks out of place. When this happens, it is important for your child to be seen by a medical professional. They can check for other injuries that may not be visible to you. This involves a thorough history and exam, focusing on the nasal trauma as well as possible injuries involving the eyes, head, facial bones or mouth. Will my child need an x-ray for a broken nose? Even if your child's nose is crooked, they may not need an x-ray or other imaging tests—as long as their nose is the only part of the face that hurts or is injured. Getting an x-ray for an isolated nose injury can be an unnecessary cost. It also exposes your child to radiation that might not change the treatment decisions made.  You and your doctor can discuss the pros and cons of the x-ray in your child's situation. This will help with the decision whether your child might benefit from an x-ray in your child's specific injury. When an imaging test may be recommended for nasal injury A computed tomography (CT) imaging scan may be considered for your child if their medical professional is concerned about the following: Injury to other nearby structures—the eyes, mouth, other parts of the face or head A  concussion  or brain injury Bleeding from somewhere other than the nose  Other complications such as signs of infection (fever, nasal drainage, swelling or redness of the nose) that may start days later How is a broken nose treated? Consider    over-the-counter  pain medications for your child's discomfort. Surgery to reset a broken nose If your child's nose is broken and off-center, or if your child is having trouble with breathing, a surgeon might need to adjust your child's nose back into place. This surgery usually needs to be done under anesthesia within one to two weeks of the injury, before the nose heals. If there are other suspected injuries or complications seen on exam or CT scan, other specialists may need to be involved for further evaluations and treatments.

        "content": "If your child is sneezing and has a clear nasal discharge and swollen nasal mem­branes, he may have hay fever. Also called  seasonal allergic rhinitis,  hay fever is an al­lergic condition affecting the upper respi­ratory tract. While the offending allergen may be hay or other pollen-producing plants, this disorder has nothing to do with fever, despite its name.\t A youngster with this condition may have dark circles under red, teary eyes, and he may itch in places he cannot easily scratch, like inside the nose and ears, or on the roof of the mouth. As a result, he might wrinkle or rub his nose a lot to try to re­lieve the discomfort.\t For each child there tends to be a hay fever season that depends on the geo­graphical location; usually it starts in the early spring and continues through the fall. Symptoms may appear when the air con­tains high levels of pollen from ragweed, grass, weeds, and trees, as well as from mold spores.\t Hay fever is actually the most common of all allergic conditions, and the tendency to develop it is frequently inherited. Since the allergens that cause hay fever are in the air, they are very difficult to avoid. Nonetheless, as with other types of aller­gies, the best defense against hay fever is for your child to stay away from the al­lergens that trigger the attacks. For exam­ple, if possible, your child should sleep with the windows closed and the air conditioner on.\t When symptoms occur, your doctor may recommend an antihistamine to help control the runny nose, sneezing, and itchiness. As a general rule, begin giving the antihistamine when symptoms first ap­pear; your doctor may recommend that it be taken preventively throughout the hay fever season. Your doctor should personal­ize and adjust the dosage of the antihista­mine and try different types to find the best one for your child. The newer prescription antihistamines on the market do not cause drowsiness.\t For more severe cases, special nasal sprays—such as cromolyn or cortico­steroid sprays—might be prescribed. Allergy shots can also help create an im­munity to the offending allergen.\t Hay fever—or  seasonal  allergic rhinitis— is a different condition than  perennial  aller­gic rhinitis. The perennial type occurs throughout the year in response to ever-present allergens such as the house mite, a microscopic insect that is present in dust. Mites may be more plentiful during some seasons and may thus also be a cause of seasonal allergies. The treatment options are the same for both symptom patterns but must be applied year-round for peren­nial allergies.",

        "content": "Ears may be pierced for cosmetic reasons at any age. If the piercing is performed carefully and cared for properly, there is little risk, no matter what the age of the child. However, as a general guideline, postpone the piercing until your child is mature enough to take care of the pierced site themselves.  What is the best way to avoid infection after ear piercing? For the actual piercing procedure, have a doctor, nurse or experienced technician perform it. Rubbing alcohol or other disinfectants should be used to minimize the chances of an infection.  At the time of the piercing, a round, gold-post earring should be inserted. Some piercing instruments themselves can put the gold posts in place at the same time. This can avoid any additional probing that can increase the chance of infection. The gold in the posts will reduce the risk of an allergic reaction and inflammation in the area.\t After the piercing, apply rubbing alcohol or an antibiotic ointment to the area two times a day for a few days; these applications will cut down the chances of infection and hasten the healing process. The earring should not be removed for four to six weeks, but should be gently rotated each day. If the area of piercing becomes red or tender, an infection may be developing, and you should seek medical attention promptly.",

        "content": "​Your child probably will have more colds, or what are called \"upper respiratory infections,\" than any other illness. In the first two years of life alone, most children have eight to ten colds. And if there are older school-age children in your house, you may see even more, since colds easily pass from one child to another. That's the bad news, but there is some good news, too: Most colds go away by themselves and do not lead to anything worse.\t   How colds spread Colds are caused by viruses (these are much smaller than bacteria). A sneeze or a cough by someone with a virus can then be breathed in by another person, making them sick. The virus may also go from one person to another, in the following ways: Children or adults with the virus can cough, sneeze, or touch their nose and get some of the virus on their hands. They then touch the hand of a healthy person. The healthy person then touches their own nose, and the virus grows in the healthy person's nose or throat. A cold can then develop. This can happen again and again, with the virus moving from that newly sick child or adult to another person. How to tell when a child has a cold Once the virus gets into the body and grows more and more viruses, your child will get some of these signs and symptoms: Runny nose (first, a clear liquid coming out; later, a thicker, often colored mucus) Sneezing Low            fever  (101–102 degrees Fahrenheit [38.3–38.9 degrees Celsius]), particularly at night Not wanting to eat Sore throat and, perhaps, difficulty swallowing Cough Fussiness on-and-off Slightly swollen            glands Pus on the tonsils, especially in children three years and older, may mean your child has an infection called            strep . If your child has a typical cold without major problems, the symptoms should go away slowly after seven to ten days. When to call the pediatrician Older children with a cold don't usually need to see a doctor unless they look very sick. If a child is      three months or younger , however, call the pediatrician at the first sign of illness. With young babies, it may be hard to tell when they are very sick. Colds can quickly become dangerous problems, such as      bronchiolitis ,      croup , or pneumonia. For a child older than three months, call the pediatrician if: The openings of the nose (nostrils) are get larger with each breath, the skin above or below the ribs sucks in with each breath (retractions), or your child is breathing fast or having any trouble breathing. The lips or nails turn blue. Nasal mucus lasts for longer than 10 to 14 days. The cough just won't go away (it lasts more than a week). They have ear pain. Their temperature is over 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius). They are too sleepy or cranky. Your child's doctor may want to see your child, or may ask you to watch them closely and report back. They will want to know if your child doesn't get better each day and is not completely better within one week from the start of her illness. How to treat a cold Unfortunately, there's no cure for the common cold.      Antibiotics  may be used to fight infections caused by bacteria, but they have no effect on viruses. The best thing you can do is to make your child comfortable, gets plenty of rest and drinks extra amounts of liquids. See     \t Caring for Your Child's Cold or Flu  for more information on treatment options. Prevention For babies under three months old, the best prevention against the common cold is to keep them away from people who have one. This is especially true during the winter, when more people are sick with viruses. A virus that causes a mild illness in an older child or an adult can cause a more serious one in an infant. Teach your child to sneeze or cough away from others, into the crook of their elbow or shoulder. Even using a tissue (and putting it in the trash right away) or handkerchief is better than having your child cover their mouth with their hand when sneezing or coughing. If the virus lands on her hand, it can spread to whatever they touch—a sibling, a friend, or a toy Everyone should be encouraged to wash their hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. This can help stop colds and other viruses from spreading.

        "content": "​​​Your child is almost certain to have at least one nosebleed—and probably many—during their early years. Some preschoolers have several a week. This is neither abnormal nor dangerous, but it can be very frightening. If blood flows down from the back of the nose into the mouth and throat, your child may swallow a great deal of it, which in turn may cause vomiting. What causes nosebleeds? There are many causes of nosebleeds, most of which aren’t serious. Beginning with the most common, they include: Colds and allergies:  A cold or allergy causes swelling and irritation inside the nose and may lead to spontaneous bleeding. Trauma:  A child can get a nosebleed from picking their nose, putting something into it, or just blowing it too hard. A nosebleed also can occur if they are hit in the nose by a ball or other object, of fall and hit their nose. Low humidity or irritating fumes:  If your house is very dry, or if you live in a dry climate, the lining of your child’s nose may dry out. This makes it more likely to bleed. If they are frequently exposed to toxic fumes (fortunately, an unusual occurrence), they may get nosebleeds, too. Anatomical problems:  Any abnormal structure inside the nose can lead to crusting and bleeding. Abnormal growths:  Any abnormal tissue growing in the nose may cause bleeding. Although most of these growths (usually polyps) are benign (not cancerous), they still should be treated promptly. Abnormal blood clotting:  Anything that interferes with blood clotting can lead to nosebleeds. Medications, even common ones like  ibuprofen , can alter blood-clotting just enough to cause bleeding. Blood diseases, such as hemophilia, also can provoke and worsen nosebleeds. Chronic illness:  Any child with a long-term illness, or who may require extra oxygen or other medication that can dry out or affect the lining of the nose, is likely to have nosebleeds. How to treat nosebleeds in children There are many misconceptions and folktales about how to treat nosebleeds. Here’s a list of dos and don’ts. Do. . . Remain calm. A nosebleed can be frightening, but is rarely serious. Keep your child in a sitting or standing position. Tilt their head slightly forward. Pinch the lower half of your child’s nose (the soft part) between your thumb and finger and hold it firmly for at least 10 minutes. If your child is old enough, they can do this themselves. Don’t release the nose during this time to see if it is still bleeding (no peeking)! Stopping the pressure may interfere with the forming of the clot and allow the bleeding to continue. Release the pressure after 10 minutes and wait, keeping your child quiet and still. If the bleeding hasn’t stopped, hold pressure again. If after 10 more minutes of pressure the bleeding hasn’t stopped, call your pediatrician or go to the nearest emergency department. Don’t . . . Panic. You’ll just scare your child. Have them lie down or tilt back their head. Stuff tissues, gauze, or any other material into your child’s nose to stop the bleeding. Also call your pediatrician if: You think your child may have lost too much blood or continues to bleed heavily. (But keep in mind that the blood coming from the nose always looks like a lot.) The bleeding is coming only from your child’s mouth, or he’s coughing or vomiting blood or brown material that looks like coffee grounds. Your child is unusually pale or sweaty, or is not responsive. Call your pediatrician immediately in this case, and arrange to get your child to the emergency room. He has a lot of nosebleeds, along with a chronically stuffy nose. This may mean he has a small, easily broken blood vessel in the nose or on the surface of the lining of the nose, or a growth in the nasal passages. If a blood vessel is causing the problem, the doctor may touch that point with a chemical substance (silver nitrate) to stop the bleeding. How to prevent nosebleeds If your child gets a lot of nosebleeds, ask your pediatrician about using saltwater (saline) nose drops every day. Doing so may be particularly helpful if you live in a very dry climate, or when the furnace is on. In addition, a humidifier or vaporizer will help maintain your  home’s humidity at a level high enough to prevent nasal drying. Also tell your child not to pick their nose. If your child still gets nosebleeds despite the moisture to the nostrils, the doctor may refer your child to a pediatric ear, nose and throat doctor (ENT or otolaryngologist) or do tests to evaluate for a bleeding disorder.",

        "content": "What are the symptoms of an ear infection?\t Your child may have many symptoms during an ear infection. Talk with your pediatrician about the best way to treat your child's symptoms.\t   Pain.  The most common symptom of an ear infection is pain. Older children can tell you that their ears hurt. Younger children may only seem irritable and cry. You may notice this more during feedings because sucking and swallowing may cause painful pressure changes in the middle ear.\t Loss of appetite.  Your child may have less of an appetite because of the ear pain.\t Trouble sleeping.  Your child may have trouble sleeping because of the ear pain.\t Fever.  Your child may have a temperature ranging from 100°F (normal) to 104°F.\t Ear drainage.  You might notice yellow or white fluid, possibly blood-tinged, draining from your child's ear. The fluid may have a foul odor and will look different from normal earwax (which is orange-yellow or reddish-brown). Pain and pressure often decrease after this drainage begins, but this doesn't always mean that the infection is going away. If this happens it's not an emergency, but your child will need to see your pediatrician.\t Trouble hearing.  During and after an ear infection, your child may have trouble hearing for several weeks. This occurs because the fluid behind the eardrum gets in the way of sound transmission. This is usually temporary and clears up after the fluid from the middle ear drains away.\t Important: Your doctor cannot diagnose an ear infection over the phone; your child's eardrum must be examined by your doctor to confirm fluid buildup and signs of inflammation.\t Other causes of ear pain\t There are other reasons why your child's ears may hurt besides an ear infection. The following can cause ear pain:\t   An infection of the skin of the ear canal, often called \"swimmer's ear\"\t Reduced pressure in the middle ear from colds or allergies\t A sore throat\t Teething or sore gums\t Inflammation of the eardrum alone during a cold (without fluid buildup)",

        "content": "Armed with antibacterial wipes, children’s pain reliever, and books about the A-to-Z of health care, most parents are ready to declare war on germs that threaten their kids. In spite of all that, three out of four children will get an ear infection before the age of 3.\t While ear infections are still a very typical part of childhood, the treatments for the condition are changing. These days, taking your child to the doctor will likely result in less medication and even less cause for alarm than ever before.\t When Is It an Infection?\t A typical middle ear infection in a child begins with either a viral infection (such as a common cold) or unhealthy bacterial growth. Sometimes the middle ear becomes inflamed and causes fluid buildup behind the eardrum. In other cases, the eustachian tubes — the narrow passageways connecting the middle ear to the back of the nose — become swollen.  Children are more prone to both of these problems for several reasons. The passages in their ears are narrower, shorter, and more horizontal than the adult versions. Because it’s easier for germs to reach the middle ear, it’s also easier for fluid to get trapped there. And just as children are still developing, so are their immune systems. Once the infection takes hold, it’s harder for a child’s body to fight it than it is for a healthy adult’s.\t The symptoms of an ear infection may be hard to detect. A child who constantly tugs or pulls at the ear could simply be exploring, or simply showing a self-soothing reflex — even though that tops the list of signals listed in many books and Web sites. Other symptoms can include:\t More crying than usual, especially when lying down\t Trouble sleeping or hearing\t Fever or headache\t Fluid coming out of the ears\t Doctors can use special instruments to see if an infection is present.\t “You must take very seriously a cold that wakes a child up at night,” says Dr. Robert M. Jacobson, chair of the Mayo Clinic’s Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine. Since a cold normally causes tiredness, any sleep interruption could indicate pain and stuffiness. “In fact, any pain when lying down is cause for concern, as is a cold that lasts for more than 10 days,” he says. These are signs that a cold may have spread to the ears or sinuses.\t Treatment: Less May Be More\t Perhaps the most surprising news is that common ear infections rarely require medication or any other action, except when severe or in young infants. “The body’s immune system can usually resolve them,” says Dr. Jacobson. “More and more studies show that children treated or untreated are at the same place 10 days out. We are constantly amazed at how many ear infections resolve on their own.”\t It’s true: Fewer doctors are relying on antibiotics, which can help only if the infection is not caused by a virus. As Dr. Jacobson points out, it’s important to understand that taking antibiotics might or might not speed recovery, and overusing them can lead to bacteria developing resistance to the drugs, as the germs mutate to defend themselves against medicine. As a result, many pediatricians have adopted a wait-and-see approach, rather than prescribing antibiotics at the first sign of infection.\t Asking the parents to observe the child for 48 to 72 hours is becoming the most common first step among pediatricians. That doesn’t mean that an office visit isn’t a good idea, however. Doctors can prescribe numbing drops and suggest over-the-counter pain relievers to treat symptoms, which can help the child feel better as she recovers. At home, parents can place a warm washcloth over the painful ear.\t Along with getting away from prescriptions, pediatricians are also shying away from myringotomy, a procedure in which a small tube is surgically inserted in the ear to drain fluid. According to Dr. Jacobson, tube placement is best used with those children who have recurring hearing problems caused by multiple infections.\t “Tubes don’t actually stop ear infections, just symptoms and fluid retention,” says Dr. Jacobson. “We don’t want to do it too often because there is an increased risk of damage to the eardrum.”\t According to Dr. Jacobson, diagnosis and treatment should be a three-step process:\t First, the pediatrician determines whether or not an ear infection is present.\t Second, the pediatrician and parent discuss risk factors and how to reduce them.\t Finally, observation and treatment of symptoms ensure the child is recovering without pain.\t Reducing the Risks for Ear Infection\t While parents can’t head off every germ that’s headed for their children, they can take steps to reduce their children’s risks. Smoking is a huge contributor to childhood illness. Ear infections are no exception to that rule. Smoking is addictive and hard to quit, but not every smoker realizes the harmful effects that secondhand smoke could have on his or her child. Quitting is just as important for your child’s health as your own.\t Bad hygiene habits  are another major problem. Children in daycare are more exposed to widespread bacteria, as are those who drink from a bottle as opposed to a sippy cup, says Dr. Jacobson. That’s because bottles have more surface area for germs to live on. Teach children to wash their hands frequently to prevent the spread of germs that spread illness.\t Talk with your child’s doctor about the  vaccines that protect against pneumonia and meningitis . Studies show that vaccinated children experience fewer ear infections.\t Breastfeed infants  for the first year. Breast milk has many substances that protect your baby from a variety of diseases and infections. Because of these protective substances, breastfed children are less likely to have bacterial or viral infections, such as ear infections\t Consider getting immunized against influenza.  Aside from protecting against this yearly disease, it can help prevent ear infections.\t  \t   This article was featured in Healthy Children Magazine. To view the full issue,  click here .",

        "content": "By: Noah Alter & Samuel Ostrower, MD, FAAP When parents and caregivers talk about health concerns they see in their children, ear infections often top the list. Maybe that's because nearly    5 out of every 6  children will experience one before their third birthday—and for some, painful infections will become an ongoing pattern that causes sleep loss, low mood and more.  Why are ear infections so common in children, and what's the best way to prevent and treat them?  Here are answers to the questions pediatricians hear most often, along with research findings that offer helpful guidance.  What causes ear infections? An ear infection happens when bacteria or viruses infect the small space behind the eardrum, known as the middle ear. This area is normally filled with air and contains three tiny bones that help us hear.  Middle ear infections (otitis media) This type of ear infection in the middle ear is also known as  otitis media . A small passageway called the eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the back of the nose and throat. When the eustachian tube becomes blocked, usually due to a cold or allergies, fluid can build up in the middle ear. This creates an environment that is perfect for bacteria or viruses to grow. This infection can cause an  earache , fever and difficulty hearing. While most ear infections go away on their own, some require medication such as  antibiotics  to treat the infection. Infection of the middle ear (otitis media) is different from an infection of the ear canal (otitis externa), which is also called    swimmer's ear . How can I tell when my child has an ear infection? Many adults assume that if a child tugs or  pulls at their ear , this suggests they have an ear infection. However, many babies and small children do this to self-soothe or simply play with their ears. Here are additional symptoms of ear infection to look for in your child:\t Ear pain.  This can be a sharp pain or dull, throbbing ache. Discomfort might come and go or remain constant. It is common for the pain to be worse at night.\t Trouble hearing . Your child might complain that their ear is  plugged up  or that they can't hear very well. Babies and toddlers might not respond as they normally would when you speak to them. Some children with prolonged  hearing  loss related to ear infections may have delayed speech and language development.\t   Fever .  Your child's body temperature may be higher than 98.6 degrees, which is generally considered normal.\t Ear drainage . Sometimes pus or fluid can come out of your child's ear, which can be a sign of an infection which may have ruptured the eardrum.\t   Headache :  Your child might complain of pressure or pain in the head or ear(s). Rest assured that if your child isn't hearing well right now, the problem will clear up when the infection does. Generally, there is no danger of lasting damage to their hearing—but this doesn't mean you should put off calling your pediatrician. Ear infections can cause serious discomfort and  sleep  loss, so it's important to have your child checked right away. Why do kids get more ear infections than grownups? Kids are more susceptible to ear infections because: \t Their immune systems are still developing,  which makes it harder for them to fight off any infection.\t The  eustachian tube   that connects a child's middle ear to the back of their throat is shorter, narrower and more horizontal than an adult's. This makes it harder for fluid to drain out of the ear, which can lead to fluid buildup and bacterial growth. What other factors can cause ear infections (or make them worse)? Your child may develop an ear infection when:\t They have a cold, flu or allergy symptoms  that cause congestion and sneezing, causing fluid to build up in the ear.\t They have daily exposure to germs  that cause colds, flu and other respiratory illnesses—for example, at school or child care.\t They drink from a bottle,  especially when lying down for a nap or overnight. \t They spend time around people who smoke , or in environments where smokers have been.   Secondhand  and    thirdhand  smoke have been shown to elevate a child's risks for ear infections and other health issues such as bronchitis,    pneumonia , susceptibility to colds and even    tooth decay. How are childhood ear infections diagnosed? Diagnosis and treatment planning for ear infections involves 3 recommended steps: Your pediatrician will determine whether an infection is present  by checking their temperature and using a scope to look inside the ear.   If the  eardrum  is red and bulging, this suggests an infection is present. If the outer ear canal is inflamed but the eardrum appears normal, swimmer's ear might be the cause. You and your pediatrician will talk about risk factors  for ear infections and how to reduce them. This can help prevent chronic infections that affect your child's well-being. If your child has an infection , you and your pediatrician will keep an eye on your child's symptoms to ensure they are recovering without pain. Will my child need antibiotics? When it comes to safely treating a child's ear infection, studies show that less is more. Even though your doctor wants to provide quick relief, they may also want to wait 48 to 72 hours before prescribing antibiotics for a possible infection. Here's why.    Around 80% of childhood ear infections clear up on their own without medication.  Frequent use of antibiotics can lead to    antibiotic resistance , which can actually make it harder for your child's immune system to fight off future infections of all kinds (including life-threatening ones).  So what are the best options for treating ear infections?  In many cases, the best course of treatment involves no antibiotics. In this case, your pediatrician may suggest:\t Over-the-counter pain relievers  such as  acetaminophen  or  ibuprofen  can help reduce pain and fever associated with ear infections. (Due to risks of    Reye syndrome , a rare but serious condition seen in children under 15 months,    NEVER give aspirin to your baby or toddler.  For guidelines on which over-the-counter pain relievers are safe for kids and how much to give, check out this helpful    article .)\t Watchful waiting  to make sure the infection clears up within a few days to a week. Your child's doctor may decide that antibiotics are a better option if: Your child is under 2 years old  (which means they are more susceptible to complications from an ear infection). The infection is severe , or your child is suffering from serious pain or fever. Symptoms have lasted for several days  and appear to be getting worse. Your child has a weakened immune system  or another medical condition that makes them more susceptible to complications. If antibiotics are prescribed, what do I need to know? For more severe or widespread ear infections, oral antibiotics may be prescribed. Follow these steps to protect your child's health when taking antibiotics:\t Make sure they finish all their medication.  Skipping the last few doses of an antibiotic can allow the infection to return, which can ultimately make it even harder to get rid of.\t Consider adding probiotics  to protect your child's   gut microbiome from the possible effects of antibiotics. Here's    how probiotics work  to keep your child's digestive and immune systems healthy.\t Watch for \t   side effects .  Around 1 in 5 children have nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain, rashes or allergic reactions when they take antibiotics. Talk to your pediatrician if you see these symptoms in your child. Make sure to tell your child's medical team if you know they have an allergy to a specific medication or they've had a negative reaction to antibiotics in the past. My child has chronic ear infections. Will ear tubes help? Certain children — those with severe recurring ear infections, trouble hearing and/or speech delay after multiple ear infections, multiple antibiotic allergies, and other complications from ear infections—may benefit from ear tubes. Surgically inserted through the eardrum, these small tubes make it easier for fluids to drain from the ear.  Pediatricians and other health experts may recommend tubes less often, however, since  studies  have shown that standard treatment (including careful use of antibiotics) works equally well. If you're wondering about this treatment for your child, ask your pediatrician for more insights. What else do I need to know about treating and preventing childhood ear infections?\t Your child can't catch an ear infection from others.  Ear infections aren't contagious—which means that as soon as they feel good enough, kids can return to child care or school while recovering from an ear infection. But keep in mind that many ear infections do start with colds,  flu  or  RSV —which can result from viruses passed along by others.  Hand washing , healthy eating and other steps that build immunity against infection will reduce your child's risks for chronic ear infections.\t Breastfeeding protects your child from ear (and other) infections  by strengthening their immune system from the very start. Learn more about breastfeeding and your child's long-term health    here .\t Vaccinations help prevent ear infections . Following    vaccine guidelines  can reduce your child's risks for conditions that can lead to ear infections, including pneumonia and meningitis. The  flu vaccine  can also help prevent childhood ear infections. More questions? Talk with your pediatrician Because ear infections are so common in kids, your child's doctor has extensive experience in diagnosing and treating them. When you're worried about possible signs of an infection or wondering how to care for your child, talk with your pediatrician.

        "content": "The epiglottis is a tongue-like flap of tissue at the back of the throat. Ordinarily it prevents food and liquid from entering the windpipe when one swallows. In epiglottitis, a rare but serious condition, this structure becomes infected, usually by bacteria called  Haemophilus influenzae  type B. This condition is life-threatening, because when the epiglottis is swollen, it can block the trachea (windpipe) and interfere with normal breathing. Children between two and six years old are most susceptible to this problem. Fortunately, this condition is now uncommon thanks to the Hib vaccine, which prevents infections due to  Haemophilus influenzae  type B.\t The infection begins with a sore throat and a fever that usually is greater than 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 degrees Celsius) and quickly makes your child feel very sick. Her throat will become extremely sore. With each breath, she may make a harsh or raspy noise, called stridor. She may have such difficulty swallowing that she begins to drool. She probably will refuse to lie down and will be most comfortable sitting and leaning forward.\t Treatment\t If your child has an unusually sore throat and is drooling and/or breathing with difficulty, call your physician immediately. Because epiglottitis progresses so rapidly and has such serious consequences, do not attempt to treat it at home. After contacting your pediatrician, try to keep your child calm. Don’t try to examine her throat or insist that she lie down. Also, avoid offering food or water, because that might cause vomiting, which often makes breathing even more difficult. \t If you take your child to the pediatrician during the early stages of epiglottitis, the doctor should be able to determine if your child has this condition without the need for X-rays. But if her condition has worsened, and she begins drooling or has hoarse breathing, your pediatrician will probably ask you to take your child directly to the hospital emergency room, and recommend that you call 911 so an ambulance can transport her. At the hospital, with the help of an anesthesiologist and an otolaryngologist (an ear, nose, and throat specialist; ENT), the doctor will X-ray your child’s epiglottis. If it is thought to be severely inflamed, your child will be taken to the operating room where an anesthetic will be given and a tube will be inserted into the trachea (windpipe), bypassing the swelling and allowing your child to breathe comfortably again. In very severe cases, a tracheostomy (a breathing tube placed into the trachea through a small incision in the neck) may be necessary, but this is done much less often now than in the past.\t Your child also will be given antibiotics. All these decisions are likely to be made very quickly, and you may feel shocked that your child needs such extreme treatment for what looks like a simple though severe sore throat. It’s important to remember that epiglottitis progresses very rapidly and can become life-threatening if it goes untreated.\t Prevention\t The  Hib vaccine  is available to combat the bacteria that cause epiglottitis. Your child should receive the full series of the Hib vaccine, according to your  pediatrician’s recommendations . However, even if she has had the vaccine, consult your doctor if you know there has been an exposure to another child who has the infection. Your physician might want to take added precautions.",

        "content": "Hearing loss can happen at any age. However, hearing impairment at birth, or that develops in infants and toddlers, is of extra concern. It can lead to developmental challenges if not recognized and treated early, since normal hearing is needed to understand spoken language ⁠— and then, later, to produce clear speech. If your child experiences hearing impairment during infancy and early childhood, immediate attention is needed. Even a temporary but significant hearing impairment during this time can make it very challenging for the child to learn spoken language or speech patterns. Causes of hearing impairment in children Most children experience mild hearing loss when fluid builds up in the middle ear from congestion, colds, or ear infections. This hearing loss is usually only temporary; normal hearing commonly returns once the congestion or infection gets better and the Eustachian tube (which connects the middle ear to the throat) drains the remaining fluid into the back of the throat.  In many children, perhaps 1 in 10, fluid stays in the middle ear following an ear infection because of problems with the Eustachian tube. Children with this problem don't hear as well as children typically do. Because of this, they sometimes have delays in talking.  Much less common is the permanent kind of hearing impairment that always impacts normal speech and language development. Permanent hearing impairment varies from mild or partial to complete or total. Types of hearing impairment Conductive hearing loss When a child has a conductive hearing impairment, there may be an abnormality in the structure of the outer ear canal or middle ear. Or, there may be a large amount of cerumen (wax) lodged in the ear canal. Another possible cause is fluid in the middle ear that interferes with the transfer of sound. Sensorineural hearing loss (also called nerve deafness) This type of hearing impairment is caused by an abnormality of the inner ear or the nerves that carry sound messages from the inner ear to the brain. The impairment can be present at birth or occur anytime after. Even without a family history of deafness, the cause is frequently genetic) Parents and other family members often are unaffected because each parent is only a carrier for a hearing-loss gene. Or, if the birth parent had  rubella  (German measles), cytomegalovirus (CMV), toxoplasmosis, or another infectious illness that affects the inner ear during pregnancy, the fetus could have been infected and may lose hearing as a result. The impairment also may be from a malformation of the inner ear. Signs of hearing impairment to watch for Contact your pediatrician if: Your child doesn't startle at loud noises by  one month  or turn to the source of a sound by three to four months of age. They don't notice you until they see you. They concentrate on gargling and other vibrating noises that they can feel, rather than experimenting with a wide variety of vowel sounds and consonants. Their speech is delayed or hard to understand, or they don't say single words such as \"dada\" or \"mama\" by  12  to  15  months of age. They do not say five to 10 words by  18  months of age. They do not put two to three words together at two years ( 30  months) of age. Their speech is not understandable 50% of the time by two-and-a-half years of age. They don't always respond when called. (This is usually mistaken for inattention or resistance, but could be the result of a partial hearing impairment.) They seem to hear some sounds but not others. (Some hearing impairment affects only high-pitched sounds; some children have  hearing loss in only one ear .) They seem not only to hear poorly but also has trouble holding their head steady, or is slow to sit or walk unsupported. (In some children with sensorineural hearing impairment, the part of the inner ear that provides information about balance and movement of the head is also damaged.) Why early diagnosis is key for hearing loss Hearing impairment must be diagnosed as soon as possible, so that your child isn't delayed in learning language—a process that begins the day they are born. That's why, before baby goes home from the hospital after birth, they undergo a formal  newborn hearing screening . However, at any time during your child's life, if you or your pediatrician suspect that they have a hearing impairment, insist that a formal hearing evaluation be performed promptly.  Some family doctors, pediatricians, and well-baby clinics can test for hearing loss or fluid in the middle ear. If an impairment is detected, your child may be referred to an audiologist (hearing specialist), and/or an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor ( otolaryngologist ). Types of hearing exams for children  Auditory brainstem & otoacoustic emissions tests If your child is under six months old, is unable to cooperate with or understand a hearing exam, or has significant developmental delays, they may be given one of two available tests. These are similar to the tests performed during newborn hearing screenings. They are painless and can take anywhere from five minutes to an hour. The  auditory brainstem response  (ABR) test measures how the brain responds to sound during deep sleep. Clicks or tones are played into the baby's ears through soft earphones, and electrodes placed on the baby's head measure the brain's response. ABRs are performed during natural sleep in infants under three or four months old. Older babies and toddlers need to be sedated to undergo an ABR. The    otoacoustic emissions test  measures sound waves produced by the ear. A tiny probe is placed just inside the baby's ear canal, which then measures the response when clicks or tones are played into the baby's ear. Babies and young children usually do not need to be napping or sedated for this brief screening exam. It can be done at any age.  Behavioral audiometry Behavioral audiometry , or conditioned response audiometry, can be performed with a cooperative baby as young as six months old. This test uses a combination of visual and auditory stimuli. It can determine frequency-specific (although not ear-specific) hearing levels in infants and toddlers. Formal behavioral audiometry  can determine hearing levels as well as eardrum function in each ear. This is performed using soft earphones that send sounds and words to the ear. It is typically well tolerated by children in the three- to five-year age range. If these tests find that your baby may have a hearing impairment, a more thorough hearing evaluation should be done as soon as possible to confirm the diagnosis. Even mild hearing loss can affect overall hearing and should be properly diagnosed and treated. Treatment for hearing impairment in kids Treating a hearing impairment will depend on its cause. If it is a mild conductive hearing caused by fluid in the middle ear, the doctor may simply recommend that your child be retested in a few months to see whether the fluid has cleared by itself. Medication such as antihistamines, decongestants or antibiotics, are ineffective in clearing up middle ear fluid. Ventilating tubes If there is no improvement in hearing over a three-month period, and there is still fluid behind the eardrum, the doctor may recommend referral to an ENT specialist. If the fluid persists and there is sufficient (even though temporary) conductive hearing impairment from the fluid, the specialist may recommend draining the fluid through ventilating tubes. These are surgically inserted through the eardrum. This is a minor operation and takes about 15 minutes, but your child must receive a general anesthetic for it to be done properly. Even with the tubes in place, future infections can occur. But the tubes help reduce the amount of fluid and decrease your child's risk of repeated infection. If the cause for the hearing loss was purely the fluid, they will also improve hearing. Hearing aids If a conductive hearing loss is due to a malformation of the outer or middle ear, a hearing aid may restore hearing to normal or near-normal levels. However, a hearing aid will work only when it's being worn. You must make sure it is on and functioning at all times, particularly in a very young child. Reconstructive surgery may be considered when the child is older. Early placement of hearing aids for infants with hearing impairment is important to give them awareness of sound and language. Early exposure to either spoken or visual (sign) language has a very positive impact on language development. In children with mild to moderate sensorineural hearing impairment, hearing aids can improve hearing so much that most can develop normal speech and spoken language.  Cochlear implants If your child has severe or profound hearing impairment in both ears and gets little or no benefit from hearing aids, they could be a candidate for cochlear implants. If your family is considering an implant for a child whose hearing loss occurred at birth, the best chances to develop useful speech and hearing come with getting the implants early (ideally by one year of age) rather than late (over three years old).  Most children with typical development who get cochlear implants early, along with intensive therapy after the surgery, can develop good to excellent hearing and can be supported in a mainstream educational setting. In addition, almost all children with cochlear implants gain better awareness of sounds in their environment.  Learning to communicate with hearing loss Parents of children with sensorineural hearing loss usually are most concerned about whether their child will learn to talk. The answer is that although optimally timed cochlear implantation will greatly improve the chances of learning spoken language, not all may learn to speak clearly. However, all children with a hearing loss can be taught to communicate. Some children learn to lipread well, while others never fully master the skill.  Beyond spoken language: learning to sign Keep in mind that speech is only one form of communication. For children who didn't get enough improvement from hearing aids or cochlear implants to develop spoken language, or for those families who have chosen not to pursue it,  sign language  is another type of communication that can be learned.  If your child is learning sign language, you and your immediate family also must learn it. This way you will be able to teach, praise, comfort, and laugh with them. Encourage friends and relatives to learn signing, too. Written language is very important as well, because it is the key to educational and future career success.

        "content": "By: Eileen Raynor MD, FACS, FAAP & Brian Reilly, MD, FAAP   At a young age, children typically learn to communicate by making sounds with their voice. Children with  hoarseness , also called dysphonia, have a raspy and deeper than usual voice (or cry). This can make it harder to communicate through vocalizations. A hoarse voice can also make it difficult for others to understand the child's speech and affect how they make friends and do well in school.  It can be difficult for parents and teachers to recognize dysphonia, since children are rarely screened for the condition. Here is what you need to know about the evaluation and treatment for pediatric hoarseness.     What causes hoarseness in a child's voice? Hoarseness in children can be mild or severe, depending on the cause of the condition. Here are potential factors causing your child's voice hoarse voice symptoms:   The common cold  can cause hoarseness due to laryngitis (swollen vocal cords). Most laryngitis in children can cause vocal hoarseness symptoms for 1 to 2 weeks. Allergies   are also a common hoarse-voice cause. An allergic reaction or seasonal allergies to pollen may be a factor in your child's dysphonia. Hoarseness will last until allergy symptoms clear. Overuse of vocal cords  can strain your child's voice. This may include frequent yelling, singing and throat clearing. Harsh imitation sounds like roaring or shrieking can also cause strain. Hoarseness from strained vocal cords may last for 2 weeks or longer. Vocal fold paresis/paralysis (VFP)  is when one or both vocal folds (cords) are not moving properly. If this condition is causing your child's raspy voice, it can lead to a breathy sounding voice. It may also cause difficulty swallowing thin liquids like water. Vocal fold lesions  such as   nodules and cysts  are the most common cause of hoarseness. In addition to affecting the voice, they sometimes cause pain and a feeling that something is in the throat (which can lead to more throat clearing sounds). Children who are performers may be more likely to develop lesions if they are not following good vocal hygiene practices or working with a voice coach. This cause of vocal hoarseness can last for months, depending on how severe the lesions are and how they are treated. Some rare congenital conditions  can affect the nerves that control the larynx and cause a hoarse voice in your child. Your child's pediatrician may refer your family to a pediatric ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for screening.     Treatment for mild hoarseness in children For many children who develop hoarseness, symptoms will clear up within a week. Mild vocal hoarseness can be treated by:   Resting the voice and throat Using a  humidifier  in your home Drinking soothing, warm liquids and plenty of water     How is prolonged or chronic hoarseness diagnosed? If hoarseness in your child's voice lasts more than a month, talk with their pediatrician. Your child's doctor may refer your family to a pediatric ENT doctor for further evaluation. What is a laryngoscopy? According to the American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, a child should be referred for a laryngoscopy (visualization of the vocal folds) if hoarseness lasts 4 weeks. In some cases of hoarseness, such as unexplained vocal cord paralysis, a CT scan of the laryngeal nerves (voice box) might be requested. A laryngoscopy is a transnasal (through the nose) procedure. Your child would be awake, so their doctor can assess vocal frequency and loudness. Sometimes a numbing spray can be used to make it less uncomfortable. The scope generally lasts less than 2 minutes. Most children 4 and older can participate in this procedure, which is conducted by a pediatric ENT.     Treatment for chronic hoarseness in children Treatment options for prolonged hoarseness in children depend on the diagnosis from their doctor. Various treatments include:   Voice therapy,  which is the most common treatment for prolonged hoarseness. It teaches children and parents techniques to reduce phonotrauma (vocal cord trauma). This option gives lesions and nodules time to heal. Vocal cord injections  may be used for vocal fold paralysis/paresis. Injected materials treat the weak or paralyzed cord to improve vocal quality. This is done under anesthesia in children. Laryngeal surgery  may be an option if your child has large nodules and has completed at least 6 months of voice therapy with little to no improvement in hoarseness. Surgery is typically used in severe cases of prolonged hoarseness. Children will still need to undergo voice therapy after the surgery once they recover.     Remember Talk with your child's pediatrician if you have concerns about their hoarseness of their voice, how they communicate or any other questions about their health.

        "content": "​Many parents will agree that their teens just don't listen. But what if it is because they can't hear? Pediatricians have noticed that using earbuds or headphones might be damaging teens' hearing. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) wants to prevent this type of  hearing loss  and is recommending screening teens for hearing damage at higher tones to find out if they have high frequency hearing loss. Kids expose themselves to noise through  electronic media  that often is louder than what is allowed by law in a workplace, according to Joseph F. Hagan Jr., M.D., FAAP, co-editor of the  AAP Bright Futur​es Guidelines . \"We know that does cause problems with high frequency hearing loss.\" Recommended Hearing Screenings for Older Children & Teens  Kids should be screened at three ages:  11-14 years 15-17 years 18-21 years The test includes having a patient listen for a series of beeps through headphones to determine whether the patient can hear a range of pitches. One in six adolescents has high frequency hearing loss, according to a study. This type of hearing loss is caused by exposure to loud noises, such as music played through headphones. The authors of another study were surprised to find that the sound of a balloon popping is louder than a shotgun being fired. Both are loud enough to cause hearing loss. They warned that hearing damage is similar to sun damage. Too much can cause harm over time. What More Can Parents Do?  Parents can help prevent hearing loss by teaching safe listening habits. Kids should take breaks after an hour of listening and turn the volume down to about 60% on their audio players. Youths should be able to hear conversations going on around them while listening to the music, according to the AAP.  \"What I tell my own patients is, 'If it hurts, there's a reason it hurts. Turn it down. If your ears feel funny afterwards, you had it on too loud,'\" Dr. Hagan said. \"As a dad, I used to say to my own kids, 'If I can hear it, it's too loud.'\" Find more hearing loss prevention tips  here .",

        "content": "By:  Shravani Vundavalli, MD, FAAP \t Rhinovirus  ( rhin means \"nose\")  infections cause the common cold.  Rhinoviruses may also cause some sore throats, ear infections, and infections of the sinuses (openings in the bone near the nose and eyes). They may also cause      pneumonia  and      bronchiolitis , but this is less common. ​Most children have about 8 to 10 colds during the first 2 years of life. If a child spends time in child care settings where he or she is near other children with colds, the child may catch  even more colds . \t Rhinoviruses easily pass from one person to another. When a child with a rhinovirus infection has a runny nose, the liquid from her nose get on to her hands and from there on to tables, toys, and other places. Your child might touch the hands or skin of another child or toys that have the virus on it and then touch her own eyes or nose, infecting herself. She might also breathe in viruses that are in the air when a sick child sneezes or coughs. Even though your child can get a cold at any time of the year, these infections are most common during the fall and spring. What happens when a child gets a cold? Most people know the signs and symptoms of the common cold. Your child's cold may start with a watery, runny nose that looks like a clear liquid. Later, the discharge becomes thicker and is often a brownish, gray, or greenish color. These colors are normal to see as the child begins to get better from a cold. When your child has a cold, you may also see:  Sneezing A mild fever (101°F–102°F or 38.3°C–38.9°C) Headaches Sore throat Cough Muscle aches A decrease in appetite In some children, you may see pus (whitish mucus) on the tonsils, which could be a sign of a type of infection caused by a bacteria ( Streptococcus ). Usually a child who has a rhinovirus infection won't have any signs or symptoms for the first 2 to 3 days. Once the symptoms start, they usually last for 10 to 14 days, but sometimes the child will get better faster than that. What can I do to help my child feel better? When your child has a cold, make sure he or she gets enough rest and drinks extra fluid if he or she has a fever. If your child is uncomfortable, talk to his or her doctor about giving      acetaminophen  to lower the fever. Don't give      over-the-counter cold and cough medicines  without first checking with your doctor. Over-the-counter medicines do not kill the virus and, most of the time, will not help your child feel better. When should I call my child's doctor?\t If your baby is 3 months or younger and gets cold symptoms, talk with your child's doctor.  Young children are more likely to get sicker from colds, including getting pneumonia or bronchiolitis. Older children usually don't need to be seen by a doctor when they have a cold. Call the doctor if your older child has symptoms such as: Lips or nails that turn blue Noisy or difficult breathing A cough that doesn't get better         (See \t   Why Does My Child Have a Chronic Cough ) Very tired Ear pain, which may mean that your child has an         ear infection How can I tell when my child has a cold? You can tell your child has a cold based on watching his or her symptoms. In general, lab tests (like blood tests or throat cultures) are not needed to find out what kind of infection a child with cold symptoms has. How can I treat my child's rhinovirus infection? Most rhinovirus infections are mild, and no medication is needed.      Antibiotics  do not work for the common cold and other infections caused by viruses. What can I do to keep my child from getting a rhinovirus infection? Keep infants younger than 3 months away from children or adults who have colds. Make sure your child washes his or her hands often. This will decrease the chances he or she will get the virus.

        "content": "By: Diya Kallam, BA & Brian K. Reilly, MD, FACS, FAAP Single-sided deafness (SSD) is a hearing loss that affects at least    one in every 1,000  babies born. These infants have severe-to-profound hearing loss in one ear with typical or near-typical hearing in the other ear. The condition can also develop in older children and adults.  If your child shows symptoms of SSD, sometimes called unilateral hearing loss, talk with their doctor right away. Early identification of children who are deaf or hard of hearing (D/HH) is critical to language development.  Symptoms of single-sided deafness to know Tinnitus (ringing) in one ear Selective use of phone in only the hearing ear Head turning to hear the source of a sound Difficulty hearing in noisy environments\t Auditory fatigue  from the extra effort that listening requires Early diagnosis and treatment for hearing loss is key  How is single-sided deafness diagnosed? If any symptoms of SSD are identified, your child's pediatrician may refer your family to a pediatric audiologist who will perform the appropriate diagnostic and intervention services. A pediatric audiologist may perform a type of hearing test called a  behavioral audiogram .  For infants, the audiologist will perform an auditory brainstem response test. This hearing test involves tonal sounds and clicks that are played. Electrodes measure your child's response to these noises by tracking brainwaves.  Treatment for single-sided deafness Once diagnosed, there are several treatment options for SSD. Treatment may include steroids, varied seating in the classroom, hearing aids, or bone conduction hearing devices. The most successful treatment for SSD is cochlear implantation.  What is a cochlear implant?  A cochlear implant is an electronic device that sends signals to the cochlea (inner ear). These signals are perceived as sound and coded into speech.  How does a cochlear implant work? A    cochlear implant  consists of four parts: a microphone, sound processor, transmitter and electrode array. The microphone picks up sounds which are converted by the sound processor. The transmitter then sends the sounds into electrical impulses through an electrode array, which takes the impulses to the auditory nerve.  For patients with SSD, the cochlear implant is placed surgically under the scalp and behind one ear. Cochlear implants have been shown to improve hearing over time and offer a better quality of life for children with SSD.  How can a cochlear implant help your child?    Some of the major benefits that cochlear implants can offer children with SSD include: \t Sound localization , or the ability to identify the origin of a sound.    One study  found that error in figuring out where a sound was coming from was decreased by 34% after receiving a cochlear implant. There was also less head turning among patients. \t Speech discrimination , which is the ability to hear speech in quiet and noisy environments. has also been tested. Signals were played in noisy environments and patients with the cochlear implant were observed to see if they could pick out the sound. There was a significant improvement seen after patients underwent implantation.   \t Tinnitus reduction  can be a major benefit for children with SSD, helping them to more easily concentrate.    One study  found that tinnitus was completely suppressed in 43% of post-implant patients and that 38% of patients had a major improvement. \t Binaural (two ear) input  of sound to the brain can help with skills like localization and speech discrimination. Cochlear implants allow for binaural input, which can increase listening attention span.  What are the risks of cochlear implantation?  While cochlear implantation is generally a safe procedure, there are rare complications associated with it. \t Meningitis:  The pneumococcal vaccine should be given to kids who receive cochlear implants. Meningitis in children with cochlear implants usually develops due to the    Streptococcus pneumoniae  bacteria. Even without the vaccine, though, the likelihood of developing meningitis is still rare ( around 0.3% ). \t Facial nerve weakness:  Facial nerve weakness or paralysis is very uncommon, with rates as low    as 0.71% . All patients who develop facial nerve weakness or paralysis should be prescribed steroids to potentially regain full facial function.\t Dizziness:  Some patients developed    dizziness  or even vertigo post-implant, but    most cases  resolved within a month.  Although there are risks to cochlear implantation surgery, complications are rare and almost all patients recover quickly from them.  Alternate treatments for single-sided deafness  A cochlear implant is the only device to offer binaural input, allow for sound localization and reduce tinnitus. The localization error for CI patients is much lower than patients with other devices. \t Contralateral routing of sound devices  (CROS),    osseointegrated implants  (OI) and    bone anchored hearing aids  (BAHA) can also be used to treat SSD. These technologies can improve speech discrimination, although    research  shows that these devices are not as successful as cochlear implants. Patients are not able to overcome localization challenges and tinnitus as they can with cochlear implants.  CROS and OI may be considered for patients with congenital SSD.    Research  suggests that for children with congenital SSD, the benefits of cochlear implants may not be as apparent as they are in children with acquired SSD.  Who can get a cochlear implant?  Cochlear implants are recommended for children living with single-sided deafness as young as 9 months old. Earlier implantation typically results in better speech and language outcomes. Young children who receive cochlear implants typically show improvement in sound discrimination, speech development and sound localization.

        "content": "The terms  sore throat, strep throat,  and  tonsillitis  often are used interchangeably, but they don't mean the same thing. Strep throat  is an infection caused by a specific type of bacteria,  Streptococcus . When your child has a strep throat, the tonsils are usually very inflamed, and the inflammation may affect the surrounding part of the throat as well. Tonsillitis  is inflammation (swelling) of the  tonsils . Other causes of sore throats  include viruses, which may cause inflammation only of the throat around the tonsils and not of the tonsils themselves. Strep throat Strep throat  is caused by a bacte​rium called  Streptococcus pyogenes  or group A  Streptococcus . Strep throat is most common among school-age children and adolescents, peaking at 7 or 8 years of age. To some extent, the symptoms of strep throat depend on the child's age. Children over three years of age with strep may have an extremely painful throat, fever over 102 ​degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius), swollen glands in the neck and pus on the tonsils. Cough, runny nose, hoarseness (changes in your voices that make sound raspy) and conjunctivitis (also called pinkeye) are not symptoms of strep throat. If your child has these symptoms, a virus may be the cause of illness instead. It's important to be able to distinguish a strep throat from a viral sore throat, because strep infections are treated with antibiotics. Other infections that can cause a sore throat In infants, toddlers and preschoolers, the most frequent cause of sore throats is a  viral infection . No specific medicine is required when a virus is responsible, and your child should get better over a 7- to 10-day period. Often children who have sore throats due to viruses also have a cold at the same time. They may develop a mild fever, too, but they generally aren't very sick. One particular virus (called  Coxsackievirus ), seen most often during the summer and fall, may cause your child to have a somewhat higher fever and more difficulty swallowing. This virus can also cause a sicker overall feeling. If your child has a Coxsackie infection, they may have one or more blisters in their throat and on their hands and feet (often called  Hand, Foot, and Mouth disease ). Infectious  mononucleosis  (often called \"Mono\") can produce a sore throat, often along with tonsillitis. However, most young children who are infected with the mononucleosis virus have few or no symptoms. Diagnosing & treating a sore throat Call your pediatrician if your child has a sore throat that persists (not one that goes away after their first drink in the morning)—whether or not it is accompanied by fever, headache, stomachache or extreme fatigue. That call should be made even more urgently if your child seems extremely ill, or if they have difficulty breathing or extreme trouble swallowing (causing them to drool). This may indicate they have a more serious infection, such as epiglottitis. Rapid strep test Most pediatric offices perform rapid strep tests that provide findings within minutes. If the rapid strep test is negative, your doctor may confirm the result with a throat culture (see below). A negative test means that the infection is presumed to be due to a virus. In that case, antibiotics (which work against bacteria, not viruses) will not help and need not be prescribed. Throat culture The doctor will perform a throat culture to determine the nature of the infection. This involves touching the back of the throat and tonsils with a cotton-tipped applicator. The tip is then sent to a lab, where it is smeared onto a special culture dish that allows strep bacteria to grow if they are present. The culture dish usually is examined 24 hours later for the presence of the bacteria. Antibiotics If the test shows that your child does have strep throat, your pediatrician will prescribe an  antibiotic  to be taken by mouth or by injection (a shot). If your child is given the oral antibiotics, it's very important that they take it for the full course, as prescribed—even if the symptoms get better or go away. If a child's strep throat is not treated with antibiotics, or if they don't complete the treatment, the infection may worsen or spread to other parts of their body. This can lead to conditions such as  abscesses of the tonsils  or kidney problems. Untreated strep infections also can lead to rheumatic fever, a disease that affects the heart. However, rheumatic fever is rare in the United States and in children under 5 years old. Is strep throat and other types of throat infection contagious? Most types of throat infections are contagious. They are passed primarily through the air on droplets of moisture or on the hands of someone infected. For that reason, it makes sense to keep your child away from people who have symptoms of strep throat and other throat infections. However, most people are contagious before their first symptoms appear. So, there's often no practical way to prevent your child from contracting the disease. If my child gets strep throat a lot, should they have their tonsils out? In the past when a child had several sore throats, their tonsils might have been removed in an attempt to prevent further infections. But this operation, called a  tonsillectomy , is recommended today only for the most severely affected children. Even in difficult cases, where there is repeated strep throat, antibiotic treatment is usually the best solution.

        "content": "By: John E. McClay, MD, FAAP   If your baby's breathing is noisy sometimes, you might be wondering why. It could be stridor, a term for abnormal, loud breathing sounds. Stridor can have many different causes, including upper airway infections. When newborns and infants have stridor, however, one of the most common causes is a condition called laryngomalacia. Thankfully, stridor and laryngomalacia are usually not serious. What is stridor?  Stridor is a type of noisy breathing. It's most common in babies because their airways are narrower. It's usually described as a repetitive or high-pitched squeaking sound. It may happen occasionally or when your baby is resting. When a baby has stridor, this is a sign that something is partially blocking the upper airway.  There are many causes of stridor in children, including: Laryngomalacia Narrowing of the airway ( subglottic stenosis ) Inhaled foreign object Infections such as  croup  or  epiglottitis   Masses or lesions on the vocal cords Vocal cord weakness or paralysis In infants, the most common cause of stridor is a condition called laryngomalacia.   What is laryngomalacia?  Laryngomalacia is a common condition in newborns. It occurs when the tissues in the larynx (voice box) fall into the airway as your baby inhales, causing noisy breathing (stridor). The larynx is made of cartilage. In newborns, the cartilage is often soft and immature, which can make it floppy.  The good news is that for most infants this condition is not serious and goes away with time. In some cases, babies do end up needing surgery to treat the symptoms.  How do I know if my baby has laryngomalacia?  Most babies who have laryngomalacia start having symptoms within a few days to weeks after birth. These symptoms may include:  Noisy breathing Difficulty feeding or gasping/choking noises while feeding Spitting up a lot and being fussy after feeds.  Retractions—when the skin in your baby's neck or between their ribs is sucked in with every breath Pauses in breathing while sleeping  If your baby has any of these symptoms, they should be checked for laryngomalacia.  How is laryngomalacia diagnosed?  A pediatric ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist usually makes the diagnosis of laryngomalacia.  First, the ENT will get a thorough history of the types of symptoms your baby has. Next, the doctor will examine your baby with a procedure called flexible laryngoscopy .  This procedure uses a small scope that's inserted into your baby's nose in the office. The laryngoscopy lets the doctor look at your baby's vocal cords and larynx.  How is laryngomalacia treated?  Most babies with laryngomalacia don't need treatment. As your baby grows and the cartilage in their voice box becomes stronger, the symptoms usually go away by the time they're a year old. However, it can take until your child is about 18 months to 2 years of age to resolve completely. In the meantime, it's important to make sure that your child is growing and developing normally.  Babies who have laryngomalacia also commonly have  gastroesophageal reflux (GER) . GER is a condition in which stomach acid and food flow back up into the esophagus, the tube that connects the stomach to the mouth. GER is hardly ever serious in babies, but it can make laryngomalacia symptoms worse. Your baby may need medication for GER, which can improve their reflux symptoms and may also help with breathing.  When laryngomalacia surgery may be needed If your baby is having serious breathing problems, feeding problems, or isn't gaining weight like they should, surgery may be needed.  The surgical procedure to treat laryngomalacia is called a supraglottoplasty. It's done microscopically through your baby's mouth. Small instruments are used to remove the tissue that's causing the breathing problems from the larynx.  The procedure generally takes less than an hour. Your baby will likely be kept overnight in the hospital after surgery, but you should be able to go home the day after surgery. In most cases, your baby's symptoms will improve very quickly after the procedure.  Remember Don't hesitate to talk with your child's pediatrician if you have any concerns about your child's health.

        "content": "Swimmer's ear, which doctors call  otitis externa,  is an infection of the skin inside the ear canal or outer ear. This type of infection occurs most often after swimming or other activities that allow water into the ears. What causes swimmer's ear? Swimmer's ear develops because moisture in the ear canal encourages the growth of certain bacteria. The moisture also causes the skin that lines the ear canal to soften (like the white, swollen area that forms under a wet bandage). The bacteria then invade the softened skin and multiply there, causing this often painful infection. For reasons that are not clear, some children are more prone to swimmer's ear than others. Injury to the ear canal (sometimes from the improper use of cotton swabs) or conditions such as  eczema  and seborrheic dermatitis can make a child more likely to get swimmer's ear. What are symptoms of swimmer's ear? With the mildest form of swimmer's ear, your child will com­plain only of itchiness or a plugged feeling in the ear. If your child is too young to tell you what's bothering them, you might notice them sticking their finger in their ear or rubbing it with their hand. Within hours to days the opening of their ear canal may become swollen and slightly red, causing a dull pain. If you push on the opening or pull up on their ear, it may be painful. In more severe cases of swimmer's ear, the pain will be constant and intense. Your child may cry and hold their hand over their ear. The slightest motion, even chewing, will hurt a lot. The ear canal opening may be swollen shut, with a few drops of pus or cheesy material oozing out. Your child may also have a low-grade fever (rarely more than one or two degrees above normal). In the most serious infections, the redness and swelling may spread beyond the ear canal to the entire outer ear.  How is swimmer's ear treated? If your child has pain in his ear, or if you suspect swimmer's ear, call your pediatrician. Although the condition usually isn't serious, it still needs to be examined and treated by a doctor. Until you see your pediatrician, you can help relieve your child's pain with  acetaminophen  or ibuprofen. Keep your child out of the water for several days, and see if the pain subsides. Do not insert a cotton swab or anything else into the ear in an attempt to relieve itching or promote drainage; this will only cause further skin damage and provide more places for bacteria to grow. What medicine is prescribed for swimmer's ear? At the pediatrician's office, the doctor first will examine the affected ear. Then, they may carefully clean out pus and debris from the canal. Most doctors also prescribe ear drops for five to seven days. The eardrops fight infection. By doing this, they also decrease swelling, which helps to relieve the pain.In order to be effective, however, eardrops have to be used properly. (See \" How to Give Ear Drops to a Child .\")  If the ear canal is too swollen for drops to enter, your pediatrician may insert an ear wick—a small piece of cotton or spongy material that soaks up the medicine and holds it in the canal. In this case, you'll need to resaturate the wick with the drops three or four times per day. Rarely, oral antibiotics also are prescribed. Can you go swimming with swimmer's ear? When your child is being treated for swimmer's ear, your doctor may recommend they stay out of the water for a few days. However, they can take brief showers or baths daily and have his hair washed, as long as you dry the ear canal afterward with the corner of a towel or a blow-dryer (on a very low setting, held away from the ear). Once that's done, put in more eardrops.  How do you prevent swimmer's ear? There's no need to try to prevent swimmer's ear unless your child has had this infection frequently or very recently. Under these circumstances, limit his stays in the water, usually to less than an hour. Then, when they come out, remove the excess water from their ear with the corner of a towel, or have them shake their head.  Swimmer's ear home remedy: vinegar rinse A mixture of half white vinegar and half rubbing alcohol can be a practical and effective home remedy to help prevent swimmer's ear. A few drops in each ear can be used after swimming. To avoid injury, resist the temptation to clean out your child's ear with cotton swabs, your finger or any other object. Many pediatricians recommend acetic acid eardrops to help prevent swimmer's ear. They are available in various preparations, some of which need a prescription. They usually are used in the morning, at the end of each swim, and at bedtime.",

        "content": "Lymph glands (or lymph nodes) are an important part of the body’s defense system against infection and illness. These glands normally contain groups of cells, called lymphocytes, which act as barriers to infection. The lymphocytes produce substances called antibodies that destroy or immobilize infecting cells or poisons. When lymph glands become enlarged or swollen, it usually means that the lymphocytes have increased in number due to an infection or other illness and that they are being called into action to produce extra antibodies. Rarely, swollen glands, particularly if long-lasting and without other signs of inflammation, such as redness or tenderness, may indicate a tumor. \t If your child has swollen glands, you’ll be able to feel them or actually see the swelling. They also may be tender to the touch. Often, if you look near the gland, you can find the infection or injury that has caused it to swell. For example, a sore throat often will cause glands in the neck to swell, or an infection on the arm will produce swollen glands under the arm. Sometimes the illness may be a generalized one, such as those caused by a virus, in which case many glands might be slightly swollen. In general, because children have more viral infections than adults, lymph nodes, particularly in the neck, are more likely to be enlarged. Swollen glands at the base of the neck and just above the collarbone may be an infection or even a tumor within the chest, and should be examined by a physician as soon as possible.\t Treatment\t In the vast majority of cases, swollen glands are not serious. Lymph node swelling usually disappears after the illness that caused it is gone. The glands gradually return to normal over a period of weeks. You should call the pediatrician if your child shows any of the following:\t Lymph glands swollen and tender for more than five days\t Fever higher than 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 degrees Celsius)\t Glands that appear to be swollen throughout the body\t Tiredness, lethargy, or loss of appetite\t Glands that enlarge rapidly, or the skin overlying them turning red or purple\t As with any infection, if your child has a fever or is in pain, you can give her acetaminophen in the appropriate dosage for her weight and age until you can see the pediatrician. When you call, your doctor probably will ask you some questions to try to determine the cause of the swelling, so it will help if you do a little investigating beforehand. For instance, if the swollen glands are in the jaw or neck area, check if your child’s teeth are tender or her gums are inflamed, and ask her if there is any soreness in her mouth or throat. Mention to your doctor any exposure your child has had to animals (especially cats) or wooded areas. Also check for any recent animal scratches, tick bites, or insect bites or stings that may have become infected.\t The treatment for swollen glands will depend on the cause. If there’s a specific bacterial infection in nearby skin or tissue, antibiotics will clear it, allowing the glands gradually to return to their normal size. If the gland itself has an infection, it may require not only antibiotics but also warm compresses to localize the infection, followed by surgical drainage. If this is done, the material obtained from the wound will be cultured to determine the exact cause of the infection.\t Doing this will help the doctor choose the most appropriate antibiotic. If your pediatrician cannot find the cause of the swelling, or if the swollen glands don’t improve after antibiotic treatment, further tests will be needed. For example, infectious mononucleosis might be the problem if your child has a fever and a bad sore throat (but not strep), is very weak, and has swollen (but not red, hot, or tender) glands, although mononucleosis occurs more often in older children. Special tests can confirm this diagnosis. In cases where the cause of a swollen gland is unclear, the pediatrician also may want to do a tuberculosis skin test.\t If the cause of prolonged swelling of lymph nodes cannot be found in any other way, it may be necessary to perform a biopsy (remove a piece of tissue from the gland) and examine it under a microscope. In rare cases this may reveal a tumor or fungus infection, which would require special treatment.\t Prevention\t The only swollen glands that are preventable are those that are caused by bacterial infections in the surrounding tissue. In cases of suspected infection, you can avoid involving the lymph nodes by properly cleaning all wounds and receiving early antibiotic treatment.",

        "content": "Sinusitis is an inflammation of the lining of the nose and sinuses. It is a very common infection in children.\t Viral sinusitis  usually accompanies a cold. Allergic sinusitis may accompany allergies such as  hay fever . \t Bacterial sinusitis  is a secondary infection caused by the trapping of bacteria in the sinuses during the course of a  cold or allergy .\t General Characteristics of Viral Colds  It is often difficult to tell if an illness is just a viral cold or if it is complicated by a bacterial infection of the sinuses.  Colds usually last only 5 to 10 days.\t Colds typically start with clear, watery nasal discharge. After a day or 2, it is normal for the nasal discharge to become thicker and white, yellow, or green. After several days, the discharge becomes clear again and dries.\t Colds include a daytime cough that often gets worse at night.\t If a fever is present, it is usually at the beginning of the cold and is generally low grade, lasting for 1 or 2 days.\t Cold symptoms usually peak in severity at 3 or 5 days, then improve and disappear over the next 7 to 10 days.\t Signs and Symptoms of Bacterial Sinusitis: \t Cold symptoms (nasal discharge, daytime cough, or both) lasting more than 10 days without improving\t Thick yellow nasal discharge and a fever for at least 3 or 4 days in a row\t A severe  headache  behind or around the eyes that gets worse when bending over\t Swelling and dark circles around the eyes, especially in the morning\t Persistent  bad breath  along with cold symptoms (However, this also could be from a sore throat or a sign that your child is not brushing his teeth!)\t In very rare cases, a bacterial sinus infection may spread to the eye or the central nervous system (the brain). If your child has the following symptoms, call your pediatrician immediately:\t Swelling and/or redness around the eyes, not just in the morning but all day\t Severe headache and/or pain in the back of the neck\t Persistent vomiting\t Sensitivity to light\t Increasing irritability\t Diagnosing bacterial sinusitis\t It may be difficult to tell a sinus infection from an uncomplicated cold, especially in the first few days of the illness. Your pediatrician will most likely be able to tell if your child has bacterial sinusitis after examining your child and hearing about the progression of symptoms. In older children, when the diagnosis is uncertain, your pediatrician may order  computed tomographic (CT) scans  to confirm the diagnosis. \t Treating Bacterial Sinusitis\t If your child has bacterial sinusitis, your pediatrician may prescribe an antibiotic for at least 10 days. Once your child is on the medication, symptoms should start to go away over the next 2 to 3 days—the nasal discharge will clear and the cough will improve. Even though your child may seem better, continue to give the antibiotics for the prescribed length of time. Ending the medications too early could cause the infection to return.\t When a diagnosis of sinusitis is made in children with cold symptoms lasting more than 10 days without improving, some doctors may choose to continue observation for another few days. If your child's symptoms worsen during this time or do not improve after 3 days, antibiotics should be started.\t If your child's symptoms show no improvement 2 to 3 days after starting the antibiotics, talk with your pediatrician. Your child might need a different medication or need to be re-examined.\t Treating Related Symptoms of Bacterial Sinusitis\t Headache or sinus pain . To treat headache or  sinus pain , try placing a warm washcloth on your child's face for a few minutes at a time. Pain medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen may also help. (However, do not give your child aspirin. It has been associated with a rare but potentially fatal disease called  Reye syndrome .)\t Nasal congestion . If the secretions in your child's nose are especially thick, your pediatrician may recommend that you help drain them with saline nose drops. These are available without a prescription or can be made at home by adding 1/4 teaspoon of table salt to an 8-ounce cup of water. Unless advised by your pediatrician, do not use nose drops that contain medications because they can be absorbed in amounts that can cause side effects.\t Placing a cool-mist humidifier in your child's room may help keep your child more comfortable. Clean and dry the humidifier daily to prevent bacteria or mold from growing in it (follow the instructions that came with the humidifier). Hot water vaporizers are not recommended because they can cause scalds or burns.\t Remember\t If your child has symptoms of a bacterial sinus infection, see your pediatrician. Your pediatrician can properly diagnose and treat the infection and recommend ways to help alleviate the discomfort from some of the symptoms. \t Additional Information\t Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Acute Bacterial Sinusitis in Children Aged 1 to 18 Years  (AAP Clinical Practice Guideline)",

        "content": "Bells may be ringing this holiday season, but your kids' ears shouldn't be!\t Hearing loss  that results from exposure to loud noise, called   noise-induced hearing loss, is of special concern for today's children. One of the main reasons is the widespread use of personal audio technology and other smart devices. When not used safely, ear buds or  headphones  can present a significant danger to a child's hearing. Of course, these devices and accessories also happen to top many holiday wish lists. Beyond tech gifts, other holiday hearing hazards include noisy toys for the youngest of children and noisy gatherings such as parties and concerts. T he World Health Organization says  more than 1 billion  young people worldwide are at risk for hearing loss due to unsafe listening practices.  The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) also recently  sounded the alarm  on excessive noise risks to kids.  We've teamed up with the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association to offer the following tips. You can use them to help protect your kids' hearing from  too much noise  while enjoying the best of the holidays.  Noisy technology Earbuds and headphones, tablets and smartphones, and other electronic gifts such as gaming consoles and karaoke machines can reach dangerously high sound levels. That's why it is critical to use them safely:\t Monitor & teach safe listening.  Be attuned to the volume of what your kids are listening to. As a general rule, have them keep devices to half volume or less and take listening breaks every hour, especially when using earbuds or headphones. Even a few minutes of quiet will help their ears recover.\t Model good listening habits . As a parent, it is critical that you be a good role model when it comes to safe listening. Little ears are listening.\t Choose wisely . Certain features or products may help with volume control. Noise-cancelling headphones and earbuds can be a good idea, as kids won't need to turn the volume up to drown out outside noise.\t Pay attention to fit.  Look for ear buds or headphones that fit the child well, which will prevent sound leakage and again reduce the need to turn the volume up to hear. Need a practical tip? At an arm's length away, your child wearing headphones should still be able to hear you when asked a question. Question \"kid safe\" headphones & other products.  You may see headphones and other electronics marketed as \"kid safe\" because they cap the maximum sound output at a lower volume than typical. But some of these products still exceed a safe listening volume (75 decibels). Read the product descriptions closely. Also, listen yourself to decide if it sounds too loud. Noisy toys Toys designed for infants and toddlers may be noisy enough to cause hearing damage—especially since young children hold objects close to their face/ears.\t Check your list.  Before heading to the toy store or shopping online, check the Sight & Hearing Association's latest noisy toys  list. \t Listen up before purchasing.  Pay attention to how loud a toy sounds, and consider a different option, if necessary.\t Make a minor do-it-yourself modification.  An easy way to reduce the noise is to put a piece of tape over the speaker. Another option is to remove the batteries. Instantly, you've made the toy a much safer product for your child's ears. Noisy environments & events Holiday parties, concerts, shows, and other gatherings are part of the season. Make sure to be mindful of the noise level.\t Use hearing protection.  Bring earplugs offer good protection for most teens and adults when there is potential for loud noise. This is a cheap, easy, and effective way to preserve kids' (and adults') hearing. Young children should wear well-fitting earmuffs instead of earplugs, as earplugs can be a choking hazard.\t Keep a distance from noise sources.  Don't let kids stand near speakers or other noise sources. Try to stand at least 500 feet away from noise sources, such as a speaker or a stage.\t Leave if noise is enough to cause discomfort.  Ringing and pain are signs that ears need a break. If your child is complaining, covering their ears, or seems uncomfortable, consider an early exit.\t Download a sound-level meter app.  There are many free apps available to measure noise levels.    Here  is one example.\t Leave if noise is enough to cause discomfort.  Ringing and pain are signs that ears need a break. If your child is complaining, covering their ears, or seems uncomfortable, consider an early exit. Preventable, but irreversible, effects on hearing Unlike some other forms of hearing loss, noise-induced hearing changes   are preventable. However, once it occurs, it is irreversible. Roughly 15% of school-age children in the United States have hearing loss in one or both ears. Left unaddressed, hearing loss can lead to academic, social and behavioral problems. Concerned about your child's hearing? Even minor hearing loss can significantly impact a child's development, academic success, and social interactions among other effects. It's important that you act early if you have concern. Learn the early signs of hearing loss and schedule a hearing evaluation.  Visit  http://IdentifytheSigns.org  for more information about hearing loss and ways to support children who are deaf and hard-of-hearing.

        "content": "The tonsils produce antibodies when the body is fighting infection. Like the tonsils, the adenoid is part of your child's defense against infections. Read on to learn tonsillitis, signs of an enlarged adenoid and tonsils, and when surgery is recommended. What are the tonsils and adenoid? If you look into your child's throat, you may see a pink, oval-shaped mass on each side. These are the tonsils. The tonsils are small in infants and increase in size over the early years of childhood. They produce antibodies during periods when the body is fighting infection. Like the tonsils, the adenoid is part of your child's defense against infections. The adenoid is located in the very upper part of the throat, above the uvula and behind the nose. The adenoid can be seen only with special instruments passed through the nose or mouth, or indirectly by X-ray. What is tonsillitis? A common illness associated with the tonsils is tonsillitis. This is an inflammation of the tonsils usually due to an infection. Sometimes, tonsils can be enlarged and not be infected. However, most of the time there is an infection that has caused them to be larger than normal. Symptoms of tonsillitis There are several signs and syptoms of tonsillitis, including: Red and swollen tonsils White or yellow coating over the tonsils A \"throaty\" voice Sore throat Uncomfortable or painful swallowing Swollen lymph nodes (\"glands\") in the neck Fever Symptoms of an enlarged adenoid  It is not always easy to tell when your child's adenoid is enlarged. Some children are born with a larger adenoid. Others may have temporary enlargement of their adenoid due to colds or other infections; this is especially common among young children. Also, chronic rhinitis (a persistent runny nose) is more frequently the cause of these symptoms, and can be treated with corticosteroid nasal sprays. But the constant swelling or enlargement of the adenoid can cause other health problems, such as ear and sinus infections. Some signs of an enlarged adenoid include: Breathing through the mouth instead of the nose most of the time Nose sounds \"blocked\" when the child talks Noisy breathing during the day Snoring at night When both the tonsils and adenoid enlarged Both the tonsils and the adenoid may be enlarged if your child has the above symptoms along with any of the following: Breathing stops for a short at night during snoring or loud breathing (this condition is called sleep apnea) Choking or gasping during sleep Difficulty swallowing, especially solid foods A constant \"throaty voice,\" even when there is no tonsillitis In severe cases, your child may have such difficulty breathing. It can interfere with the normal exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in his lungs. This is important to recognize since it may interrupt your child's normal sleep pattern. If your child has severe breathing difficulties, seems drowsy during waking hours, and lacks energy despite what should have been adequate amounts of sleep, consult your pediatrician; when breathing problems are severe, call 911. If your child shows the signs and symptoms of enlarged tonsils or adenoid, and doesn't seem to be getting better over a period of weeks, mention it to your pediatrician. Does my child need their tonsils or adenoid taken out? There are two types of operations: tonsillectomy (surgery to remove the tonsils) and adenoidectomy (surgery to remove the adenoid). Although these two operations (often combined and called T & A) were done almost routinely in the past and remain one of the most common major operations performed on children, not until recently has their long-term effectiveness been adequately tested. In light of current studies, today's physicians are much more conservative in recommending these procedures, even though some children still need to have their tonsils and/or adenoid taken out.  Your pediatrician may recommend surgery if:  Tonsil or adenoid swelling makes normal breathing difficult (causing problems such as behavioral issues, bed-wetting, sleep apnea, school performance problems, etc.). Tonsils are so swollen that your child has a problem swallowing. An enlarged adenoid makes breathing uncomfortable, severely alters speech, and possibly affects normal growth of the face. In this case, surgery to remove only the adenoid may be recommended. The child has an excessive number of severe sore throats each year. What if my child needs surgery?  If your child needs surgery, make sure they knows what will happen before, during, and after surgery. Don't keep the surgery a secret from your child. An operation can be scary, but it's better to be honest than to leave your child with fears and unanswered questions.   The hospital m​ay have a special program to help you and your child get familiar with the hospital and the surgery. If the hospital allows, try to stay with your child during the entire hospital visit. Let your child know that you'll be nearby during the entire operation. Your pediatrician also can help you and your child understand the operation and make it less frightening. More information Strep Throat, Sore Throat or Tonsillitis: What's the Difference?

        "content": "By: John E. McClay, MD, FAAP Finding a lump on your child's neck can be alarming but neck masses are very common in children and usually harmless.  A swollen spot on the neck is often an enlarged lymph node, for example, a sign your child's immune system is fighting off an infection.  Always have any lumps, bumps or swelling on your child's neck checked.  Your child's pediatrician will check to see the lump's size, location, firmness, and ask you about:  the legnth of time it has been there  whether your child has been sick or has other symptoms of infection  whether your child has been near pets or other animals, or has been outside the country     Most lumps found in a child's neck are enlarged lymph nodes caused by an infection.    Lymph nodes are part of the immune system and help rid the body of harmful bacteria, viruses, and other causes of irritation or infection. There are 200 to 300 lymph nodes in the back of the nose, throat, and neck. They may swell when you child's body is fighting a  common cold  or  strep throat , for example.  ​Lumps on the neck may also be an infection of the lymph node itself, or in other nearby spots. Diagnosis and treatment of infections of the neck:\t The most common infections of the neck are viral or bacterial and some can be treated with  antibiotics . In certain types of “atypical” or unusual neck infections, a child may not seem that sick but the infected lumps seem to worsen. They may also be changes in the color and consistency of the overlying skin.  The most common type of atypical lymph node infection is non-tuberculosis mycobacterium and may need surgery, or take months to improve. \t If your child does not respond to antibiotics or seems especially sick, has a high or prolonged  fever  and redness of the skin over the lump, your pediatrician may recommend: IV antibiotics, which treat infections more quickly because they go directly into the bloodstream. A visit to the  emergency department  or stay in the hospital will also make it easier to monitor your child. Lab or  imaging tests , often either ultrasound or computer tomography (CT scan), to determine how severe the infection is. In rare cases, a needle biopsy might also be done to help identify the cause of the infection. Surgical draining. If antibiotics alone do not clear up the infection, sometimes it may need to be drained using a needle or surgical instruments such as a scalpel or lancet. Not all neck lumps are related to an infection.  The lump could be from different types of cysts, abnormal growths of blood vessels, scar tissue or--rarely--tumors or cancer. Location, consistency, and color of the lump or skin around it can give clues as to what it might be.  Congenital cysts It is common for young children to have small neck cysts—benign (non-cancerous) pockets of tissue that formed before birth and can grow larger over time.  These are called congenital cysts.  They can cause repeated infections and may need to be removed surgically. \t Common types of congenital cysts:   \t \t \t Thyroglossal duct cysts  are the most common type of congenital neck cyst. They are usually located in the front of the neck, formed from cells leftover after the thyroid gland develops in the womb.\t Branchial cleft cysts  form when sections of the head and neck don't come together exactly right before birth. They often are located below one or both ears or in the sides of the neck. These cysts may not be noticeable until later in childhood or adolescence.\t Dermoid cysts  can happen when layers of skin do not form properly during fetal development. These slow growing cysts may contain trapped sweat glands, hair follicles and other types of cells normally found in skin. Deep hemangiomas Sometimes neck lumps are a type of birthmark called      hemangiomas , growth of blood vessels under a child's skin. They may be noticeable when a baby is born and enlarge quickly by the first birthday. Deep hemangiomas can feel squishy than cysts, and the skin over them may look reddish. Although they often go away by the time a child reaches school age, your pediatrician may recommend treatment if it starts to cause grow rapidly or cause other symptoms. Torticollis \"pseudotumor\" Some babies with      torticollis , a tightness on one side of the neck, develop a      pseudotumor  on the large muscle that connects the head, neck, and breastbone. The bump is often made up of scar tissue where the muscle was injured in the womb or during birth. It usually becomes noticeable between birth and 8 weeks of age. Your pediatrician may provide a referral for physical therapy that includes gentle heat, massage and passive stretching. Malignant masses Rarely, a neck lump may be a sign of      childhood cancer . The most common types of childhood cancers of the neck include lymphoma, neuroblastoma, sarcoma, or thyroid tumors. A needle biopsy can help with the diagnosis, or the lump may need to be surgically removed to exam the cells under a microscope.\t For more information, watch this video from the American Society of Pediatric Otolaryngology:\t  \t   In this video, Amy R. Coffey, MD, FAAP, Assistant Professor of Pediatric Otolaryngology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, explains why swollen glands and other neck lumps can be caused by many different things, including illness, infection, or injury. She also reviews the various signs, symptoms, and treatment options.\t   Remember Talk with your pediatrician if you notice a lump on your child's neck. Identifying the cause of the lump will help determine the best decisions about treatment, if any is needed.

        "content": "​​​By: Nicole Bentley, MD & Caroline Paul, MD, FAAP Sore throats are common in kids. However, it can be difficult to sort out when your child has a sore throat that will get better on its own, or one caused by a more serious infection. Here's some information on common infections that may include a sore throat. The Common Cold Sore throats are most often caused by a viral infection like the  common cold . These illnesses show up more commonly during winter but can happen year-round. In addition to a sore, scratchy throat, a cold virus can cause your child to have a  fever , runny nose and cough. Antibiotics will not help a sore throat caused by a  virus . These infections usually get better without medication in 7 to 10 days. The best way to  care for a cold  and sore throat is to help keep your child comfortable and make sure he or she gets plenty of fluids and rest.  Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease Hand, foot, and mouth disease  is caused by a family of viruses called  enteroviruses . This infection most often spreads among young children during summer and fall, although cases may occur year-round. Early symptoms may include fever and sore throat or mouth pain, followed by a rash that appears as a mix of small red bumps and blisters, particularly on the hands, feet, buttocks, and around the mouth. Blisters and sores may form in the mouth and throat, making it painful to swallow. As with other viruses, antibiotics will not help this type of sore throat. Your pediatrician may recommend  acetaminophen  or  ibuprofen  for the fever and pain, along with fluids and rest at home until the blisters heal. Strep Throat Strep throat  is an infection caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. It's most commonly seen among children 5 to 15 years old, usually during winter and early spring. Only 20% to 30% of throat infections in school age children are caused by strep throat. Symptoms include sore throat, pus on the tonsils, difficulty swallowing, fever, and swollen glands. Children may also complain of headaches, stomachaches, and may develop a red, sandpaper-like rash on their bodies. Cough and runny nose are NOT typical symptoms of strep throat among older children. Strep throat is extremely uncommon in infants and toddlers. When they do get strep, though, their symptoms may be different. Your pediatrician will prescribe antibiotic medicine for strep throat.   Why is it important to know the difference? The cause of sore throats in children usually is viral infections, which do not benefit from antibiotics and go away on their own. Children with strep throat also may also recover without antibiotics. However, antibiotics can speed up recovery time, reduce contagiousness, and lower the risk of developing certain complications from strep throat. The most important complications to avoid include acute rheumatic fever, a disease that can damage the heart and joints. Antibiotics are important for treating bacterial infections like strep throat but have their own  risks , including diarrhea, yeast infections, allergic reactions, and the development of  antibiotic resistance . That's why it is important to know when antibiotics are necessary for sore throat and when they are not.  Sore Throat: Diagnosis & Treatment Your pediatrician can diagnose a sore throat caused by a virus after examining your child and ruling out a bacterial infection. The best way to care for a sore throat caused by a virus is to  keep your child comfortable   and making sure they get plenty of fluids and rest. Your pediatrician may recommend  acetaminophen  or  ibuprofen  to relieve the fever and pain. For hand, foot and mouth disease, which is highly contagious, your child should stay home until the blisters begin to heal. If your pediatrician is concerned about a possible strep throat infection, he or she may swab the back of your child's throat to collect a test sample. Most pediatric clinics can do a rapid strep test, which gives results within about 10-15 minutes and can detect most cases of strep throat. If this test is negative, the pediatrician may send the sample to a lab where they will try to grow the bacteria. If either test is positive, your child may be diagnosed with strep throat. If both tests are negative, your child does not have strep throat.  Preventing Illnesses that Cause Sore Throat The viruses and bacteria that cause a sore throat are passed from person to person through droplets of moisture in the air (from a sneeze or cough) or on the hands of someone who is infected. The illnesses may spread through schools and child care centers. One challenge for prevention is that people are often most contagious before they even begin to have symptoms.  Washing hands , covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or upper arm (rather than hand), cleaning toys, and not sharing drinking cups is the best way to try to prevent the spread of illness. When to Call the Pediatrician   If your child complains of a sore throat that does not improve over the course of the day―especially after drinking water―you should call your pediatrician. This is especially true if there there's a fever, headache, stomachache, drooling (because it hurts to swallow), or  signs of dehydration . Your child's pediatrician may want him or her to come in for to determine if a strep test is needed. If your child tests negative for strep throat or if your pediatrician does not think your child needs a throat swab, that is great news. Your child most likely has a virus that will get better with time. However, if his or her symptoms don't get better after 3 to 5 days, or if they develop other symptoms such as an earache or a new fever, he or she should see the pediatrician again to determine if more tests are needed.

        "content": "For the first time, certain hearing aids are now being sold in drug stores and online without any involvement of a medical professional. These   over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids have created a lot of excitement as a more affordable option to help people with hearing loss.  While OTC hearing aids can benefit some people, it's important to know that they are not meant for children. In fact, for kids, they can actually be harmful. Read on to learn why, and how to find better options to treat your child's hearing loss.   How common is hearing loss in children? In the United States, roughly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 babies are born with  hearing loss . That makes it the most common congenital health condition that can be screened at birth. By the time children reach school age (6–19 years), almost 15% have some degree of hearing loss. There are  many different reasons  why a child may be born with or acquire a hearing loss later in life.  Options to help kids with hearing loss Families have options for helping their child with hearing loss communicate effectively. For example, there is technology that can improve a child's ability to access sound, including prescription hearing aids, cochlear implants and personal  FM systems .  The  U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  is clear that OTC hearing aids are only for adults ages 18 and older. But this may not be obvious when you see them on store shelves or in advertisements. And the FDA does not require that retailers verify the age of the buyer or user to be sure they are 18 years or older.  Families may be tempted to purchase these products for their child, especially if their insurance doesn't cover hearing aids. However, this should never be considered an option for children—even if families have difficulty paying for a prescription hearing aid. There are other sources of help (see \"What can I do if hearing aids aren't covered by my insurance?\" below).  How can OTC hearing aids be harmful to children? OTC hearing aids are designed for people ages 18 years or older. Because of this, certain essential components of pediatric hearing aids that protect children will not   be included in these products.  Necessary features for children's hearing aids include:  Tamper-proof battery doors:  Children are naturally curious and will want to explore their hearing aids. Pediatric prescription hearing aids come with a tamper-proof battery door to prevent younger children from gaining access to the battery. Without this feature, kids can swallow the battery. Recent studies have shown that hospitalizations of kids who have ingested  lithium coin batteries and button batteries  are rising. This can result serious injuries, damage to vital organs, and even death.    Child-appropriate size:  A prescription pediatric hearing aid is designed for a child's small ear, which is still growing. Placing an adult-sized OTC hearing aid into a child's ear may result in more hearing loss due to over-amplification. Consistent over-amplification, which means a hearing aid is making sound louder than a child's hearing loss requires, can have other physical effects such as headaches. This can influence a child's ability to concentrate and function in their daily lives.    Specialized testing:  An  audiologist  (healthcare professional who specializes in the assessment and management of hearing loss) who provides a prescription hearing aid to a child uses multiple tools to make sure that the hearing aid is a good fit for them. This includes use of specialized equipment and testing in a sound booth. These measures ensure that the child is getting the best access to the full range of speech.  A child's hearing levels, and anatomy of each ear are unique. That's why age-appropriate testing is important. An audiologist confirms that the hearing aid is giving out just the right amount of sound needed for the pitches that are important for understanding speech and learning spoken languages. A poorly fit OTC hearing aid might actually make it harder for a child to learn language. This increases the achievement gap compared to their hearing classmates over time.    Volume-safe design:  Prescription hearing aids have sophisticated sound processing capabilities that automatically adjust to a child's hearing needs in the moment. These needs can change throughout the day based on factors such as background noise in a room or the activity they are participating in (for example, sitting in class versus watching  television ).  Audiologists often disable the volume adjustment buttons on hearing aids to keep children from manually changing the volume. OTC hearing aids are required to have a volume-control feature and there may be no way to disable this feature on many products. Children may turn the up the volume  too loud . This puts them at risk for  noise exposure  and additional hearing loss. There is also a risk a child might turn the volume all the way down, further reducing their access to sounds.    Connection to school equipment:  A hearing aid is only one tool that a child uses to connect to their world. In the school setting, many children sync their hearing aid to equipment in the classroom, such as an FM system. This helps them hear the teacher better and keep up with the curriculum. Hearing aids alone are not enough in a noisy classroom or when the teacher is talking at a distance from the child. OTC hearing aids will not be designed to connect to these types of equipment, putting the child at a disadvantage educationally.    Why is addressing a child's hearing loss so important? Untreated hearing loss can have a big impact on a child's speech and spoken language development. Children with hearing loss who use hearing aids in early childhood show faster growth in  spoken language skills  compared to children who do not use hearing aids. Early language delays can have a cascading impact on literacy and school success.  Even a \"mild\" hearing loss may result in a child missing daily language and learning opportunities from birth throughout their school years. This can affect  achievement  in all subjects if left unaddressed. Children with untreated hearing loss can also experience social and behavioral challenges. They may miss parts of conversations or social cues—making it difficult to make or keep friends. This can lead to feelings of loneliness or isolation. Difficulty hearing and communicating may also lead a child to feel frustrated, causing them to act out in school and other settings.  The academic, social and behavioral consequences of untreated hearing loss can impact a child's future career options and success. What are the signs of hearing loss—and what should I do if I am concerned about my child? Signs and symptoms of hearing loss can be different for every child. Even if your child passed a hearing screening, they still may develop hearing problems later in childhood. Signs to watch for include, but are not limited to, the following: Not startling to loud noises ( birth  to 3 months) Trouble locating where sound is coming from (7 months to 1 year) Delay in speech/language development (7 months to 1 year) Difficulty following directions (school age) Sudden change in academic performance (school age) Unexplained behavioral problems or \"tuning out\" (school age) Listening to the entertainment devices at loud volumes (school age) Any reports of strange sounds in the child's ear, e.g., bees buzzing (school age) If you are concerned about your child's hearing, ask your pediatrician for a referral to an audiologist in your area. Audiologists have special tests to evaluate hearing at any age (from newborns to adolescents). Depending on the child's age, the method and equipment for evaluating their hearing may be different. This is why it's important to see these specialists if you have concerns. You can also find audiologists through online searchable databases including  EHDI-PALS  and  ASHA ProFind .    Empty heading What can I do if hearing aids aren't covered by my insurance? Unfortunately, not all insurance plans cover children's hearing aids. If your family is in this situation, consider the following: Know your rights. Some states require insurance providers to cover hearing aids for children (though some providers still may be exempt). You can find a state-by-state list with specific requirements from the American-Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) here:  https://www.asha.org/advocacy/state/issues/ha_reimbursement/#GA If your child qualifies for insurance through Medicaid, know that the Medicaid law requires coverage of hearing services including funding for hearing aids. Learn more about here:  https://www.asha.org/public/coverage/medicaid/ Explore funding assistance pages for hearing aids from national hearing organizations.   ASHA:   https://www.asha.org/public/coverage/p4audfundingresources/ Hearing Loss Association of America:   https://www.hearingloss.org/hearing-help/financial-assistance/   Talk with your child's audiologist about your financial assistance needs. They are often familiar with local, state, or private programs that could assist your family with funding for your child's hearing aids.

        "content": "Although we usually think of cataracts as affecting elderly people, they also can affect infants and young children. Sometimes, they may be present at birth (congenital). While rare, congenital cataracts are  a leading cause of visual loss and blindness in children.  What is a cataract? A cataract is a clouding of the lens (the transparent tissue inside the eye that helps bring light rays to focus on the retina). A cataract usually shows up as a white reflection in the center of the child's pupil. Cataracts in children need to be detected and treated early so their vision can develop properly.  How are cataracts treated in children? If a baby is born with a cataract that blocks most of the light entering the eye, the affected lens has to be removed surgically to let the baby's vision to develop.  Most    pediatric ophthalmologists  recommend that this procedure be performed during the first month after birth. After the clouded lens is removed, the baby must be fitted with a contact lens or with an eyeglass correction. At the age of about two years, the placement of a lens implant within the eye is recommended. In addition, visual rehabilitation of the affected eye will almost always involve using a patch on the opposite eye until the child's eyes are fully mature (at about age 10 years). Occasionally a child will be born with a small pinpoint cataract that, at first, will not affect visual development. These tiny cataracts often do not require treatment; however, they need to be monitored carefully to ensure that they do not become large enough to interfere with normal vision.  What causes cataracts? In many cases, the cause of cataracts in infants cannot be determined. Cataracts may be blamed on a tendency to inherit them from parents; they may result from trauma or injury to the eye; or they may occur as a result of viral infections such as German measles and chickenpox or an infection from other microorganisms, such as those that cause    toxoplasmosis  or    Zika .  What to know if you're pregnant To protect an unborn child from cataracts and from other serious disorders, take care to avoid unnecessary exposure to infectious diseases if you're pregnant. In addition, as a precaution against toxoplasmosis (a disease caused by parasites), avoid handling cat litter or eating raw meat, both of which may contain the organism that causes this disease.

        "content": "By: Dr. Christina L. Master, MD, FAAP, CAQSM, FACSM, FAMSSM \t   Concussions  are a type of injury that happens when a jolt to the head causes nerve cells in the brain to stretch. These injuries send more than a million U.S. children to emergency departments or doctor's offices each year. It is important to recognize the symptoms of concussion in order to seek prompt medical care, which can improve recovery.    You may be aware of common concussion symptoms such as headaches, dizziness and balance issues. However, many parents don't realize that vision problems are also common after concussion. In fact, the majority of children with concussion will experience vision-related symptoms. Here's what to watch for and how to help your child get needed care and accommodations as they recover. What kinds of vision symptoms can occur after concussion? Vision issues children may experience after concussion include:  blurry vision double vision difficulty reading eye strain or pain  difficulty focusing at near distance  Considering how much reading and other visual activities take place at school, these symptoms can have a big effect on a child's return to learning. Recognizing vision problems after a concussion is an important first step in tailoring school accommodations to support your child's return to learning.  How are vision problems identified after concussion? The doctor will ask specific questions about vision issues your child may be having and perform a physical exam that evaluates their eye movements. They may move their finger to have your child track a moving object or have them look back and forth between visual targets to see if it provokes concussion symptoms like headache, dizziness or eye fatigue. The doctor may also have your child move their head while trying to focus on a stationary target, since vision problems can be related to difficulty with motion sensitivity. Lastly, they may have your child focus on a visual target moving from far to near, with both eyes and with each eye individually. How do we manage visual problems at school after concussion? Early identification of vision issues after concussion makes it easier to tailor school accommodations. When returning back to the school setting, your child may need temporary supports such as: regular visual breaks to prevent visual fatigue larger font size when reading to help with difficulty focusing at near distance preprinted notes to temporarily limit the need to repeatedly adjust focus from far to near and back again preferred seating to make it easier to see what the teacher shows during lessons  How long do vision problems last after a concussion? Most vision problems after a concussion resolve on their own within a few weeks. However, some kids may continue to have vision issues beyond a month. In these cases, referral to a specialist with experience managing patients with concussion-related vision disorders can help. Health care professionals who specialize in concussion-related vision problems vary by location but may include sports medicine doctors, ophthalmologists, rehabilitation specialists or even otorhinolaryngologists (ear, nose and throat specialists), since vision problems can be associated with vestibular (inner ear canal) problems, such as balance or motion sensitivity.  Remember If you think your child may have a concussion, be sure to talk with your child's pediatrician about vision issues and how to address them after injury at your visit.

        "content": "By: Douglas R. Fredrick MD, FAAP   Stylish frames and tinted lenses have made eyeglasses more fun to wear. Even so, your child might want to switch to contact lenses at some point. How can you decide if they're ready for contacts? What healthy routines will they need to learn to prevent eye infections and other complications? Here's what parents and caregivers need to know about contact lenses and eye health for kids and teens.  Is it OK for kids to wear contacts?  For children with poor vision caused by refractive errors (problems with focusing), glasses are often the first choice. But many young people who    play sports  might prefer contacts, since they don't break as easily as frames and lenses. In some cases, eye doctors may recommend contacts to    slow the progression  of nearsightedness ( myopia ) in children aged 8 to 12.  How do contacts correct vision problems?  Contact lenses are thin, clear plastic discs that float on the    tear film  in your child's eye. Like eyeglasses, they correct blurry vision that happens when the eye does not bend or focus light properly. Contacts can be used to correct nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness ( hyperopia ) and distorted vision due to    astigmatism   (\"football shaped eyes\").  Types of contact lenses There are two types of contact lenses your eye doctor might recommend: Soft contact lenses , which are flexible and foldable Rigid gas permeable contact lenses , which are made from stiff plastic that cannot be folded.  While rigid gas-permeable lenses are a good choice for children with high amounts of astigmatism, most children prefer soft lenses for comfort and convenience.  Daily wear vs. extended wear contacts Daily wear contacts can be put in when your child wakes up and stored or even tossed away at bedtime. Extended wear contact lenses (lenses you can sleep in overnight) also are approved for use, but most ophthalmologists do not recommend them. This is because extended wear lenses are associated with a higher risk of eye infections that can cause permanent damage to vision.  How young is too young for contacts? Most eye care professionals agree that children as young as  8 years old  can safely use contact lenses. By this age, children can learn care routines that prevent eye infections and other concerns relating to contacts. Your child may be ready for contact lenses if they can: Easily follow directions and build new skills Do daily tasks without reminders Learn to keep lenses clean Follow a regular wear schedule  Handle lenses carefully so they don't break or tear What are the health risks of contacts for kids? Contact lenses do come with certain risks. The most common concerns are eye infections such as    keratitis . With keratitis, the cornea—the clear, dome-shaped surface of the eye—becomes infected. Keratitis can scar your child's cornea, harming their vision.  Kids who wear contacts can also develop    conjunctivitis , or pink eye. This happens when the blood vessels in the membrane that lines the eyelid and eyeball become swollen and irritated. Causes of eye infections in contact wearers may include: Using extended-wear lenses, which reduce the amount of oxygen that reaches the cornea. This makes it harder for the eye to fight off bacteria, fungi or parasites. Sleeping in contact lenses, which creates a warm, moist environment for bacteria to grow. Wearing contact lenses while swimming in  lakes  or  pools  where bacteria and parasites may be present. How can I help my child learn healthy contact lens habits? A few simple steps and routines can reduce the chances your child will develop serious eye problems from contact use.  Contact and eye care practices to help your child learn Wash hands with soap and water  and dry thoroughly with a clean towel before touching your contacts. Don't sleep in your contacts  unless your eye doctor approves you for extended-wear contacts. Keep your contacts away from  water .  This includes bottled, distilled or tap water, as well as lake, river or ocean water. Take your contacts out before swimming  or hanging out in a pool or hot tub. Disinfect your lens case every day  (or every time you store your lenses). Dry    out the contact lens case with a clean tissue  before refilling with fresh solution. (Never just \"top off\" the old solution in your lens case, since this can allow bacteria to linger and grow.)  Never use saliva or plain water  to clean, wet or store your lenses. Replace your lenses  as often as your eye doctor recommends. Replace your lens case  every 3 months or as often as your doctor recommends. Should my child have glasses as a backup? Since contact lenses can easily be lost or torn, it's smart to keep a pair of regular glasses on hand. This way, your child will be able to see well during school, sports practice or other activities while new lenses are on order. More safety tips for kids who wear contacts Pay attention to how your eyes feel.  Ask for help if you experience: Eye pain or discomfort Excess tearing or eye discharge  Unusual sensitivity to light  Itching, burning, swelling or grittiness  Blurred vision Never share contact lenses.  Don't wear your friends' contacts or loan yours to anyone else. Sharing contact lenses can raise the chances of infections that can cause serious vision problems. Don't wear cosmetic contact lenses. Decorative contact lenses  like those sold online during Halloween can harm your eyes. Only wear contact lenses prescribed and dispensed by your eyecare professional. Protect your eyes when wearing contacts. Wear sunglasses when in windy dusty conditions. Also, use  protective eyewear  with the contact lenses when participating in sports prone to eye injuries like racquetball, badminton, ice and field hockey.

        "content": "You may want to have the perfect look for    Halloween  or look like your favorite movie star or singer. But choosing to change the look of your eyes with contact lenses could cause a lot of damage to your eyesight if you get them without the input of your eye care professional. What are decorative contact lenses?  Decorative contact lenses change the look of your eyes. They may not correct your vision. They can temporarily change your brown eyes to blue or make your eyes look like cat eyes or vampire eyes for Halloween.  Decorative contact lenses are considered medical devices. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees their safety and effectiveness, just like regular contact lenses that correct your vision. Decorative contact lenses are sometimes called: Halloween contact lenses Fashion contact lenses Color contact lenses Cosmetic contact lenses Theatrical contact lenses What are the risks of decorative and Halloween contact lenses?  Wearing decorative contact lenses can be risky, just like the contact lenses that correct your vision. Wearing any kind of contact lenses, including decorative ones, can cause serious damage to your eyes if the lenses are obtained without a prescription or not used correctly. Problems from not using contact lenses correctly can include: A cut or scratch on the top layer of your eyeball ( corneal abrasion )\t Allergic reactions  like itchy, watery red eyes\t Decreased vision\t Infection Blindness\t When wearing any type of contact lenses, be aware of signs of possible eye infection such as:\t \t \t Redness\t Pain in the eye(s) that doesn't go away after a short period of time\t Decreased vision  \t   If you have any of these signs, you need to see a licensed eye doctor (optometrist or    opthalmologist ) right away! An eye infection could become serious and cause you to become blind if it is not treated. You can avoid some of these risks by getting any type of contact lenses from your eye doctor. Be sure to follow the directions for cleaning, disinfecting, and wearing the lenses that your doctor gives you. If your doctor doesn't give you any direction,    ask for them ! Do's and Don'ts of Decorative and Halloween Lenses  If you plan on wearing decorative contact lenses, even if only for a special event, make sure that you:\t DO get an eye exam.  A licensed eye doctor will examine your eyes to make sure the contact lenses fit properly. The fit of your contact lenses is very important. A wrong fit can cause damage to your eyes. Be sure to always go for follow-up eye exams.\t DO get a prescription.  Your eye doctor will write you a prescription for all contact lenses, including decorative lenses. The prescription should include the brand name, correct lens measurements, and expiration date.\t DO follow the contact lens care instructions.  Follow the instructions for wearing, cleaning, and disinfecting that come with your contact lenses. If you do not receive instructions, ask your eye doctor for them.\t DO seek medical attention right away and remove your contact lenses  if your eyes are red and have ongoing pain or discharge. Redness, pain and discharge from the eyes are signs of an eye infection. If you think you have an eye infection from your contact lenses, remove them and see an eye doctor right away.\t DON'T share your contact lenses with anyone else.   You wouldn't share your toothbrush, would you? All eyes are not the same size and shape; your contact lenses are fitted just for you.\t DON'T buy any contact lenses without a prescription.  If you don't see an eye doctor and get a prescription, the contact lenses you get may not fit properly and work well. They could even damage your eyes. Sometimes, wearing contact lenses can damage the top layer of your eyeball (cornea). Even if you aren't having any problems now, the lenses still could be causing damage to your eyes. By having regular checkups and buying contact lenses with a prescription, you will reduce the chance of any undetected damage to your eyes.  Buying decorative or Halloween contact lenses You can buy contact lenses, including decorative contact lenses, from your eye doctor, on the internet, or from a mail-order company. This includes foreign manufacturers or distributors of decorative lenses. It's very important that you only buy contact lenses from a company that sells    FDA-cleared or approved contact lenses  and requires you to provide a prescription. Anyone selling you contact lenses must get your prescription and verify it with your doctor. They should request not only the prescription, but the name of your doctor and their phone number. If they don't ask for this information, they are breaking federal law and could be selling you illegal contact lenses. Remember: buying contact lenses without a prescription is dangerous! Never buy contact lenses from a street vendor, a beauty supply store, flea market, novelty store or Halloween store, or from an unknown online distributor. They may be contaminated and/or counterfeit, and therefore not safe to use.  Even though there are a lot of products that you can buy without a prescription, contact lenses are not one of them. It's your job to make sure you protect your eyes by having an eye exam, getting a prescription, and buying contact lenses from a legal source.

Also known as pinkeye, this inflammation, which can be painful and itchy, usually signals an infection, but may be due to other causes, such as an irritation, an allergic reaction, or (rarely) a more serious condition. It's often accompanied by tearing and discharge, which is the body's way of trying to heal or remedy the situation. If your child has a red eye, he needs to see the pediatrician ​as soon as possible. Eye infections typically last seven to ten days. The doctor will make the diagnosis and prescribe necessary medication if it is indicated.      Never put previously opened medication or someone else's eye medication into your child's eye. It could cause serious damage. In a newborn baby: Serious eye infections may result from exposure to bacteria during passage through the birth canal—which is why all infants are treated with      antibiotic eye ointment or drops  in the delivery room. Such infections must be treated early to prevent serious complications.  Eye infections that occur after the newborn period: These infections may be unsightly, because of the redness of the eye and the yellow discharge that usually accompanies them, and they may make your child uncomfortable, but they are rarely serious. Several different viruses, or bacteria, may cause them. If your pediatrician feels the problem is caused by bacteria, antibiotic eye drops are the usual treatment. Conjunctivitis caused by viruses should not be treated with antibiotics. Eye infections are very contagious!  Except to administer drops or ointment, you should avoid direct contact with your child's eyes or drainage from them until the medication has been used for several days and there is evidence of clearing of the redness. Carefully wash your hands before and after touching the area around the infected eye.      See \t   How to Give Eye Drops and Eye Ointment .

        "content": "There are many different eye conditions and diseases that can affect a child's vision. If your pediatrician suspects an    eye condition  or if your child fails a    vision screening , the doctor can refer you to a    pediatric ophthalmologist  for further evaluation and diagnosis.  Early detection and treatment is so important to avoid lifelong visual impairments. Below, see some of the more common eye disorders and eye diseases and how they may be treated.\t Condition\t Description\t Treatment\t Astigmatism An irregularly shaped cornea that can cause blurred vision. Glasses if it causes blurred vision.\t Blocked Tear Duct   In babies with this condition, also called    nasolacrimal duct obstruction , the eyes overflow with tears and collect mucus. Gentle massage of the tear duct can help relieve the blockage. If that doesn't work, a tear duct-probing procedure or surgery may be needed.\t Cataract A clouding of the lens of the eye. About    3 out of 10,000  children have a cataract. Most cataracts must be surgically removed. Cataracts in babies and children are rare and usually not related to cataracts in adults.\t Chalazion A firm, painless bump on the    eyelid  due to a blocked oil gland. May resolve on its own or be treated with eye drops or warm compresses. In some cases, minor surgery may be needed.\t Droopy eyelids (ptosis) When the eyelids are not as open as they should be. This is caused by weakness in the muscle that opens the eyelid. If severe, it can cause poor vision development ( amblyopia ) and needed eyelid surgery.\t Falsely misaligned eyes (pseudostrabismus) Caused by a wide nasal bridge or extra folds of skin between the nose and eye. The eyes only appear    cross-eyed . None. The eyes should be monitored to be sure they remain healthy.\t Farsightedness (hypertopia) Difficulty seeing close objects. A small degree of farsightedness is normal in babies and children. If it becomes severe or causes the eyes to cross, glasses are needed.\t Glaucoma A condition in which the    pressure inside the eye  is too high. Warning signs are extreme sensitivity to light, tearing, persistent pain, an enlarged eye, cloudy cornea and lid spasm. Glaucoma in childhood usually needs surgery. If left untreated, glaucoma can cause blindness.\t Lazy eye (amblyopia) Reduced vision from lack of use in an otherwise normal eye. It's often caused by poor focusing or misaligned eyes. Applying a patch or special eye drops to the \"good\" eye. Other treatments commonly include glasses or eye muscle surgery for misaligned eyes.\t Misaligned eyes (strabismus) When one eye turns inward, upward, downward or outward. This is caused by eye muscles that do not work well together. Glasses, patches or surgery, depending on the cause for the misalignment.\t Nearsightedness (myopia) Difficulty seeing faraway objects. Nearsightedness is very rare in babies but becomes more common in school-aged children. Glasses are used to correct blurred distance vision. Once nearsighted, children do not usually outgrow the condition.    Contacts  may be worn when old enough.\t Pinkeye (conjunctivitis) A reddening of the white part of the eye, usually due to infections, allergies or irritation. Signs include tearing,    discharge  and feeling that there's something in the eye. Depending on its cause, pinkeye is often treated with eye drops or ointment. Frequent    hand washing  can limit the spread of eye infections to other family members and classmates.\t Scratched cornea (corneal abrasion) A scratch on the front surface of the eye (the    cornea ). It can be very painful. The eyes usually tear and are also sensitive to the light.  Antibiotic drops or ointment to promote healing and prevent infection.\t Sty (hordeolum) A painful red bump on the eyelid due to an infected oil or sweat gland. Warm compresses and antibiotic drops or ointment.\t Swollen eyelids (blepharitis) An inflammation in the oily glands of the eyelid. This usually results in swollen eyelids and crusting of the eyelashes.  Warm compresses and washing the eyelids with baby shampoo. Antibiotics may be needed if there's an infection.\t Note:  The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends eye exams for all children beginning in the newborn period and at all well-child visits.

        "content": "Droopy eyelid (ptosis) may appear as an enlarged or heavy upper lid; or, if it is very slight, it may be noticed only because the affected eye appears somewhat smaller than the other eye. Ptosis usually involves only one eyelid, but both may be affected. Your baby may be born with a ptosis, or it may develop later. The ptosis may be partial, causing your baby’s eyes to appear slightly asymmetrical; or it may be total, causing the affected lid to cover the eye completely. If the ptotic eyelid covers the entire pupillary opening of your child’s eye, or if the weight of the lid causes the cornea to assume an irregular shape (astigmatism), it will threaten normal vision development and must be corrected as early as possible. If vision is not threatened, surgical intervention, if necessary, is usually delayed until the child is four or five years of age or older, when the eyelid and surrounding tissue are more fully developed and a better cosmetic result can be obtained.\t Most birthmarks   and growths involving the eyelids of the newborn or young child are benign; however, because they may increase in size during the first year of life, they sometimes cause parents to become concerned. Most of these birthmarks and growths are not serious and will not affect your child’s vision. Many decrease in size after the first year of life and eventually disappear entirely without treatment. However, any irregularity should be brought to the attention of your child’s pediatrician so that it can be evaluated and monitored.\t Some children will develop lumps and bumps on their lids that can impair development of good eyesight. In particular, a blood vessel tumor called a capillary or strawberry hemangioma can start out as a small swelling, and rapidly enlarge. They will enlarge over the first year of life, and then start to spontaneously resolve over the next few years of life. If they become large enough, they can interfere with your baby’s development of good vision in the affected eye and will need to be treated. Because of their potential to cause vision problems, any child who starts to show any lumps or bumps around either eye should be examined by an  ophthalmologist .\t A child might also be born with a flat, purple colored lesion on their face called a port wine stain, because of its resemblance to a dark red wine. If this birthmark involves the eye, especially the upper lid, the child may be at risk for development of glaucoma (a condition where pressure increases inside the eyeball) or amblyopia (a weak eye muscle). Any child born with this birthmark needs to be examined by an ophthalmologist shortly after birth.\t Small dark moles, called nevi,   on the eyelids or on the white part of the eye itself rarely cause any problems or need to be removed. Once they have been evaluated by your pediatrician, these marks should cause concern only if they change in size, shape, or color.\t Small, firm, flesh-colored bulges on your child’s eyelids or underneath the eyebrows are usually dermoid cysts.   These are noncancerous tumors that usually are present from birth. Dermoids will not become cancerous if not removed; however, because they tend to increase in size during puberty, their removal during preschool years is preferred in most cases.\t Two other eyelid problems — chalazia   and hordeola   or sties — are common, but not serious. A chalazion is a cyst resulting from a blockage of an oil gland. A sty, or hordeolum, is a bacterial infection of the cells surrounding the sweat glands or hair follicles on the  edge  of the lid. Call your pediatrician regarding treatment of these conditions. He probably will tell you to apply warm compresses directly to the eyelid for twenty or thirty minutes three or four times a day until the chalazion or sty clears. The doctor may want to examine your child before prescribing additional treatment, such as an antibiotic ointment or drops. \t Once your child has had a sty or chalazion, she may be more likely to get them again. When chalazia occur repeatedly, it’s sometimes necessary to perform lid scrubs to reduce the bacterial colonization of the eyelids and open the oil gland pores.\t Impetigo   is a very contagious bacterial infection that may occur on the eyelid. Your pediatrician will advise you on how to remove the crust from the lid and then prescribe an eye ointment and oral antibiotics.",

        "content": "Children spend more time than ever staring at digital screens—on computers, tablets, TVs, smartphones and other devices. All that screen time can take a toll on children's wellbeing, including how their eyes may feel. Research  shows that children begin zooming in on digital media devices, such as their parents' tablets or smartphones, as young as 6 months old. By their teens, studies have found, kids spend nearly 7 hours a day using screened-based media, watching TV, playing video games and using social media. Especially if they're having fun, children might keep playing and watching to the point of eye-rubbing exhaustion. And this doesn't include additional time spent using screens at school and for homework. Why screen-time breaks are important Staring at a screen for long stretches without taking breaks can cause symptoms such as: Eye fatigue.  Muscles around the eye, like any others, can get tired from continued use. Concentrating on a screen for extended periods can cause concentration difficulties and headaches centered around the temple and eyes. Children may also use screen devices where lighting is less than ideal, causing fatigue from squinting. Blurry vision . Gazing at the same distance for an extended time can cause the eye's focusing system to spasm or temporarily \"lock up.\" This condition, called an    accommodation spasm , causes a child's vision to blur when he or she looks away from the screen. Some studies also suggest computer use and other close-up indoor activities may fuel rising rates of    myopia  (nearsightedness) among children, although this is not yet proven. More time  playing outside  may result in healthier vision development in children.  Dry eyes.\t Studies  show that people blink significantly less often when concentrating on a digital screen, which can leave eyes dry and irritated. Desktop and laptop computer use can be especially tough on children's eyes, because they're usually situated higher up in the visual field than a book, for example. As a result, the upper eyelids tend to be open wider—speeding up evaporation of the eye's tear film. What parents can do\t Monitor screen time.  The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) family    media use plan  and related reports target issues ranging from obesity to sleep problems linked with too much screen time. Two especially important aspects of this are making sure screens don't cut into:\t Sleep.  Not getting    enough shut-eye  leads to tired, sore eyes. The AAP recommends children not sleep with devices in their bedrooms, including TVs, computers and smartphones. In addition, the AAP recommends avoiding exposure to screens for 1 hour before going to bed. Using devices past bedtime, especially for    violent video games  or shows, can interfere with sleep. Studies also suggest the blue light given off by screens might also make it difficult to sleep. \t Exercise.  Putting down the device or stepping away from the computer or TV can help avoid eye and vision problems from too much screen time. The AAP    recommends  children age 6 years and older get at 60 minutes of physical activity each day.    Active play  is the best exercise for young children. Outside play can also be a great \"workout\" for children's vision—giving them a chance to focus at different distances and getting exposure to natural sunlight.\t Take frequent breaks.  Children frequently get so absorbed in what they're doing that they don't notice symptoms of eye strain. Remind them to take breaks. The American Optometric Association recommends the    20/20/20 rule : look away from the screen every 20 minutes, focus on an object at least 20 feet away, for at least 20 seconds.  In addition, children should walk away from the screen for at least 10 minutes every hour. A simple timer can help your child remember, and there are even software programs can help by turning off the screen in regular intervals.\t Remember to blink.\t Research  published in    The New England Journal of Medicine  says staring at a computer can cut blinking rates by half and cause dry eyes. Encourage your child to try to blink extra, especially when they take breaks. Your pediatrician or eye doctor may recommend moisturizing eye drops or a room humidifier if your child continues to be bothered by dry eyes.\t Screen positioning.  Make sure the screen on your child's desktop or laptop computer is slightly below eye level. Looking up at a screen opens eyes wider and dries them out quicker.  Some experts suggest positioning device screens based on the   1/2/10 rule: mobile phones ideally at one foot, desktop devices and laptops at two feet, and roughly 10 feet for TV screens (depending on how big the screen is). Adjusting the font size—especially on smaller screens—so it's twice as big as your child can comfortably read may also help reduce eye fatigue.\t Spotlight on lighting.  To cut down on glare and eye fatigue, consider the level of lighting in a room when using a computer or other screen. Ideally, it should be roughly half what it would be for other activities such as writing on paper or working on crafts.  Try to position computers so that light from uncovered windows, lamps and overhead light fixtures aren't shining directly on screens. Decrease the brightness of the screen to a more comfortable level for viewing. Some optometrists recommend special computer glasses with orange lenses that may also help reduce glare. Children who wear prescription eyeglasses may have an anti-reflective coating added, as well. Computer monitor hoods or shades that attach to the screen may also be an option.\t Get regular vision screenings.  If your child is having blurry vision or similar eye problems, he or she may not speak up. That's why regular    vision screenings  are important. The American Academy of Ophthalmology and the AAP recommend children have their eyes checked by a pediatrician at well-child visits beginning at birth. If a problem is found during one of these routine eye exams, your pediatrician may refer you to a    pediatric ophthalmologist . Does my child need blue-light filtering glasses?\t You may have heard about special glasses that help filter blue light given off from computers and other screens. Especially with more online learning during the pandemic, many wonder if these glasses should be on their child's back-to-school supply list. Although there is no evidence that blue-light is harmful to the eyes, it can make it harder for children to fall asleep and contribute to eye strain, However, turning screens off an hour before bed, using the 20/20/20 rule and the other tips above can help prevent this—no purchase necessary! Remember Children, especially younger ones, will likely need help and reminders to use digital screen devices in an eye-friendly way. If you have any questions about keeping your child's eyes and vision healthy, talk with your pediatrician.

        "content": "Glaucoma is a serious eye disorder caused by increased pressure within the eye. It may be due to either overproduction or inadequate drainage of the fluid within the eye. If this increased pressure persists too long, it can damage the optic nerve and cause loss of vision.  Although a child can be born with glaucoma (called congenital glaucoma), this is quite rare. More often it develops later. The earlier it is detected and treated, the better the chance of preventing permanent vision loss.  What are the signs of glaucoma in children? If your child experiences any of the following warning signs, call your pediatrician promptly: Excessive tearing that happens along with extreme sensitivity to light (your child will turn their head into the mattress or blankets to avoid light) Hazy or overly prominent appearance of either eye Increased irritability (typically because of persistent eye pain and discomfort)  How is childhood glaucoma treated?  Usually glaucoma must be treated surgically to create an alternate route for fluid to leave the eye. Any child who has this disease must be watched very carefully throughout their life so that the pressure is kept under control. The goal is to keep the optic nerve and cornea as healthy as possible.

It develops when a child has one eye that doesn't see well or is injured, and they begin to use the other eye almost exclusively. In general, amblyopia must be detected as early as possible in order to treat and restore normal vision in the affected eye. If the problem persists for too long (past 7 to 10 years of age), vision is often lost permanently in the unused eye. How is amblyopia treated? There are a couple ways amblyopia may be treated, including: E ye patching therapy Once an  ophthalmologist  diagnoses the problems in the weaker eye, your child may need to wear a patch over the \"good\" eye for periods of time. This forces them to use and strengthen the eye that has become \"lazy.\"  Patching therapy will be continued for as long as necessary to bring the weaker eye up to its full potential and keep it there. This could take weeks, months or even a few years.  Eye drops or ointment As an alternative to an eye patch, the ophthalmologist might prescribe eye drops or ointment to blur the vision in the good eye.

        "content": "By:  Sylvia H. Yoo, MD, FAAO, FAAP\t Myopia , or nearsightedness, is a common vision problem that often begins between the ages of 6 and 14. It affects an estimated 5% of preschoolers, about 9% of school aged children and 30% of adolescents. Children are more likely to develop myopia if their parents are nearsighted. However, myopia is on the rise overall, especially in kids. No one is exactly sure why, but experts believe it could be related to more time doing closeup tasks indoors like using    computers  and playing    video games .  Here's what you need to know about myopia and your child's vision. Eye development & vision What causes myopia? Myopia happens when your child's eyeball is too long from front to back. It can also develop when the    cornea , the clear window at the front of the eye, is curved too steeply. When light enters your child's eye, the rays fall just short of the    retina , the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. This makes distant objects blurry and close objects clear. In hyperopia, or farsightedness, distant objects are clearer than near objects. It takes more work to focus on everything, but especially on close-up objects. Children's eyes haven't totally developed yet, so some farsightedness is normal in childhood. Most kids don't experience blurry vision, though, because their eyes automatically focus. As they grow, children usually become less farsighted and may become nearsighted instead. Myopia generally gets worse through adolescence, then starts to stabilize in the early 20s. Myopia symptoms in children  Symptoms of myopia include: Complaints of blurry vision (like not being able to see the board in school) Squinting to try to see better Frequent eye rubbing Frequent headaches Diagnosing myopia If your child doesn't pass a    vision screening  at your pediatrician's office or at school, they may have myopia. To get a diagnosis, your child will need to see an    ophthalmologist  or an    optometrist .\t Ophthalmologists  have a degree in medicine (MD or DO). They do eye exams and prescribe glasses and contact lenses. They also diagnose and treat eye diseases and perform eye surgery. Optometrists have a degree in optometry (OD). They give eye exams, prescribe glasses and contact lenses, and screen for and treat certain vision problems. An    optician  is trained to make sure glasses that are prescribed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist fit correctly. Treatment of myopia in childhood Myopia cannot be reversed or cured, but it can be treated. The goals of treatment are to improve your child's vision and prevent it from getting worse. This is important for protecting their eye health in the future, even if they still need glasses or contact lenses. Glasses Glasses for myopia can be used all the time or just when they're needed so your child can see far away. It's important to choose frames that fit well and that work for your child's age and activities. For example, if you have a young child, it may help to buy glasses with a strap, so they stay on more easily. Or if your child plays sports, getting sports goggles will keep their regular glasses from getting broken. An optician can help you figure out what your child may need. Contact lenses Contact lenses are an option if your child prefers them. They can be helpful for certain activities too, especially sports. While there's no age limit for contacts, your child should be able to tolerate eye drops well and practice good hygiene. Contacts need to be cared for on a daily basis to prevent eye infections. It's important to always have glasses for backup, even if your child wears contact lenses most of the time. If your child has eye pain or redness while wearing contact lenses, contact your ophthalmologist or optometrist right away. Treatments to prevent myopia from getting worse Researchers are studying ways to prevent myopia from worsening in children. These potential treatments include: Low-dose atropine eye drops A low dose of the same type of eye drops that are used to dilate the pupils during an eye exam may help slow down myopia in children between 5 and 18 years old. Specialized contact lenses In some children, wearing a specialized    multifocal contact lens  that blurs their side vision may help slow their eye growth and limit myopia. Another type of contact lens treatment called orthokeratology, or Ortho-K, is worn overnight to flatten the    cornea . During the day, the reshaped cornea helps focus light properly on your child's retina to improve blurry vision. The safety of this treatment is a concern because wearing contact lenses while sleeping increases your child's risks of eye irritation and infection. It also increases the risk for more severe vision problems. More time outside Spending time outdoors can also help with myopia management. By balancing screen time with    outside time  when possible, you may help limit your child's nearsightedness and protect their vision as they grow. Remember If you think your child is experiencing symptoms of myopia, talk with your pediatrician. They can give your child a vision screening and help you figure out next steps, if necessary.

        "content": "By: Douglas R. Fredrick MD, FAAP Nystagmus is a condition where the eyes move constantly and uncontrollably, appearing to wiggle or shake side to side or up and down. Nystagmus can be seen in children who have other eye conditions that cause poor vision. However, it can also occur in children who have healthy eyes and only slightly decreased vision. When nystagmus develops suddenly later in life the condition may also affect balance and    coordination . People who develop nystagmus early in life typically are not aware of their eye movements, but other people may see them. Children who develop nystagmus in infancy do not see the world shaking back and forth, even though their eyes are in constant motion. Here's what else parents need to know about this condition.\t What are the signs of nystagmus in children? If your infant or child experiences any of the following symptoms, contact their pediatrician right away: Involuntary eye movements such as side-to-side (horizontal nystagmus), up-and-down (vertical nystagmus), or circular (rotary or torsional nystagmus) Uncontrollable movement in one eye or both eyes Seeing objects as    blurry  or shaky Issues seeing at night Sensitivity to light\t Dizziness  and problems with coordination or balance\t    My child has nystagmus. Here's what I'd like you to know.\t By: Domenica Pasinella \t My husband's grandmother was the first to point out that something was wrong with my infant son's eyes. They bounced to the left and right, and he turned his head to focus on us. We mentioned it to our pediatrician who referred us to a specialist. And at 16 weeks our son, Anthony, was diagnosed with nystagmus. During that appointment, we heard that Anthony would likely never walk correctly or drive. We left stunned. We lived like that for 14 months, until I found my community; my people. I'm a learner at heart, so I went out and found adults with nystagmus and parents of children with the condition. I found groups like the  American Nystagmus Network  and others on Facebook. I watched them treat each other with kindness and support. They celebrated each other's milestones, such as when someone got their driver's license. They shared information, like how to ask for school accommodations and what raised line paper is. Through this community, I also found doctors who specialize in nystagmus. I was able to keep up to date on the latest research. Most of all, my new network made me realize that it is possible for people with nystagmus to live full lives. And they helped me feel that we weren't alone. Today, Anthony loves tae kwon do; he's very into it. He plays basketball and rides a bike, with caution. He's a good reader and gets good marks in school.\t He is a little off balance, but he tries everything. One day, he came to us wanting to play baseball. We were very hesitant, but he really wanted to try. He struck out almost every time, and one time he took a baseball right to the mouth. He was so happy as he took the base, bloody mouth and all. I felt so guilty. Be there he was, nothing broken, celebrating on base. We talked to him right after the game. \"Buddy, if you can't see the ball, and want to be done, no problem, you never have to play baseball again.\" But he went to the next game. He was scared, but he went. Kids, they're so resilient. Thank goodness, he's now more interested in soccer. Anthony has a laundry list of other diagnoses, but I've followed the same playbook that I did with nystagmus. I seek out supportive communities to help navigate what's ahead. Nystagmus was a super scary diagnosis for me as a new parent. My message to parents encountering it for the first time is that it's not as scary as you think.\t Domenica Pasinella is secretary of the Board of Directors for the American Nystagmus Network. She's a mother of two and lives in Albany, N.Y. How is nystagmus diagnosed in infants and children? If your child is showing symptoms of nystagmus, the doctor will focus on your child's nervous system and inner ear. They may refer you to a pediatric ophthalmologist for testing, which may include: A    comprehensive eye exam  including dilation of the pupils, with special emphasis on how the eye moves and examination of the eye nerves and retina Patient history to determine if symptoms are from other health issues, medication, or other causes Testing how the eyes focus, move and work together A refraction to determine the lens power needed to compensate for    nearsightedness , farsightedness, or astigmatism\t MRI  or CT scan of the brain if there are other findings of neurologic disorder\t Ear exam Neurological exam Your child may also be asked to spin around for 30 seconds, stop, and try to stare at an object to observe the movement of their eyes. If your child has nystagmus due to a medical condition, the type and severity of the involuntary eye movements will depend on the cause. What are the causes and types of nystagmus in children? Nystagmus can be congenital, which means your child can be born with the condition. Children may also develop nystagmus later in life due to disease or    injury . Types of nystagmus\t Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS).  This type may also be known as infantile nystagmus, congenital nystagmus or early onset nystagmus. It most often develops between 6 weeks and several months of age. The uncontrollable movement of the eyes is typically in a horizontal swinging direction. INS is only diagnosed after other conditions, such as albinism,    cataracts , underdeveloped optic nerves and retinal disorders, have been ruled out in an exam. The cause of infantile nystagmus can be an inherited condition and is often not known.   \t   Spasmus nutans  usually occurs between 6 months and 3 years of age. Spasmus nutans typically improves on its own in children between 2 and 8 years of age. The involuntary eye movement may move in many directions. Children with spasmus nutans nystagmus may often tilt or nod their heads. They will need either an MRI or CT scan of the brain to make certain there are no associated neurologic disorders. However, this type of nystagmus typically does not require treatment or intervention.\t Acquired nystagmus.  This type of nystagmus develops later in childhood or adulthood. Uncontrollable eye movements can be side to side, up and down or circular. Acquired nystagmus can develop for many reasons. It may be caused by certain drugs or medicines, typically    antiseizure medicine  or other sedating medicine. It can also be the symptom of another condition or disease such as a    stroke , multiple sclerosis, inner ear disorders or trauma.   \t All children with newly acquired nystagmus should see their pediatrician, neurologist and a    pediatric ophthalmologist  to determine if there are any underlying causes.\t How is nystagmus treated in children? In many cases of congenital nystagmus, there is no treatment. Some types of nystagmus will improve throughout childhood. Many children with nystagmus will discover that their vision improves, and the amount of nystagmus decreases when they turn or tilt their head and look at objects with side gaze. These positions of gaze, called a \"null point,\" should not be discouraged by parents or teachers.   \t Most children born with nystagmus live normal, active lives. Getting help early on from orientation and mobility experts, physical and occupational therapy and low vision specialists will benefit both your child and your family. Some children may need    accommodations  to help with coordination, visual problems or nervous system disorders. Eyeglasses and    contact lenses  do not cure nystagmus, but they can sometimes improve vision changes that occur due to the condition. Large-print books, magnifying devices, raised line paper and increased lighting may also help your child. Operating on the muscles that move the eyes (strabismus surgery) is sometimes recommended for children with nystagmus. This changes the position of muscles that move the eyes. This surgery does not cure nystagmus, but it may reduce how much your child needs to turn their head for better vision (changes the null point described above). If your child is diagnosed with nystagmus, you can work with their doctor to create a treatment plan specific to the cause of your child's nystagmus.

        "content": "By: Daniel A. Greninger, MD, FAAO, FAAP\t A vision screening is a brief eye and vision check to help detect vision issues in children. It is an essential part of preventative eye care. Some eye problems in children first show up with squinting, blinking, red eye or other noticeable symptoms. However, other eye problems can have no symptoms and will only be detected during screening.  Some eye problems can cause permanent vision loss if left untreated in childhood. That's why it is important for your child's pediatrician to physically examine the eyes at each  well-check visit , and start formal vision screening tests once they're old enough.  What happens in a vision screening?  Vision screenings may be performed in different ways depending on your child's age. Some screenings need your child's cooperation to read or match images in an age-appropriate way. Other screenings use special tools to measure the eye position, reflection of light off the back of the eye or focus of light into the eye.  What happens if my child fails a vision screening?  If your child fails a vision screening they usually are referred to an eye doctor. This should be an ophthalmologist or optometrist who is experienced in the evaluation and treatment of children.  It is important to follow up with the eye doctor even if you are not noticing any vision problems. The eye doctor should perform a full eye examination. This includes dilating the pupils with eyedrops, and then telling you if your child needs eyeglasses or some other treatment.  When should my child's eyes get screened?  The American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that children have their eyes checked starting as newborns. After that, screenings are recommended during    well-child visits .  Vision screening schedule for infants and children Newborns :  At birth babies should have their eyes checked by their pediatrician for birth abnormalities, infections, cataracts and    glaucoma .    Premature babies  may need further specialized exams by an eye doctor when they're born.   Birth to 6 months:  This is a time to talk with your pediatrician about any   family history of childhood vision problems. The doctor will check the red reflex (light reflected through the pupil from the back of the eye), using a handheld device called an ophthalmoscope. They'll also have a look at the size and shape of the pupil and external parts of the eye.   6 months and up :   Your pediatrician will continue to check the red reflex, pupils, and external eye structures. In addition, they will check if each of your child's eyes will look at and appropriately follow a toy or face. They will also look for signs of    strabismus  (eye misalignment or \"wandering eye.\")   Starting at 1 to 2 years:   At this age, instrument-based screening devices may begin to be used for vision screening. These may include photoscreeners and autorefractors, computer-automated devices that use light and cameras to gauge how well your child can see. Starting at 3 years:   Visual acuity screening is recommended at ages 4 and 5 years, as well as in cooperative 3-year-olds. This involves asking your child how well they can see the details of letters or symbols from a set distance.\t More information\t Eye Problems in Children and How They're Treated\t Warning Signs of Vision Problems in Infants & Children \t Infant Vision Development: What Can Babies See?

Problems that are found early have a better chance of being treated successfully.  What are warning signs of a vision problem? Babies up to 1 year of age: Babies older than 3 months  should be able to follow or track an object, like a toy or ball, with their eyes as it moves across their field of vision. If your baby can't make steady eye contact by this time or seems unable to see, let your child's doctor know.  See  Infant Vision Development: What Can Babies See?  for more information. Before 4 months , most babies' eyes occasionally look misaligned (strabismus). However, after 4 months, inward crossing or outward drifting that occurs regularly is usually abnormal. If one of these is present, let your child's doctor know. Preschool age: If your child's eyes become misaligned, let your child's doctor know right away. However, vision problems such as a  lazy eye  (amblyopia) may have no warning signs, and your child may not report vision problems. That is why it's important at this time to have your child's vision checked. There are special tests to check your child's vision even if he cannot yet  read . All children:  If you notice any of the following signs or symptoms, let your child's doctor know: Eyes that are misaligned (look crossed, turn out, or don't focus together) White or grayish white color in the pupil Eyes that flutter quickly from side to side or up and down Eye pain, itchiness, or discomfort reported by your child.

        "content": "There are several ways to take your child’s temperature. What type of thermometer should you select? The American Academy of Pediatrics no longer recommends mercury thermometers because these glass thermometers may break and, as their mercury vaporizes, it can be inhaled, resulting in toxic levels. Digital electronic thermometers are better choices. \t \t  Digital devices  can   measure temperatures in your child’s mouth or rectum. As with any device, some digital thermometers are more accurate than others. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully, and be sure the thermometer is calibrated.\t   Ear thermometers  are   another acceptable choice. Their accuracy depends on the ability of the beam emitted by the device to reach the eardrum. Thus, some of these devices may not be as reliable because of earwax or a small curved ear canal. For that reason, most pediatricians prefer that parents use digital electronic thermometers.\t Use a digital thermometer (which shows the temperature in numbers in a small window), and avoid mercury thermometers. Whatever approach you use, clean the thermometer with lukewarm soapy water or rubbing alcohol before each use, and then rinse with cool water.\t \t  To take the temperature in your child’s bottom (rectally), turn on the digital thermometer and then put a small amount of lubricant, such as petroleum jelly, on the small end of it. Place your child across your lap or on something firm, either faceup or facedown (if he’s facedown, put one hand on his back; if he’s faceup, bend your child’s leg to his chest, resting your free hand on the back of his thighs). Then gently insert the small end of the thermometer in your child’s bottom (or rectum), putting it in about 1⁄2 inch to 1 inch. Hold the thermometer in place for about one minute, or until the device signals that it’s done (by beeping or lighting up). Remove it and read the number. Taking a rectal or oral temperature is more accurate than taking it under your child’s arm. Also, use one digital thermometer labeled “oral,” and another one labeled “rectal.” Don’t use the same thermometer in both places.\t   At ages four or five years old, you also can take your child’s temperature by placing the thermometer in his mouth (orally). After turning on the thermometer, place the small end under your child’s tongue, toward the back of his mouth. Ask him to close his mouth around the thermometer, and hold it in place. Remove it after about a minute, or until you hear the thermometer “beep” or see it light up. Then read the number. \t   Temporal artery thermometers are also available. While these are simple to use even while your child is asleep, they are relatively new so their reliability has not yet been verified.",

        "content": "By: Marissa Di Giovine, MD, FAAP & Eva Catenaccio, MD    Febrile seizures are a type of  seizure  that can affect otherwise healthy children around the time they have a  fever . Seizures can involve stiffening or shaking part of the body or the whole body.  When do febrile seizures occur? Febrile seizures happen in in 3 or 4 out of every 100 children. They can occur between 6 months and 5 years of age, but most often around 12 to 18 months old.  A febrile seizure usually occurs during the first few hours of a fever. While they are most common with fevers of 102°F (38.9°C) or above, they can also happen with milder fevers. What happens during a febrile seizure? Your child may look strange for a few moments, then stiffen, twitch and roll their eyes. They may be unresponsive for a short time, or have changes in their breathing or skin color. After the seizure, the child usually returns to normal quickly.  Seizures usually last less than one or two minutes but, although uncommon, can last longer. A seizure longer than 5 minutes is usually a medical emergency and requires urgent treatment to stop the seizure. Other kinds of seizures (ones that are not caused by fever) last longer, can affect only one part of the body, and may occur repeatedly.  If your child has a febrile seizure, act immediately to prevent injury. Place them on the floor or bed away from any hard or sharp objects. Turn their head to the side so that any saliva or vomit can drain from their mouth. Do not put anything into their mouth; they will not swallow her tongue. Call your child's doctor. If the seizure does not stop after 5 minutes,    call 911  or your local emergency number.    Are febrile seizures dangerous? While febrile seizures may be very scary, they usually are harmless to the child. Most febrile seizures are short and do not cause brain damage,    nervous system  problems, paralysis, intellectual disability or death. Long seizures need to be treated either with a rescue medication or by emergency medical services. Will my child have more seizures? Febrile seizures tend to run in families. The risk of having seizures with other episodes of fever depends on the age and development of your child. Children younger than 1 year of age at the time of their first seizure have about a 50% chance of having another febrile seizure. Otherwise healthy children older than 1 year of age at the time of their first seizure have only a 30% chance of having a second febrile seizure.  Most children out-grow febrile seizures by the time they get to school age. Only a very small number of children who have febrile seizures will go on to develop    epilepsy . Are there certain illnesses that cause febrile seizures? Febrile seizures can happen with any condition that causes a fever, such as common colds, the  flu , ear infection or    roseola . They can also happen if your child experiences  heat-related illness  such as heat stroke when there is a rise in core body temperature. Febrile seizures usually happen only once during any given illness, often with the first fever spike. However, they can occur just before or just after your child gets a fever.  Can febrile seizures happen after getting a vaccine? Vaccines can cause your child to have a fever, but febrile seizures are generally rare after vaccination. Recommended vaccines can actually help prevent some febrile seizures, since getting sick with measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, influenza (the flu), pneumococcal infections and other diseases can cause fevers and febrile seizures.  Febrile seizure treatments If your child has a febrile seizure, call your child's doctor right away. They will want to examine your child to identify the cause of their fever. It is more important to determine and treat the cause of the fever rather than the seizure. A spinal tap may be done to be sure your child does not have a serious infection like    meningitis , especially if they are younger than 1 year of age. In general, doctors do not recommend treatment of a simple febrile seizure with preventive medicines. However, this should be discussed with your child's doctor. In cases of prolonged or repeated seizures, the recommendation may be different. Medicines like    acetaminophen  and ibuprofen can help lower a fever, but they do not prevent febrile seizures. Your child's doctor will talk with you about the best ways to take care of your child's fever. Remember If your child has had a febrile seizure, do not fear the worst. These types of seizures are not dangerous to your child and do not cause long-term health problems. If you have concerns about this issue or anything related to your child's health, talk with your child's pediatrician.

        "content": "Let's face it, fevers can be scary for parents. When your child is burning up, it can be hard to think straight and make important decisions. Learning what causes fevers and how to treat them will ease your anxiety and help you take control of the situation. What causes a fever? Everyone has their own internal \"thermostat\" that regulates body temperature. Normal body temperature is around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit plus or minus about one degree (37 degrees Celsius, plus or minus about 0.6 degrees). When the body detects an infection or other illness, the brain responds by raising the body temperature to help fight the condition. A rectal temperature over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit is considered a fever. It is not always necessary for a child with a fever to see their doctor. It depends on the age of the child ( see \" Fever and Your Baby \" )  and the other symptoms they have. Managing your child's fever A fever can't always be detected by feeling your child's forehead. It's usually necessary to take their temperature as well. Although there are numerous thermometers on the market that measure temperature in different areas, parents should use rectal thermometers with their babies for the most accurate reading. ( See \" How to Take a Child's Temperature \"  for more information.) Once you've identified a fever, the most important things you can do is to make sure they get enough fluid, so they do not get    dehydrated . You can also help make them more comfortable. While you may instinctively want to bring your child to the doctor's office, it may not be necessary—especially if the child seems fine once their discomfort is treated. A \" tripledemic \" of respiratory viruses is making it harder to find over-the-counter children's pain and fever medications in some areas. Try not to panic if stores near you are out of stock. While fever-reducing medicines can make your child more comfortable, they do not cure illness. Keeping fever at bay Although  not every fever needs to be treated , there are some things you can do to help make your child more comfortable. A fever will cause a child to lose fluids more quickly, so offer plenty of    fluids to avoid dehydration . Signs of dehydration include crying without tears, a dry mouth, and fewer wet diapers.  Do not overdress your child. A single layer of clothing is good. If your child is shivering or has the chills, give them a blanket. Make them comfortable. Practices to reduce fevers such as an alcohol bath or ice packs and sponging, are no longer recommended. These can actually have adverse effects for your child. Giving a child    acetaminophen  or    ibuprofen  will usually reduce a fever. It is important to make sure you give    the right dose  to your child.  If your child is under two years of age, contact your pediatrician or pharmacist for the correct dose. For older children, follow the recommended dose on the label. Keep your digital  thermometer  ready and accessible so you don't have to search for it once your child is ill. Have children's acetaminophen or ibuprofen    on hand . Make sure your pediatrician's phone number is handy. When to call the doctor Call your child's doctor right away if your child has a fever and: Looks very ill, is unusually drowsy or is very fussy Has been in a very hot place, such as an    overheated car Has other symptoms, such as a stiff neck, severe headache, severe sore throat, severe ear pain, an unexplained rash or repeated vomiting or diarrhea Has signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth, sunken soft spot or significantly fewer wet diapers and unable to take in fluids Has immune system problems, such as  sickle cell disease  or  cancer , or is taking steroids Has had a    seizure Is younger than 3 months (12 weeks) and has a temperature of 100.4°F (38.0°C) or higher Fever rises above 104°F (40°C) repeatedly for a child of any age Also call your child's doctor if: Your child still \"acts sick\" once his fever is brought down. Your child seems to be getting worse. The fever lasts for more than 24 hours in a child younger than 2 years. The fever lasts for more than 3 days (72 hours) in a child 2 years of age or older.

        "content": "When your baby has a    fever , especially if it's their first one, it can be alarming. Keep in mind that fever, which is    sign or symptom  of illness, is usually a good sign that the body is fighting off an infection. But it's important to figure out the cause of your baby's fever so it can be treated, and to help keep your child    hydrated  and comfortable. What's considered a fever? A child's normal temperature can vary, depending on age and activity level. Time of day can also affect the reading. Body temperature is highest in the late afternoon and early evening, for example, and lowest at night and early morning. Plus, infants tend to have higher temperatures than older children. Generally, these are considered true fevers: Rectal reading of above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius)  Oral reading of above 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37.2 degrees Celsius) \t \t  How do I know if my baby has a fever? Whenever you think your child has a fever, take their temperature with a    thermometer . Feeling their forehead or other parts of the body is not accurate, especially if your baby is having chills. Using temperature sensitive tape or \"fever strips\" also is not reliable. Avoid using an ear thermometer for babies under 6 months old, since their ear canals are too small to allow an accurate reading.  Causes of fever in babies Fever in babies can develop with illnesses such as:\t Ear infections\t Common colds Urinary tract infections Throat or sinus infections Intestinal (bowel) infections RSV\t Croup\t Influenza (flu)\t Pneumonia The most serious conditions that can cause fever are infections blood ( sepsis ) and the brain and spinal cord ( meningitis ). Fever in newborns\t Infants younger than two months old  who have a fever need immediate medical attention, even if they appear well and show no other signs of being ill. The challenge is to find the cause of the fever quickly while avoiding putting the baby through unnecessary tests or hospitalizations.  About 10% of young infants with fever are found to have urinary tract infections. The rate is even higher in uncircumcised boys. That's why having a urine sample checked is important. However, young infants can have more serious underlying infections that can rapidly progress. If your newborn develops a fever, contact your health care provider, without delay, and discuss steps needed to evaluate and treat your baby. Febrile convulsions In children between 6 months old and five years of age, fever can trigger seizures. These are called    febrile convulsions . A child may get an odd look on their face for a few moments, then stiffen or twitch, roll their eyes, and become unresponsive for a short time. Febrile convulsions typically last less than a minute—or even just a few seconds--though it can seem forever to a frightened parent. Thankfully, febrile convulsions are not common and almost always are harmless, causing no lasting damage to the brain or nervous system. However, if your baby has a febrile convulsion, be sure to tell your pediatrician promptly.  Raised body temperature from heatstroke Fever should not be confused with    heat-related illness , or    heatstroke .  This is not caused by infection. Instead, this dangerous condition is caused by surrounding    heat  in their environment and dehydration. With heatstroke, body temperature can rise to dangerous levels (above 105 degrees Fahrenheit [40.5 degrees Celsius]). Dozens of children die each year when left unattended in closed,    overheated car s, for example. Never leave your baby alone in closed car, even for a few minutes. Babies can also develop heatstroke if    overdressed  in hot, humid weather.  If you think your child has heatstroke,    c all 911  or go to the emergency department right away.  Does teething cause fever? Teething, which often starts at about 6 months of age, can cause a slight rise in your baby's body temperature within the normal range. However, research shows teething does not cause a true fever.

        "content": "If you're worried your child may be sick, it's a good idea to check them for fever before they go to    school ,    child care  or    sports activities . Feeling your child's forehead is quick but not very exact. Most modern digital thermometers work fast and are easy to use. What type of thermometer is best for my child? It is best to use a digital thermometer to check your child's temperature. Do NOT use a mercury thermometer. These thin glass devices filled with the silvery metal can break and release    toxic  levels of mercury fumes. In fact, if you have a mercury thermometer at home, you should    remove  it.\t \t \t What is a normal temperature, and what is considered a fever? A \"normal\" temperature varies with the child's age, activity, and time of day. A    fever  usually is a temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) or higher. This is a sign that the body is fighting an illness. Your child's temperature, age and other signs of illness will help your doctor recommend treatment that is best for your child. Call your pediatrician right away if your child:\t   is    2 months old  or younger with a rectal temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, or if fever rises above 104°F (40°C) repeatedly at any age.  looks very ill, is unusually drowsy, or is very fussy. has been in a    very hot place , such as an overheated car. has other symptoms, such as a stiff neck, severe    headache , severe    sore throat , severe ear pain, an unexplained rash, or repeated vomiting or diarrhea. has immune system problems, such as    sickle cell disease  or    cancer , or is taking steroids. has had a    seizure .   What are some different types of digital thermometers? There are different types of digital thermometers that measure temperature at different areas of the body. Rectal (in the anus) temperatures are the most accurate. Forehead temperatures are the next most accurate. Oral and ear temperatures are accurate if done properly. Armpit temperatures are the least accurate, but you can use this method to screen a child of any age.  Whichever approach you use to take your child's temperature, follow the cleaning instructions on the thermometer's package before use.  Here are 3 types of digital thermometers: Digital multi-use thermometer\t Measures temperature in child’s bottom (rectal), mouth (oral) or armpit (axillary).  Oral use is not recommended until a child is age 4 or older. Reads body temperature when the sensor located on the tip of the thermometer touches that part of the body. It's important to label the thermometer \"oral\" or \"rectal\" so it isn't used in both places. Temporal artery\t   Measures infrared heat waves coming off the blood vessel that runs across the forehead just below the skin.  Can be used for all ages. Temperature is taken on the side and front of the forehead, depending on whether it is a    non-contact  or \"no-touch\" model. Check the instructions to find out how close to the forehead and other tips before using. Non-contact models may help reduce the risk of passing germs. Direct sunlight and cold temperatures after being outside may affect reading. Tympanic\t   Measures temperature in a child's ear by reading infrared heat waves from the eardrum. Can be used on children age 6 months and older. Not reliable for younger babies, whose ear canals are too narrow. It needs to be placed correctly in your child's ear canal to be accurate (see \"Ear temperature,\" below). Cold temperatures after being outside can affect reading. How to use a digital thermometer To get the right thermometer reading, it is important    to always follow the instructions that came with the device .  Rectal temperature Taking a    rectal temperature  gives the best reading, especially for infants under 3 months of age. Here is how to take a rectal temperature: Put a small amount of lubricant, such as petroleum jelly, on the end of the thermometer and on your child's bottom. Place your child belly down across your lap or on a firm surface. Another way is on the back with the legs pulled up to the chest. Turn the thermometer on and slide it 1/2 inch (for babies less than 6 months old) to 1 inch into the anus. Be gentle. There should not be any resistance. If there is, stop. Hold your child still. Leave the thermometer in place until it beeps. Then remove and check the digital reading.\t    Thermometers should be disinfected before and after use with disinfecting soap and water or disinfecting alcohol swab.\t    Label the rectal thermometer so it is not accidentally used in the mouth. Oral temperature Once your child is 4 years old, you can take a temperature by mouth. Here is how to take an    oral temperature :\t If your child has had a hot or cold drink, wait 30 minutes. Turn the thermometer on and place the tip under one side of your child’s tongue toward the back of the mouth. Have your child hold the thermometer with their lips and fingers. Do not use the teeth to keep in place.  Keep the lips sealed over the thermometer until it beeps. Check the digital reading.  Forehead temperature Temporal artery (forehead) thermometers can be used on children of any age. Here is how to take a    forehead temperature : Follow the instructions on the package to know how and where to slide or aim the sensor across the forehead to get the most accurate measurement.  The sensor measures the heat waves coming off the temporal artery. This blood vessel runs across the forehead just below the skin. Read your child's temperature on the display screen. Ear temperature Tympanic (ear) thermometers can be used on children 6 months of age and older, as young infants have narrow ear canals. Here is how to take an    ear temperature : Follow the instructions on the package.  A correct temperature depends on pulling the ear back. Pull the ear back and up if the child is over 1 year old. Then aim the tip of the ear probe between the opposite eye and ear.  Being outdoors on a  cold  day may cause a low reading. Wait 15 minutes after coming indoors to take the temperature.  Some quick screening ways may not be best\t Some products and quick methods are not as accurate at checking a child's temperature. For example, taking the temperature under the armpit can help schools and child care centers quickly check, but is not very accurate. \t Other less accurate ways of checking for fever include using a pacifier thermometer (for children  1 year of age  and younger) and fever strips on the forehead. While parents can use them for quick screening, they    do not work as well  as measuring your child's rectal, forehead, ear or oral temperature with a digital thermometer.\t   Remember Fever is just one sign of illness, but an important one. Talk with your child's pediatrician if you have any questions about fever and taking your child's temperature. More Information\t Fever\t Ask the Pediatrician: Are infrared thermometers safe?

While it is important to look for the cause of a fever, the main purpose for      treating  it is to help your child feel better if they are uncomfortable or have pain. What is a fever? Normal body temperature varies with age, general health, activity level and time of day.      Infants  tend to have higher temperatures than      older children . Everyone's temperature is highest between late afternoon and early evening, and lowest between midnight and early morning. Even how much clothing a person wears can affect body temperature.\t   A fever is a body temperature that is higher than normal. While the average normal body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), a normal temperature range is between 97.5°F (36.4°C) and 99.5°F (37.5°C). Most pediatricians consider a temperature above 100.4°F (38°C) as a sign of a fever.      What are the signs and symptoms of fever in children? If your child has a fever, they may feel warm, appear flushed or sweat more than usual. They may also be more thirsty than usual. Some children feel fine when they have a fever. However, most will have symptoms of the illness that is causing the fever. Your child may have an      earache , a      sore throat , a      rash  or a      stomach ache .

        "content": "If your infant or child is older than 6 months and has a    fever , they probably do not need to be treated for the fever unless they are uncomfortable. The key is to watch your child's behavior. If they are drinking, eating, sleeping normally, and is able to play, you do not need to treat the fever. Instead, you should wait to see if the fever improves by itself. What you can do to help your child feel better Keep their room comfortably cool. Make sure that they are dressed in light clothing. Encourage them to drink fluids such as water or a store-bought    electrolyte solution . Be sure that they do not overexert themselves. What    not  to do if your child has a fever Do    not  use aspirin to treat your child's fever or discomfort. Aspirin has been linked with side effects such as an upset stomach, intestinal bleeding, and Reye syndrome.    Reye syndrome  is a serious illness that affects the liver and brain. Do not use sponging to reduce your child's fever. Cool or cold water can cause shivering and increase your child's temperature. Never apply rubbing alcohol on your child to treat fever. Rubbing alcohol can be absorbed into the skin or inhaled, causing serious conditions such as a coma.\t \t \t Fever & pain medicine for children\t Acetaminophen  and    ibuprofen  can help your child feel better if your child has a headache or body aches or a fever that is making them uncomfortable. \t Acetaminophen  for children comes in liquid as well as pills that can be chewed. It also comes as a pill that is put in the rectum (suppository) if your child is vomiting and can't keep down medicine taken by mouth.\t Ibuprofen  comes in liquid for infants and children and chewable tablets that may be given to older children. With ibuprofen, keep in mind that there are 2 different kinds of liquid medicines: one for infants and one for children (including toddlers and children up to age 11 years). Infant drops are stronger (more concentrated) than the medicine for children. A \" tripledemic \" of respiratory viruses is making it harder to find over-the-counter children's pain and fever medications in some areas. Try not to panic if stores near you are out of stock. While fever-reducing medicines can make your child more comfortable, they do not cure illness.  Remember Always look carefully at the label on the medicine and follow the directions. Each type of medicine has different directions based on the age and weight of a child. You should ask your child's doctor about the right dose for your child. Also, if your child is taking other medicines check the ingredients. If they include acetaminophen or ibuprofen, let your child's doctor know.

        "content": "By: Robert W. Frenck Jr., MD, FAAP Birds in the United States can be affected by avian flu (also called H5N1 bird flu or avian influenza). But can it affect your family? Here's what parents need to know about bird flu. What causes bird flu? Bird flu is caused by    avian influenza type A viruses , including the avian flu type A(H5N1) that is the most recent strain circulating in our country. The virus is known to infect birds around the world. Is bird flu spreading in the United States? Sometimes, wild birds spread the virus and cause outbreaks on poultry farms. In January 2022, it was found in wild birds in our country for the first time since 2016. Several states have since reported bird flu in poultry flocks and wild birds. In the past few years, tens of millions of chickens were    removed  from farms where the virus was detected. This affected the egg supply and caused a big increase in the price of eggs. Does bird flu only make birds sick? Bird flu is common in wild birds—especially wild waterfowl like ducks and geese. It is spread easily by infected birds that carry the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions and droppings (feces). When sick birds fly overhead, the virus can spread through their droppings to farms and backyard pens. If your family keeps birds as backyard pets or on small hobby farms, they are also at risk. Other animals can get bird flu, too. Wildlife and domestic livestock that are exposed to the viruses can become infected. In March 2024, bird flu was identified in dairy cattle in    several states . It is the first time that this virus has been found in cows. Several    cats on a farm in Texas  also died after drinking    raw milk from infected cows . Public health experts are watching the outbreaks and infections very closely. Can people get bird flu? In very rare cases, bird flu can    spread  to humans. A concern about bird flu is that a strain could change and infect people and spread easily among them. That has not happened yet, but there have been a handful of cases of bird flu in people reported in the United States since 2022. As of July 3, 2024, four people have been identified with \" highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) \" virus bird flu. All four people worked with dairy cows that were presumably infected with bird flu. This is the first time that the virus has spread   from cows to people in the United States. Two people were infected on separate dairy farms in Michigan, one person was infected on a dairy farm in Colorado, and one was infected on a dairy farm in Texas. In 2022, one person was infected while working closely with birds. They had very mild symptoms and recovered. Health experts continue to    watch  for any changes in how the virus spreads—including in people with exposure to dairy cows and poultry. What are the symptoms of bird flu in people? In people,    signs and symptoms  of bird flu can include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, pneumonia, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, acute respiratory distress, respiratory failure, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting and sometimes neurologic changes (altered mental status, seizures). Will the flu vaccine protect me from bird flu? Seasonal flu vaccination will not prevent infection with bird flu viruses. The    annual influenza vaccine  protects against three strains that are most widely circulating in humans. The risk of kids—or adults—getting seasonal influenza is much greater. That is why annual influenza vaccination is recommended for everyone age 6 months and older. Can bird flu spread through chicken or dairy products? You cannot get bird flu from eating    fully cooked  domestic or wild poultry products like chicken, turkey or duck. There is no evidence that the flu can be spread through pasteurized dairy products. Is    raw milk  safe to drink? \"Raw,\" unpasteurized milk can harbor dangerous microorganisms, such as   \t Salmonella , \t   Escherichia coli  and   \t  Listeria ,  that can pose serious health risks. Pasteurization is a process that kills harmful bacteria by heating milk to a specific temperature for a set period. Health officials have long    advised against  drinking raw milk, which has not been pasteurized. However, raw milk may be extra risky now because of possible transmission of H5N1 virus. Public health experts keep a close watch for bird flu outbreaks on farms to make sure our food supply is safe. People who work in the livestock industry also follow safety steps to protect themselves and others in case they have close contact with sick animals. Are eggs safe to eat? Cooking eggs will kill any virus or bacteria, so they are    safe to eat . The germs that can make us sick are found on the eggshell.\t Salmonella ,  \t   Campylobacter  and other germs get on the egg shell from bird poop. Poultry often carry these germs. (That's why health experts advise us to avoid eating raw eggs and avoid licking the bowl when we make cake or cookie batter!) What about eggs from backyard chickens? Eggs from the grocery store are washed before they are put into their cartons. If your family has backyard poultry, be sure to    clean eggs  carefully with fine sandpaper, a brush, or a cloth to remove germs from their shells. Don't wash warm, fresh eggs because colder water can pull germs into the egg through tiny pores in the shell. Other healthy steps include keeping a clean coop, collecting eggs often and throwing away cracked eggs you collect. Remember In general, birds carry a lot of diseases besides bird flu. The best way to avoid getting sick is to make sure that children    wash their hands  with soap and water after being around any bird or bird droppings. Supervise children around birds and remind them not to rub their eyes or touch their nose or mouth while handling birds or bird feces. Tell your child not to touch, handle or move a sick or dead bird. They should let an adult know, so that it can be reported.

        "content": "Unfortunately, there's no cure for the common cold.\t Antibiotics  may be used to fight bacterial infections. But they have no effect on viruses, like those that cause a    cold  or    the flu .  The best you can do is to make your child comfortable. Make sure your child gets extra rest and drinks plenty of water or other liquids. Your pediatrician may want to see your child or ask you to watch them closely. Be sure to report back if their    symptoms  do not get better each day or are not all better after one week.\t \t \t How to clear a stuffy nose & congestion Nasal spray Use salt water (saline) nose drops. You can buy these or make your own. Give 1 to 2 drops in each opening of the nose (nostril) or spray 1 to 2 sprays in each nostril. For infants, use a rubber suction bulb to suck out the extra drops or spray.\t Tip:  When using the nasal suction bulb, remember that before you put the bulb on your baby's nose, first squeeze the bulb part of the syringe. Then, gently stick the rubber tip into one nostril, and then slowly let go of the bulb. This slight amount of suction will pull the clogged mucus out of the nose and should help your baby breathe and suck at the same time once again. You'll find that this works best when your baby is under 6 months of age.   \t As your baby gets older, they will fight the bulb, making it difficult to suck out the mucus, but the saline drops will still help. Humidifiers & vaporizers Consider putting a humidifier or vaporizer in your child's room. This helps moisten the air and may help clear your child’s nasal passages. Put it near your child but safely    out of their reach .\t Tip:  Be sure to clean the humidifier or vaporizer often, as recommended by the manufacturer. This helps prevent growth of mold and bacteria or buildup of minerals. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency offers more information on the use and care of home humidifiers    here .   How to help your child's cough Honey There's some    evidence  that honey may help ease coughs in children. However,    do not give honey to babies under 12 months old.  It is not safe because honey can contain bacteria that causes    infant botulism .  If you want to give honey to a child over 1 year of age, you can try: For children ages 1 to 5 years old: half a teaspoon of honey For children ages 6 to 11 years old: 1 teaspoon of honey For children 12 years or older: 2 teaspoons of honey\t Tip:  If honey is given at bedtime, make sure your child's teeth are brushed afterward to avoid    tooth decay .\t Consider cough drops or lozenges for children 4 and older.  Do not give cough drops or lozenges to a child younger than 4 years because he could choke on them. Also, do not give your child more cough drops than what the instructions on the package say. Mentholated ointment or vapor rubs \t For children ages 2 years and older :   Rub a thick layer of mentholated rub on top of the skin on the chest and the front of the neck (throat area). The body's warmth helps the medication go into the air slowly over time. The child breathes in this air, which helps to soothe a cough, so they can sleep. If you use a mentholated ointment, keep in mind: After using the medicine, put its container away and out of reach of children. Only use mentholated rubs on top of the skin. As with any medication, read and follow the directions closely. How to bring down your child's fever Acetaminophen or ibuprofen  If your child has a fever and is very uncomfortable, give them a medication with just one ingredient―either    acetaminophen  or    ibuprofen . Always call your pediatrician before giving medicine to a child under 2 years of age and call right away if your child is under three months of age and has a fever. For children over the age of 2 years, check the label to see how much medicine to give. If you know your child's weight, use that. If you do not know your child's weight, go by age for the dose amount.    See \t   Fever and Pain Medicine: How Much to Give Your Child  for more information.  Ibuprofen can be used in children 6 months of age and older; however, it should never be given to children who are having a lot of trouble drinking enough liquids (children who are    dehydrated ) or who are throwing up a lot. Ask your child's doctor for the right medicine and dose in milliliters (mL) for your child's age and size. Always measure each dose using a tool (syringe, dosing cup, or measuring spoon) that is marked in milliliters.    See  \" How to Use Liquid Medicine for Your Child \"  for more information.\t Do not give your child aspirin , which has been linked with    Reye syndrome , a rare but very serious illness that affects the liver and the brain. What to know about over-the-counter cough & cold medicines for children\t   Over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicines  should \t NOT  be given to infants and children under 4 years of age   because of the risk of dangerous side effects. \t Several studies show that cold and cough products that are taken by mouth don't work  in children younger than 6 years old. A Food & Drug Administration (FDA) panel recently    advised  that phenylephrine, commonly used in OTC nasal decongestant medicines, works no better to relieve symptoms that a placebo (fake medicine).\t Many cold medicines already have acetaminophen (Tylenol or generic) in them.  If you give one of these medicines along with acetaminophen or (Tylenol or generic), your child will get a    double dose . If your child is prescribed antibiotics for a secondary bacterial infection Antibiotics don't work against viral illnesses and can be    harmful  if taken when not needed. However, colds can sometimes lead to secondary infections. These include sinus, ear or lung infections that may be caused by bacteria. Watch for symtoms of secondary infections such as earache or ear discharge; sinus pain; trouble breathing or rapid breathing; fever that lasts more than 3 days or that goes away for 24 hours and then comes back. If your child develops these symptoms, let you pediatrician know. If your child is diagnosed with a secondary bacterial infection and is prescribed antibiotics, it is important to:\t Make sure your child takes them exactly as the instructions say , even if they feel better. If antibiotic treatment stops too soon, the infection may get worse or spread in the body. Call the doctor if your child is not getting better with treatment.\t If the antibiotic is a \t   liquid , ask your child's doctor for the right dosage  in milliliters (mL) for your child's age and size. Always measure each dose using a tool (syringe, cup, or spoon) that is marked in milliliters.

        "content": "Why get vaccinated?\t Influenza vaccine  can prevent influenza (flu).\t Flu   is a contagious disease that spreads around the United States every year, usually between October and May. Anyone can get the flu, but it is more dangerous for some people. Infants and young children, people 65 years of age and older, pregnant women, and people with certain health conditions or a weakened immune system are at greatest risk of flu complications. Pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections and ear infections are examples of flu-related complications. If you have a medical condition, such as heart disease, cancer or diabetes, flu can make it worse. Flu can cause fever and chills, sore throat, muscle aches, fatigue, cough, headache, and runny or stuffy nose. Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults. Each year    thousands of people in the United States die from flu , and many more are hospitalized. Flu vaccine prevents millions of illnesses and flu-related visits to the doctor each year.   Live, attenuated influenza vaccine CDC recommends everyone 6 months of age and older get vaccinated every flu season.  Children 6 months through 8 years of age  may need 2 doses during a single flu season.    Everyone else  needs only 1 dose each flu season. Live, attenuated influenza vaccine (called LAIV) is a nasal spray vaccine that may be given to non-pregnant people    2 through 49 years of age . It takes about 2 weeks for protection to develop after vaccination. There are many flu viruses, and they are always changing. Each year a new flu vaccine is made to protect against three or four viruses that are likely to cause disease in the upcoming flu season. Even when the vaccine doesn't exactly match these viruses, it may still provide some protection. Influenza vaccine    does not cause flu . Influenza vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines.   Talk with your health care provider Tell your vaccine provider if the person getting the vaccine: Is    younger than 2 years or older than 49  years of age. Is    pregnant . Has had    an allergic reaction after a previous dose of influenza vaccine , or    has any severe, life-threatening allergies . Is a  child or adolescent 2 through 17 years of age who is receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing products . Has a    weakened immune system . Is a    child 2 through 4 years old who has asthma or a history of wheezing  in the past 12 months. Has    taken influenza antiviral medication  in the previous 48 hours.\t Cares for severely immunocompromised persons  who require a protected environment. Is    5 years or older and has asthma . Has   other underlying medical conditions that can put people at higher risk of serious flu complications (such as    lung disease, heart disease, kidney disease, kidney or liver disorders, neurologic or neuromuscular or metabolic disorders ). Does  not have a spleen , or has a  non-functioning spleen. Has a  cerebrospinal fluid leak  (a leak of the fluid that surrounds the brain to the nose, throat, ear or some other location in the head). Has a  cochlear implant . Has had  Guillain-Barré Syndrome  within 6 weeks after a previous dose of influenza vaccine. In some cases, your health care provider may decide to postpone influenza vaccination to a future visit. For some patients, a different type of influenza vaccine (inactivated or recombinant influenza vaccine) might be more appropriate than live, attenuated influenza vaccine. People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting influenza vaccine. Your health care provider can give you more information.   Risks of a vaccine reaction Runny nose or nasal congestion, wheezing and headache can happen after LAIV. Vomiting, muscle aches, fever, sore throat and cough are other possible side effects. If these problems occur, they usually begin soon after vaccination and are mild and short-lived. As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death. What if there is a serious problem? An allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated person leaves the clinic. If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness), call    9-1-1  and get the person to the nearest hospital. For other signs that concern you, call your health care provider. Adverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your health care provider will usually file this report, or you can do it yourself. Visit the    VAERS  website or call    1-800-822-7967 .    VAERS is only for reporting reactions, and VAERS staff do not give medical advice.   The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines. Visit the    VICP  website or call    1-800-338-2382  to learn about the program and about filing a claim. There is a time limit to file a claim for compensation. How can I learn more?

        "content": "​ ​By: Kristina A. Bryant, MD, FAAP Influenza (the flu) can be deadly for older adults. But did you know that  the flu  can be very serious for babies and young children?  Last flu season was off to an early start. In October 2022, flu hospitalization rates were  the highest in 10 years  for children under age 4 years and older adults.  The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encourages as many children as possible to get a  flu vaccine every year . Babies and children can get other recommended immunizations when they get their flu shot.  Fortunately, parents and caregivers have immune-boosting tools to keep babies healthy. Influenza may be spreading in many areas, but it is not too late to get a flu shot. We do not know how long or severe this influenza season will be. Read on for ways to  prevent flu  from spreading to infants and young children. Are babies and young children at higher risk from the flu? Yes.  Because of their age , even healthy babies and young children are at higher risk of getting very sick from the flu. Here's what we know: Kids younger than age 2 years are at highest risk. Infants younger than age 6 months have the highest rates of hospitalization and death. They are too young to be vaccinated.  Healthy children age 2 years to 5 years are more likely to be taken to a doctor, an urgent care center or the emergency room because of flu, compared to older healthy kids.  Parents also should keep in mind:  Your baby's immune system is still developing. This can put them at higher risk of infection from viruses like flu or make it harder to respond to infections. Your young child may not have been exposed to influenza viruses. Because the past two flu seasons were mild, some young children might not have immunity to influenza. Does my baby need two doses of the flu shot? Maybe.  Two doses  are needed if your child is age 6 months to 8 years and:  it is the first time they are being vaccinated against influenza or  they have only received one dose of flu vaccine ever before July 1, 2023.  The doses are given four weeks apart. After the first dose, the immune system gets ready to respond to influenza. Young children may not have a high level of immune protection yet. After the second dose, they have a higher level of immune protection. Just one dose is needed each year after that. Two weeks after they receive all recommended doses of flu vaccine, their immune system will be fully ready to respond. The next time your child is exposed to influenza, they will be better prepared to avoid getting very sick. Babies can get the flu shot at any point in the flu season. Sooner is better, especially the first time they get the vaccine or if they only had one dose ever. Do breastfed babies need a flu shot?  Yes. Flu vaccines are recommended for  pregnant  and breastfeeding people and their babies age 6 months and older.  Getting a flu shot while pregnant or breastfeeding helps your baby boost their immune system. Antibodies against flu are passed to your baby in the womb or through breastmilk. Once babies are 6 months or older, being vaccinated enhances their immunity.  Household members benefit from immune-boosting protection of the influenza vaccine, too. They will be less likely to expose babies to the flu. It's like having a cocoon around the baby to protect them if they are too young to be vaccinated.  When should I call the pediatrician about my baby's flu symptoms? If your baby or young child has  emergency warning signs of flu , seek medical care for them right away.  Young children or those with underlying medical conditions are at a higher risk of complications from the flu. Your pediatrician can help determine if they need  flu antiviral drugs . Flu antiviral drugs work best when they are started within 48 hours of the start of symptoms. However, they can be started later in children who are severely ill or at high risk. Parents and their pediatrician should discuss the risks and benefits of antiviral medication.  Any child who has worsening flu symptoms should be examined by a health care provider. Keep in mind that: Children who develop breathing difficulties  may need to be treated with oxygen or require other respiratory support.  Vomiting and diarrhea can cause dehydration.  When this happens, they may need extra fluids given through an intravenous catheter.  Antibiotics  do not treat the flu.  However, your child may need them if they develop an ear infection, bacterial pneumonia or other problem.  Antiviral drugs prescribed to treat COVID-19 do not work to treat flu.  Only flu antiviral drugs work to treat flu.  What should parents of young children do if they get sick with influenza? Parents or caregivers who develop flu  symptoms  should call their health care provider to determine whether they need  antiviral medicine .  Ideally, sick caregivers should arrange for another healthy adult in the home to care for their baby or young child. If no other caregiver is available, wear a face mask when holding, feeding or providing care to help prevent the spread of virus.  Remember The flu virus is common. It is also not predictable. Most people who get the flu are sick for at least a week. Some people get much sicker, and even healthy young children may get very sick.  For children who are at least 6 months of age, influenza vaccine is the best way to avoid serious illness. And to protect children younger than 6 months, influenza vaccination is recommended for all eligible family members every year.

        "content": "By: Andrew N. Hashikawa, MD, MS, FAAP \t We have learned a lot recently about how to help kids in child care avoid getting sick when respiratory illnesses are spreading.  Still, infants in child care under age 6 months are too young to get flu (influenza) or COVID vaccines. Children younger than 2 years are too young to wear a mask. Masks are recommended in areas with medium and high community levels of COVID and any time spread is more likely.  What can be done to keep children healthy?  Get a flu shot For kids in child care settings, staying up to date on vaccines like flu vaccinations is key. Flu shots will not prevent COVID, the cold, or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). But like these illnesses, the flu can make babies and young children very sick.  Nearly every flu season, very young children are hit the hardest by the flu. In 2019-2020 (before the pandemic), a record-breaking 199 children died from the    flu . Most who died that year had not received flu vaccinations. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), by Dec. 31, the flu already led to 74 deaths among children this season.    Flu vaccines protect babies and young kids. That way, it is   much less likely they will need hospital care or die from flu complications. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends   flu vaccines for babies and children 6 months of age and older. Your child can catch up on all immunizations at a well-child    visit . And remember, parents and child care staff need annual flu shots, too. Child care staff may have received their COVID vaccines. But COVID shots do not protect us from the flu.  It's not too late! Many children still need to get a flu shot this season. The timing of flu season can change each year. Flu season usually starts in October, peaks in February and may last into May.  Children are also still getting infected with COVID. Children eligible for a flu shot and COVID shot can get both at the same visit. The AAP recommends COVID vaccines for everyone age 6 months and older. Adults and kids who are eligible should get an updated COVID vaccine, too, when it is time. (Read about COVID vaccines for kids    here .) Flu shots protect the people around us.  What happens at daycare when everyone is up to date on vaccinations? Kids can stay in school and other activities.  Adults will not have to miss work or obligations.  We protect children who are too young to get vaccinated. Community immunity through influenza vaccination helps keep those around us safe—people at high risk of serious illness, like cancer patients and our grandparents. Older people ( 65 years and older ) need flu shots, too. They are at higher risk of getting very sick from the flu. \t Being up to date on vaccines protects infants in child care who are too young to get vaccinated. Serious flu illness and death can be (mostly) avoided.  We all know that little kids like to put everything in their mouths! Young children's immune systems are not fully developed. Flu shots equip protect young kids' immune systems to resist influenza virus in child care.  So why do some children with the flu end up in the hospital? The flu can make their body very weak and dehydrated—much more than a common cold. Children may need hospital care if their body becomes too weak from the flu. Sometimes, children develop complications from being sick, like pneumonia (when the infection spreads to the lungs).  There is no cure for the flu. Antiviral medicine can shorten the time that a person is sick. But they do not replace the need to get a flu shot. Remember As we have learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, there is not one way to prevent    illnesses at child care . But layers of protection will keep us safe. This includes:  teaching young children how to wash their hands and use hand sanitizer when developmentally ready, making sure that eligible children and staff are vaccinated  keeping everyone informed about child care sick-child policies so they know when a   sick child should stay home contacting your pediatrician if you have any questions about getting the flu shot.  When we all do our part, it keeps us healthy. It keeps our friends healthy—and it protects those at highest risk, too.

        "content": "By: Robert W. Frenck Jr, MD, FAAP\t     What do COVID-19, Lyme disease and influenza have in common? All are zoonotic infections typically found in animals—but they can spread to humans.  Pigs and    birds​  are the two main animal hosts for influenza. Influenza virus infects the animal and reproduces in its cells. Swine flu in pigs causes symptoms that are similar to flu in humans: a respiratory infection that may include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes. Swine flu viruses spread year-round in pigs. But just like influenza in people, cases of swine flu usually occur more commonly in late fall and winter. Infections with flu viruses that spread from pigs to people happen every year, often at agricultural fairs. In July 2024, swine flu was reported in a child in Colorado and an adult in Michigan. The child developed an infection after attending an agricultural event. They did not require hospital caer for the infection. Public health experts are still investigating the cause of infection in the person in  Ingham County , Michigan. Some people are at higher risk of serious illness from    zoonotic diseases  like swine flu:  children younger than age 5 years;  people with certain long-term health conditions like asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions; pregnant women and  people age 65 years and older. How does swine flu spread to people? Rarely, swine flu spreads from pigs to people and on occasion, people can spread flu to pigs! Most commonly, infected pigs spread the virus to people who have direct or indirect contact with:  pig saliva, urine, feces, blood other fluids,  scratches and bites from a pig, or by eating or drinking contaminated food or water (for example, eating or drinking with unclean hands after touching a pig at a fair). However, if meat from pigs is    handled and prepared  properly, there is no evidence that you will catch swine flu by    eating pork .  Infections that spread to people often occur through close contact with infected pigs. For example, the virus has spread in pig barns and at livestock exhibits at fairs. The virus can spread through the air when infected pigs cough or sneeze. People also can get infected from droplets of infected pigs that land in their nose or mouth and if they breathe infected droplets in the air. The infection also can spread to a person if they touch a surface with virus on it and then touch their mouth or nose.  Most of the time, even if the varieties of flu found in birds and swine do infect a person, it is not common for those people to spread the virus to others. But if you are at high risk for zoonotic diseases such as swine flu and you plan to attend a fair where pigs are present, you should avoid direct contact with pigs or their barns.  What precautions can families take if they have contact with pigs? People who have contact with pigs should follow precautions to avoid the spread of germs:  Do not eat or drink or put anything in your mouth in pig barns or show arenas.  Do not take toys, pacifiers, cups, bottles, strollers or similar items into pig barns and show arenas. ­ Make sure children wash their hands with soap and water or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer gel after touching pigs, corrals or fences, food and water dishes and other surfaces.  2009 swine flu pandemic: lessons learned Swine flu from the influenza A virus has caused a pandemic in humans in the past. For example,    in 2009 , a new flu virus that was originally in swine was identified in California. It quickly spread throughout the country and the rest of the world.  All ages of people were infected. Children and young adults were at higher risk—possibly because they were less likely to have immunity from a past infection. To control the pandemic, the United States used    effective strategies , including:  Short-term school closure: 600,000 children from 980 schools were affected.  Vaccination and antivirals: An H1N1 influenza vaccine and antiviral drugs (oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and baloxavir) were made available. In total, 60 million people were infected, 274,000 were hospitalized and 12,469 died from the virus in the United States. It took a combination of public health measures to ease the pandemic. H1N1 viruses continue to circulate to this day.

The flu can spread rapidly through communities, as the virus is passed person to person. When someone with the flu coughs or sneezes, the influenza virus gets into the air. Then, people nearby, including children, can inhale it through the nose or mouth. The virus also can be spread when people touch a contaminated hard surface, such as a door handle, and then put their hands or fingers in their nose or mouth, or rub their eyes.\t This article is also available in other languages. See links to download at bottom. When is flu season? The flu season usually starts in the fall and can last until the end of spring. Ideally, children should get an annual flu shot as soon as it is available, ideally no later than the end of October.      (See \t   \"Which Flu Vaccine Should Children Get?\" ) When there is an outbreak or epidemic, usually during the winter months, the illness tends to be most frequent in preschool or school-aged children. Flu viruses are known to spread quickly among      college students and teens , too. In the first few days of illness, the virus is easily transmitted to other children, parents and caregivers.      It is important for anyone age      6 months old  and older to get the flu vaccine each year. Everyone age 6 months and older should also get COVID-19 vaccines. The COVID vaccine and flu vaccine can safely be given      at the same time  or at any time one after the other.      Flu symptoms include: A sudden            fever  (usually above 100.4°F or 38°C) Chills Headache, body aches, and being a lot more tired than usual Sore throat Dry, hacking cough Stuffy, runny nose Some children may throw up (vomit) and have loose stools ( diarrhea ). After the first few days of these symptoms, a sore throat, stuffy nose, and continuing cough become most evident. The flu can last a week or even longer. A child with a      common cold  usually has only a low-grade fever, a runny nose, and only a small amount of coughing. Children with the flu—or adults, for that matter—usually feel much sicker, achier and more miserable than those with just a cold.       Kids with chronic health conditions at greater risk \t An y child can develop severe, life-threatening influenza. But some are at especially high risk for developing complications from the flu. They include children with an underlying chronic medical condition, such as lung, heart, or kidney disease, an immune system condition, cancer, diabetes, some blood diseases or conditions of the muscular or central nervous system.        \t   These children may have more severe disease or complications. It is important for them to be vaccinated and, when possible, avoid other childre n with the flu or flu-like symptoms. Their pediatrician may suggest other precautions that should be taken.        \t   If your child has any of these chronic health conditions and flu-like \t symptoms along with any difficulty breathing, seek medical attention right away. \t There can be serious complications, even death, from the flu, but thanks to the flu vaccine these are less common. Flu treatment Children may benefit from extra rest and drinking lots of fluids when they get the flu. If your child is uncomfortable because of a fever,      acetaminophen  or      ibuprofen  in doses recommended by your pediatrician for his age and weight will help him feel better. Ibuprofen is approved for use in children age 6 months and older; however, it should never be given to children who are      dehydrated or who are vomiting continuously . It is extremely important never to give aspirin to a child who has the flu or is suspected of having the flu. Aspirin during bouts of influenza is associated with an increased risk of developing      Reye syndrome .      Antiviral medicine for the flu: available by prescription Your pediatrician can help decide whether or not to treat the flu with an      antiviral  medicine. Antiviral medicine works best if started within the first one to two days of showing signs of the flu. However, in some children with increased risk for influenza complications, treatment could be started later. \t Call your pediatrician within 24 hours of the first flu symptom to ask about antiviral medications if your child: Has an underlying health problem like asthma or other chronic lung disease, a heart condition, diabetes, sickle cell disease, a weakened immune system, a neuromuscular condition such as cerebral palsy, or other medical conditions. Is younger than 5 years old, especially if less than 2 years old. Has symptoms that are not improving. Is in contact with others who are at risk for complications of the flu. How long does the flu last?      Healthy people, especially children, get over the flu in about a week, without any lingering problems. Talk with your child's doctor if you suspect a complication like ear pain, pressure in your child's face and head, or a cough and fever that will not go away. When flu becomes an emergency  If your child has the flu and develops any of these symptoms, contact your pediatrician or seek immediate medical care.      Trouble breathing or unusually rapid breathing Pale, gray or blue-colored skin, lips or nail beds, depending on skin tone Ribs looking like they               pull in with each breath Chest pain Muscle pain so severe that your child refuses to walk Dehydration (no peeing for 8 hours, dry mouth, and no tears when crying) While awake, your child is not alert or interacting with you Seizures Fever above 104°F In children less than 12 weeks, any fever Fever or cough that seem to improve but then return or worsen Worsening chronic medical conditions, such as asthma How to prevent the flu Everyone needs the flu vaccine each year to update their protection and reduce the risk of serious complications. It is the best way to prevent getting the flu. Safe and effective vaccines are made each year. The flu vaccine is especially important for: Children, including infants born preterm, who are 6 months to 5 years of age Children of any age with chronic medical conditions that increase the risk of complications from the flu All contacts and care providers of children with high risk conditions and children under 5 years old People who are         pregnant , are considering pregnancy, have recently delivered, or are breastfeeding during the flu season. This is to protect the parent and the baby, which is important since newborns and infants under 6 months old are not able to receive their own vaccination. All health care workers Flu vaccine Both the inactivated (killed) vaccine, also called the \"flu shot,\" given by injection in the muscle, and the live-attenuated nasal spray vaccine, can be used for influenza vaccination this season. There is no preference for a product or formulation. Any of these vaccines should be given as available in your area.  The vaccine boosts your body’s immune system to protect you from the virus. This takes about two weeks after getting vaccinated. Getting vaccinated before the flu starts spreading around will keep your family healthy so they can continue to enjoy the activities that help them thrive.\t   Flu vaccine side effects The flu vaccine has few side effects. The most common side effects from the flu shot are fever and redness, soreness or swelling at the injection site. The most common side effects from the nasal spray vaccine are runny nose, congestion and sore throat. Children with egg allergies can receive the flu vaccine. Children with a previous allergic reaction after a dose of flu vaccine should be seen by an allergist. The allergist can help parents decide if their child should receive an annual flu vaccination.

        "content": "By: Kristina Bryant, MD, FAAP Many people don't realize how serious influenza ( flu ) illness can be, even for previously healthy kids and teens. (See \" Why Flu Vaccines Top Our Back-to-School List Each Year ,\" below.) Children also play a role in spreading the flu in their homes and communities.     \t Last flu season started earlier than usual. By October 2022, a    record number of children  under age 4 years were hospitalized with the flu—the most in 10 years. As a parent, the best thing you can do to protect your children and others from the flu is to get them vaccinated.  \t Influenza viruses change yearly. All children age 6 months and older need a flu shot every year. C hildren should get their influenza vaccine when the shots become available, especially if they need two shots this season. That way they will be protected before flu starts circulating in your community. It takes about two weeks after the shot to build immunity.  Which flu vaccines are available? There are two types of influenza vaccines available. The first is what many people call the \"flu shot.\" The second comes as a nasal spray. All the vaccines available for children this year protect against four different influenza viruses (two A and two B viruses). During flu season, multiple different flu viruses may circulate. Sometimes the viruses change during the flu season. Should I get the shot or nasal spray for my child this year? The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) want as many children as possible to get a flu vaccine every year. Both types of flu vaccine (flu shot or nasal spray) can be given according to their indications for this flu season. Any licensed influenza vaccine available this year and appropriate for a child's age and health status can be given, with no preference.  Can kids get a flu vaccine and other vaccinations at the same time? Yes. Each year, it is possible that    flu, COVID-19, and other common viruses  will spread at the same time. Sometimes, the vaccine is not an exact match with the strains in the community. But the vaccine still can protect against serious illness. Talk with your pediatrician about your child getting the flu vaccine along with other recommended immunizations. Flu vaccine can also be given at the same visit as nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody indicated for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.    Learn more here .    If my child tested positive for COVID, when should they get a flu vaccine? Children with COVID should get a flu vaccine after they have recovered from their COVID illness. Keep in mind that symptoms such as a stuffy and runny nose can make it hard to give the nasal spray vaccine. What about allergies to flu vaccines? A child who had an allergic reaction after a flu vaccine in the past should be seen by an allergist. The allergist can help parents decide if their child should receive their annual flu vaccination. A child with a known history of egg allergy can receive the flu vaccine without any additional precautions beyond those recommended for all vaccines.\t   Why Flu Vaccines Top Our Back-to-School List Each Year\t By Jennifer Pool Miller \t Our daughter, Caroline, was very active, physically fit and healthy. She swam several times a week and participated in weekly gymnastics lessons. She had been vaccinated against the flu every year, except one. When she was 5 years old, influenza nearly stole her life. That year, the vaccine wasn't readily available prior to the beginning of school. Once the busy school year began, a flu shot fell off our radar.  As winter break approached, Caroline came home from school with the sniffles and a mild cough. She has mild asthma and occasionally uses a nebulizer. But as the evening progressed, Caroline's breathing became more labored than usual. We called her pediatrician, who advised us to alternate doses of her asthma medications and to keep in touch. But by 1 a.m. her condition had worsened. The pediatrician urged us to take Caroline to the hospital, just to be safe.  Caroline was diagnosed with influenza A and double pneumonia. Doctors placed her on oxygen and monitored her breathing. She was transferred by ambulance to another hospital with a dedicated pediatric unit, but she slipped into life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome and needed to be transported by helicopter to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. She faced a long and frightening list of complications: flu, pneumonia, severe sepsis, septic shock, hypoxemia and was at risk of cardiorespiratory failure. For the next two weeks, Caroline remained in a medication-induced coma, intubated, and on an oscillating ventilator at the pediatric intensive care unit. Finally, on Christmas Day, Caroline's condition started to take a turn for the better. The recovery process was agonizing, with two steps forward and one step back. And after a long three weeks, she was able to go home.  We are fortunate that our daughter was able to fight her way back. Her experience has changed our entire family's lives forever. I now encourage families to consider the flu shot a back-to-school essential. \t Jennifer Pool Miller \t serves as treasurer for \t   Families Fighting Flu , a national nonprofit organization dedicated to saving lives and reducing hospitalizations by protecting children and their families against flu through education and advocacy. A \t   strong advocate  for annual flu vaccination, joined Families Fighting Flu in 2013 after her daughter Caroline's frightening battle with the flu. Her family established the Caroline Miller Endowed \t   Fund  for Nursing Education and \"Katie and Caroline P.I.C. YOU!\" Award at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to support continuing education for nurses, in honor of the integral role the CHOP nursing staff played in Caroline's care and recovery.\t Where should I go for my child's flu shot? Many pediatricians offer flu shot clinics, including curbside and drive-through clinics. The pediatrician's office has your child's health information. That makes it easy to keep track of the flu shot in your child's health record. If they get a flu shot somewhere else, remember to share this information with the pediatrician so the vaccination is included in your child's health record. Don't let the flu stop you and your family! Most people who get the flu are sick for at least a week. But some people get much sicker. Getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent influenza and the    serious complications  that can result from it—especially for those with high-risk conditions like asthma. For example, flu can lead to pneumonia. Kids with flu also can develop brain inflammation as well as    febrile  and non-febrile    seizures . The flu vaccine keeps people out of the hospital—it stops serious illness and deaths from influenza.\t Influenza causes thousands of deaths in the United States every year.  In the last 10 flu seasons, the number of children who died from flu in a season has ranged from 1 child in 2020-2021 to 199 children in 2019-2020. Before the pandemic, the 2011-2012 season had the lowest number — 37 pediatric deaths from flu. Even children who are otherwise healthy and have no other medical conditions can be hospitalized with flu and develop life-threatening complications. There's no need to wait, even if your child received the previous year's flu vaccine in March or April. Children 6 months to 8 years of age should receive two doses if this is the first time they are being vaccinated against influenza, or if they have only received one dose of flu vaccine ever before July 1. The doses are given four weeks apart. If your child is 8 years old and requires 2 doses of influenza vaccine, they should receive both doses even if they turn 9 years old between dose 1 and dose 2. We have a vaccine for flu, unlike many other respiratory viruses that make kids sick. Let's protect our children from flu when we can.

They can travel 10 to 15 feet to feed and go without feeding for up to 6 months. They cause  itchy bites . Bedbugs are not known to spread disease.\t Signs or Symptoms of Bedbugs  Itchy insect bites, which often occur in a row, on areas of skin that are exposed during the night. Bites often have a red dot where the bite occurred in the middle of a raised red bump.\t Bites typically occur on face, neck, arms, and hands.\t Look for specks of blood, rusty spots from crushed bugs, or dung spots the size of a pen point on bed sheets and mattresses or behind loose wallpaper.\t Look for reddish/brown live bugs, about 1/8 of an inch, in crevices or seems of bedding.\t Incubation and Contagious Periods  Bedbugs do not reproduce on humans like  scabies  or  lice . They bite humans at night, then hide in cracks or crevices on mattresses, cushions, or bed frames during the day. How Bedbugs are Spread  Bedbugs are not spread on people. They are not a sign that people are dirty. They do need to feed on people and may hide in belongings or clothing that allow them to spread to others in  group care settings . They crawl at the speed of a ladybug. How to Control Bedbugs\t Avoid overreacting. One bedbug is not an infestation. For example, it is not necessary to send a child home from child care. An inspection and any pesticide application should be done by a trained pest control operator.\t Educate your family about bedbugs.\t Reduce clutter and limit items that travel back and forth between home and school, child care facility, etc.\t Seal cracks. Clean up any bedbug debris with  detergent and water .\t Extermination involves vacuuming and one of the following approaches:\t Application of the least toxic (preferably “bio-based”) products, heating the living area to 122°F (50°C) for about 90 minutes, freezing infested articles, or (if necessary) use of synthetic chemical insecticides.\t Use  Integrated Pest Management , which involves a combination of nonchemical strategies such as maintenance and sanitation followed by pesticides, if other methods are not effective.\t Wash bedding and clothing (hot water and hot drying cycle for 30–60 minutes), vacuum cracks and crevices, and freeze articles that may have been used as hiding places for bedbugs may reduce infestation until extermination can be performed. Vacuum with special attention to cracks and crevices in furniture, equipment, walls, and floors. Vacuuming some talcum powder will reduce the chance that the bugs will crawl out of the vacuum cleaner. Dispose of the vacuum cleaner filter and bags in a tightly sealed plastic bag.\t Use mattress, box spring, and pillow encasements to trap bedbugs. These encasements are readily available by searching the Internet for “mattress or pillow encasement.” They are marketed for bedbug or allergy control.\t  \t Additional Resources:\t Preventing the Spread of Illness in Child Care and School\t Cleaners, Sanitizers and Disinfectants\t www.epa.gov/bedbugs  (Environmental Protection Agency) - good resource for identifying and controlling bedbugs.",

        "content": "You may find it hard to believe that a small household  pet  like a cat can cause your child to become ill for a long period of time. A common bacterial infection called cat-scratch disease (CSD) can make your youngster sick for weeks or even months, all because, as the name suggests, a cat has bitten or scratched him. Most cases occur in people younger than 20 years.\t Cat-scratch disease is caused by an organism called Bartonella henselae, which is transmitted to humans by cats (usually kittens) that appear healthy, but are infected with this bacteria. The disease spreads from cat to cat by fleas, but cannot be transmitted from person to person. It takes a week or more from the time a person is scratched for the first symptoms to appear, sometimes as long as a month and a half. \t Signs and Symptoms\t The most common sign of CSD is one or more swollen lymph nodes or glands, a condition called lymphadenopathy. The affected lymph nodes may be in your child’s armpit, on his neck, or in the area of the groin. In most cases, children have a small sore on the skin where the cat scratch or bite occurred. This bump usually appears 1 to 2 weeks before the lymph nodes become swollen and can last for many weeks. \t The skin over the swollen lymph nodes is warm, reddened, hardened, and tender to the touch. Children may also have a  fever ,  headaches , tiredness, and a decreased appetite. \t In a small number of cases, children with CSD—typically those who also have a weak immune system because of  cancer ,  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV ), or an organ transplantation—may develop infections in other parts of the body. Some children with normal immune systems develop infections in the liver and spleen. These children have prolonged fever, which is called fever of unknown origin. Rarely, a child with CSD develops brain inflammation (encephalitis), inflammation of the retina of the eye, a bone infection,  pneumonia , or tender purple-red bumps on the skin (erythema nodosum). \t An unusual complication called Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome occurs when the bacteria enters the body through the eyelid. In this case, the eyelid lining, the white of the eye (conjunctiva), or both are red. The lymph node in front of the ear on the same side of the infected eye will be swollen. \t What You Can Do\t If a cat scratches or bites your child, immediately wash the area with soap and water. \t When to Call Your Pediatrician?\t Contact your pediatrician if your child develops swollen lymph nodes. This swelling can have a number of causes, including CSD. \t How is the Diagnosis Made?\t Your pediatrician will ask whether your child has had exposure to cats and kittens. The pediatrician will look for a small bump where the cat scratch has occurred and evaluate any swollen lymph nodes that may be present. Laboratory tests are available to detect antibodies in the blood related to CSD, but many commercial tests are considered unreliable. In most cases, your pediatrician will not use this test. \t Treatment\t Your pediatrician may recommend treatments aimed at easing the symptoms of CSD in your child. For example, if your youngster has a painful, pus-filled lymph node, the doctor may drain the pus with a needle to make your child more comfortable. \t Antibiotics  may speed recovery. \t What is the Prognosis?\t Cat-scratch disease is self-limited, meaning that the infection and the lymph node swelling will usually go away on their own in 2 to 4 months, even without treatment. \t Prevention\t Do not allow your child to play roughly with cats and kittens. This kind of play can increase the chances of a scratch or bite. Teach your child how to interact with animals. A child should never try to take food away from a cat and should avoid teasing, petting, or trying to capture stray cats.",

        "content": "The infection  toxoplasmosis  is caused by the Toxoplasma gondii parasite. Cats are the usual host for these parasites, but children, adults, and other animals can also be infected. Humans and animals can become infected if they swallow the microscopic eggs of the parasite or eat cysts in undercooked meats from cattle, sheep, pigs, or wild animals such as deer. \t The T gondii parasite can only mature to an adult in the body of a cat. The adult parasite lives in the gut of cats, and the eggs enter the environment through the cat feces. The eggs must mature in the soil for 1 to 5 days before they become contagious for people or other animals. When a person or an animal other than a cat eats the mature egg, it hatches within the bowel and burrows through the bowel wall. When the parasite is in a human (the non-preferred host), it cannot mature to an adult, but instead becomes a cyst in a muscle or organ. These cysts can become reactivated later in life, especially if a person’s immune system is weakened by illness or medicines. \t Humans can get the parasite by: \t Eating raw or undercooked meat that contains cysts \t Drinking untreated water contaminated with mature eggs \t Eating unwashed fruits and vegetables grown in contaminated soil \t Touching your mouth with your hand after handling soil or sand that contains mature eggs \t If a  pregnant woman  becomes infected with T gondii, she can pass the infection to her unborn fetus. \t Signs and Symptoms \t When the parasite is passed from the pregnant mother to the unborn fetus, the infections are less frequent but more severe early in pregnancy, and more frequent but less severe in the later months. Most infants born with toxoplasmosis have no signs or symptoms at birth. \t Some babies will have signs and symptoms that include: \t Rash \t Swollen lymph glands \t Jaundice \t Low number of blood platelets \t Enlargement of the liver and spleen \t Tiredness \t Although 70% to 90% of the infants born with toxoplasmosis do not have any signs or symptoms at birth, serious complications caused by inflammation of the eye and brain often appear in the ensuing months and years. These can include  vision problems , varying levels of  developmental delay ,  seizures ,  deafness , and blockage of cerebrospinal fluid pathways in the brain leading to hydrocephalus. Some infected fetuses may die in the uterus or within the first few days after birth. \t When children or adults develop toxoplasmosis, illness is uncommon. When it does occur, it may look similar to infectious mononucleosis and include: \t Fever  \t Swollen lymph glands, particularly in the region of the neck \t Headache \t Muscle aches and pains \t Sore throat \t Enlargement of the liver and spleen \t General feelings of being ill \t A pregnant woman with toxoplasmosis may be symptom free, but she can still pass the infection to her unborn baby. This is most common when the infection occurs near the end of the pregnancy. \t People with weakened immune systems can develop blindness because of cysts within the retina (the part of the eye involved in vision).  Meningitis  or  encephalitis  may be caused by cysts within the brain. Other complications include  pneumonia  or, less often, widespread infection involving many organs in the body. \t How Is the Diagnosis Made? \t The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is made by blood tests that can detect antibodies to the parasite. These tests can be difficult to perform and interpret and should be done with the guidance of specialists in this field. \t If you are pregnant and believe you may have become infected with T gondii, ask your doctor to test you for the presence of this parasite. \t Treatment \t Older children  and  teenagers  with a normal immune system do not require specific medical treatment for toxoplasmosis unless they are pregnant. All infected newborns should be treated to avoid eye problems and inflammation of the brain. Patients with a weakened immune system usually require treatment. Your pediatrician will often call in a specialist in infectious diseases to help decide on management. \t The most common medicines used are a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine or clindamycin. Treatment continues for several months. Newborns may require treatment for a year. Pyrimethamine is always given with folinic acid (leucovorin) to prevent damage to the liver and bone marrow. In certain patients, corticosteroids may be prescribed for eye problems caused by the infection. \t What Is the Prognosis? \t Early treatment can be very successful for babies who are infected before birth, although many will develop eye or brain problems despite treatment. \t Toxoplasmosis acquired after birth generally goes away on its own without any lasting complications. However, if your child has a weakened immune system because of, for example, a  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)  infection or  cancer chemotherapy , she is more likely to develop a severe form of the disease that can damage the brain, eyes, or other organs. \t Prevention \t Pregnant women should not change cat litter boxes or do any gardening and landscaping to avoid being exposed to cat feces, which may contain these parasites. If these activities are unavoidable, wear gloves and wash your hands thoroughly afterward. If you do catch toxoplasmosis, early treatment can prevent many of the complications to the fetus. \t To reduce the chances of ingesting foods with T gondii, cook all meat— beef, pork, lamb, and wild game—to an internal temperature of 150°F to 170°F until the meat is no longer pink. \t Also, follow these recommendations: \t Wash or peel all fruits and vegetables. \t Take steps to prevent contaminating other foods with raw or undercooked meat. \t Wash your hands , cutting boards, other kitchen surfaces, and kitchen cutlery and utensils after handling and preparing raw meat, fruits, and vegetables. \t Wash your hands after gardening or having other contact with soil or sand in sandboxes. \t To reduce the chances that your pet cats will become infected, feed them only commercially made cat food. Keep them from eating undercooked kitchen meat scraps or hunting wild rodents. Cats who go outdoors may be exposed to soil contaminated by eggs from infected cats’ feces.",

        "content": "​Infectious diseases spread by insects are a major cause of illnesses to children and adults worldwide. Here are 4 diseases spread by insects.  West Nile virus West Nile virus is spread by mosquitoes. In the United States, West Nile virus and outbreaks of various types of encephalitis (brain swelling) get plenty of media coverage.  Symptoms  Most cases of West Nile virus infection are mild. People may have no symptoms or mild symptoms such as fever, headache, and body aches.  Less common symptoms, occurring mostly in older adults, may include a severe headache, a high fever, a stiff neck, confusion, seizures, sensitivity to light, muscle weakness, and loss of consciousness. Zika virus Zika virus  is primarily spread by mosquitoes. Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause fetuses to have a birth defect of the brain called microcephaly. Zika virus outbreaks are currently happening in many countries and territories. For up-to-date information about the virus and outbreaks, go to www.cdc.gov/zika.  Symptoms  Many people won't have symptoms or will have only mild symptoms.  Symptoms may include fever, rash, joint pain, or red eyes. Lyme disease Lyme disease  is spread by deer ticks. Deer ticks are tiny, black-brown arachnids about the size of a poppy seed. They are not insects because they have 8 legs (like spiders). Lyme disease is an important health concern in certain regions of the country; the following areas are where most infections occur: Northeast, from Virginia to Maine; north-central states, mostly Wisconsin and Minnesota; and West Coast, particularly northern California.  Symptoms Often the first and most obvious symptom of Lyme disease is a localized rash that begins as a pink or red circle at the site of tick attachment. This circle expands over time and may become several inches or larger. A classic bull's-eye appearance, with concentric rings, appears in some people. The rash generally occurs 1 to 2 weeks after the tick bite but ranges from 3 days to 30 days.  A rash may occur without any other symptoms or may be associated with   Headache  Chills  Fever  Fatigue  Swollen glands, usually in the neck or groin  Aches and pains in the muscles or joints If you live in an area of the country endemic to Lyme disease and your child develops a suspicious rash with or without any of these symptoms, call your child's doctor.  Rocky Mountain spotted fever Rocky Mountain spotted fever  is spread by ticks. Despite the name, Rocky Mountain spotted fever currently occurs mostly in other regions of the United States, including North and South Carolina, Oklahoma, and Tennessee.  Symptoms Most people get a red, dot-like rash that begins on the wrists and ankles and spreads toward the center of the body. The illness may be severe or fatal in some people.  Other symptoms may include severe headache, fever, muscle aches, nausea, or vomiting. If your child has been bitten by an insect and shows any of the symptoms of West Nile virus infection, Zika virus infection, Lyme disease, or Rocky Mountain spotted fever, call your child's doctor.  Remember Children need and love to be outdoors. The chance of your children becoming infected by insects and ticks is quite low, especially when you take steps to  reduce the risk of bites . If you have any concerns about insect or tick bites, talk with your child's pediatrician.  More information Choosing an Insect Repellent for Your Child",

Read on to find out what's true—and false—about current treatment options. True or false? Over-the-counter (OTC) head lice treatments sometimes are not the most effective.\t True. Here's why:  Head lice can be resistant to the active ingredients in over the counter (OTC) treatments in some communities. These are the ones you can buy in the store without a prescription. If head lice are resistant it means the treatments may not kill them. The likelihood of resistance varies across the country. Your pediatrician can help you choose an appropriate treatment option for your child. Prescription treatments always cost more than OTC treatments. \t False. Here's why:  Parents sometimes treat their children with OTC treatments up to 5 times before seeking help from their pediatrician. You should consider the cost of potential multiple treatments. That said, though, prescription medications are usually more expensive to purchase and may not always be covered by health insurance. So, it is a good idea to check your coverage when you are making your decision. All head lice treatments call for 2 applications.\t False. Here's why:  Several prescription treatments suggest using only 1 application. Sometimes, a third treatment is needed if live lice persist following the second treatment. Prescription head lice treatments involve being left on the scalp and hair for 8 to 12 hours. \t False. Here's why:  Some prescription products have application times as short as 10 minutes followed by a simple rinse with water. That is why it is essential for parents to read and follow manufacturer instructions exactly as written. All head lice treatments instruct users to nit comb. \t False. Here's why:  There are some prescription products that don't call for nit combing. Nits are lice eggs. Even when nit combing is not required to get rid of an infestation, you may choose to comb out nits while hair is wet with a fine-tooth comb. Removing nits may help to decrease embarrassment to your child or teen, as well as eliminate potential conflicts with school officials that you have not treated your child. Due to stronger ingredients, prescription head lice treatments should only be used as a last resort.\t False. Here's why:  Prescription medications have different active ingredients than the OTC products and may need to be used in the initial treatment of head lice in some communities based upon local resistance patterns. Many newer prescription treatments can be used safely when prescribed by a pediatrician and carefully applied according to instructions. Several prescription treatments are safe to use on children as young as 6 months of age. Home remedies to treat head lice are safe and effective.\t False. Here's why:  Mayonnaise, olive oil, margarine, butter and similar home \"remedies\" have not been proven as effective head lice treatments. Substances like gasoline or kerosene have not been clinically proven—plus, they are flammable, carrying substantial risk. When your child has head lice, it is best to call your pediatrician before treatment. Like any other health concerns you have about your child, consulting your pediatrician first can help you decide whether an OTC or prescription treatment is best for your child. Once I apply lice treatment, it is ok to place a shower cap or plastic bag on my child's head and leave my child alone until the treatment is complete.\t False. Here's why:  It is dangerous to place anything made of plastic on a child's head because it sends a message that it is ok for them to do when you may not be around. If left unattended a child might fall asleep with the plastic bag on their head, and it could slip over their nose or mouth and suffocate them. While treating for head lice can be an annoyance, it can also be \"found\" time for a parent and child to spend quiet time together and bond during a close and caring encounter. Similarly, a child should never be left unattended with any wet chemicals on their head to avoid the chemicals dripping into the eye.

        "content": "​By: Dawn Nolt, MD, MPH, FAAP Head lice are a common problem, especially among school-aged children and their families. The lice can attach to the hair of anyone's head. It doesn't matter if the hair is clean or dirty. Head lice are also found worldwide in all different places, such as in homes or schools or the country or city. It doesn't matter how clean, dirty, rich or poor the place or person is. Though head lice may be a nuisance, they don't cause serious illness or carry any diseases. Head lice can be treated at home, but it's important to check with the doctor first. (See \" Head Lice Medicines ,\" below).   \t Read on for information to help you check for, treat and prevent the spread of head lice. What are head lice? Head lice are tiny bugs about the size of a sesame seed (2–3 mm long [mm stands for millimeter]). Their bodies are usually pale and gray, but their color may vary. One of these tiny bugs is called a louse. Head lice feed on small amounts of blood from the scalp. They can't survive more than 1 day without a blood meal.\t   What are nits? Lice lay and attach their eggs to hair close to the scalp. The eggs and their shell casings are called nits. Lice eggs are oval and about the size of a knot in thread (0.8 mm long and 0.3 mm wide) and usually yellow to white. Some nits may blend in with some people's hair color, making them hard to see, and are often confused for dandruff or hair spray droplets. Nits attach to the hair with a sticky substance that holds them firmly in place. After the eggs hatch, the empty nits stay on the hair shaft. What is the life cycle of head lice? Head lice live about 28 days. They develop in 3 phases: egg (also called a nit), nymph, and adult louse.\t Egg or nit.  Eggs or nits hatch in 7 to 12 days, depending on the surrounding temperature. Eggs are usually found within 4 to 6 mm of the scalp and do not survive if they are farther away.\t Nymph.  The nymph looks like an adult head louse but is much smaller (about the size of a pinhead [1.5 mm]). Nymphs become adults about 9-12 days after hatching.\t Adult louse.  An adult female louse can lay up to 10 eggs a day. It takes only about 12 to 14 days for newly hatched eggs to reach adulthood. This cycle can repeat every 3 weeks if head lice are left untreated. How common are head lice? Head lice are most common in preschool- and elementary school–aged children. Each year millions of school-aged children in the United States get head lice. However, anyone can get head lice. Head lice are found worldwide. How do head lice spread? Head lice are crawling insects. They cannot jump, hop, or fly. The main way that head lice spread is from close, prolonged head-to-head contact. There is a very small chance that head lice will spread by sharing items such as combs, brushes, hats and sports helmets. What are symptoms of head lice? Itching on the areas where head lice are present is the most common    symptom . However, it may take up to 4 to 6 weeks after lice get on the scalp before the scalp becomes sensitive to the lice saliva and begins to itch. Most of the itching happens behind the ears or at the back of the neck. Also, itching caused by head lice can last for weeks, even after the lice are gone. How do you check for head lice? Regular checks for head lice are a good way to spot head lice before they have time to multiply and infest (are present in large numbers) your child's head. Seat your child in a brightly lit room. Part their hair. Look for crawling lice and for nits on your child's scalp a section at a time.  Live lice are hard to find. They avoid light and move quickly. Nits will look like small white or yellow-brown specks and be firmly attached to the hair near the scalp. The easiest place to find them is at the hairline at the back of the neck or behind the ears. Nits can be confused with many other things such as dandruff, dirt particles or hair spray droplets. The way to tell the difference is that nits are firmly attached to hair, while dandruff, dirt or other particles are not. Use a fine-tooth comb (such as a louse or nit comb) to help you search the scalp section by section. What is the comb-out method for lice? The comb-out method can be used to help check for nits and head lice or to help remove nits and head lice after head lice treatment. However, the comb-out method usually doesn't work on its own to get rid of head lice. Here is how you use the comb-out method:\t Step 1:  Wet your child's hair.\t Step 2:  Use a fine-tooth comb (louse or nit comb) and comb through your child's hair in small sections.\t Step 3:  After each comb-through, wipe the comb on a wet paper towel. Examine the scalp, comb, and paper towel carefully.\t Step 4:  Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you've combed through all of your child's hair. How do you treat head lice? Check with your child's doctor before beginning any    head lice treatment . The most effective way to treat head lice is with head lice medicine. After each treatment, using the comb-out method every 2 to 3 days for 2 to 3 weeks may help remove the nits and eggs.\t Head lice medicine should be used only when it is certain that your child has living head lice.  Remember, check with your child's doctor before starting any head lice medicine. Also, when head lice medicines are used, it is important to use them safely as directed. Here are some safety guidelines for lice treatments:\t Follow the directions  on the package exactly as written.\t Never let children apply the medicine.  Medicine should be applied by an adult.\t Always rinse the medicine off over a sink  and not during a shower or bath, so the medicine doesn't run off the head onto other areas of skin. Place your child's head over a sink and rinse the medicine off with warm water (not hot water).\t Never place a plastic bag on a child's head.\t Do not leave a child alone  with medicine in his or her hair.\t Store medicine in a locked cabinet , out of sight and reach of children.\t Check with your child's doctor before beginning a second or third medicine.  Your child may just need to repeat the same medication, or switch to a new one.\t Ask your child's doctor if you have any questions  or if treatments you have tried have not gotten rid of lice. Warning about dangerous home remedies for lice Never use dangerous products like gasoline or kerosene or medicines made for use on animals! Also, do not use home remedies, such as petroleum jelly, mayonnaise, tub margarine, essential oils or olive oil, because no studies prove they work. What head lice medicines are available?

You do not need to throw these items away. Items that cannot be washed may be sealed in a plastic bag for 2 weeks or dry-cleaned..\t Do not spray pesticides in your home.  They can expose your family to dangerous chemicals and are not needed when you treat your child's scalp and hair properly.\t All household members and close contacts should be checked  and treated for head lice if necessary. About school \"no-nit\" policies Some schools have \"no-nit\" policies stating that students who still have nits in their hair cannot return to school. The American Academy of Pediatrics and National Association of School Nurses discourage such policies and believe a child should not miss or be excluded from school because of head lice. Remember Head lice don't put your child at risk for any serious health problems. Products should be used only if those products are safe. If your child has head lice, work quickly but safely to treat your child to prevent the head lice from spreading.

        "content": "Hookworms are small (less than 0.5 inches long) parasitic worms that can cause  infections  in the small intestines. The major species of hookworms associated with infections in humans are Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. They get their name from the teeth (“hooks”) or cutting plates in their mouths by which they attach themselves to the intestinal wall. \t Hookworm diseases are most common in tropical and subtropical climates. These infections develop after a person has contact with soil contaminated with human feces. Children are at high risk because they often play barefoot in areas with contaminated soil. In soil, hookworm eggs hatch and form larvae, which then burrow through the skin of a person’s foot and crawl into the blood. The blood carries the larvae to the lungs, where they enter into the air sacs. The hookworms then crawl up the breathing tubes to the throat, where they are swallowed. The larvae pass through the stomach and mature into adult worms in the bowel. The worm holds onto the bowel wall with hooks, which cause minor bleeding. Adult hookworms live in the bowel and lay eggs that pass out of the child with the stool.\t Signs and Symptoms\t Most children with hookworm infections have no signs or symptoms. However, especially when the infection is long term, it can cause  iron deficiency and anemia  (low red blood cells) because of bleeding from the bowel wall where the worm is attached. Other symptoms include mild  diarrhea  and stomach cramps. An itchy, red skin rash (ground itch) can appear on the feet where the larvae entered the body. Lung inflammation with cough, wheezing, and fever rarely occur while the larvae migrate through the lungs. Several weeks after exposure to this hookworm, a loss of appetite and weight loss may occur. Chronic infections can lead to poor nutrition.\t How Is the Diagnosis Made?\t A stool sample from your child will be tested in the laboratory to look for evidence of hookworm eggs. \t Treatment\t Antiparasitic drugs are used to treat hookworm infections. The  oral medicines  commonly prescribed include a single dose of albendazole or 3 days of mebendazole or pyrantel. One to 2 weeks following treatment, your pediatrician may test another stool sample from your child. The drug therapy should be repeated if the infection persists. \t Iron supplements help replace the iron your child has lost. \t What Is the Prognosis?\t Proper treatment of hookworm infections results in a high recovery rate. \t How Is the Diagnosis Made?\t Reinfection is common. Wearing shoes prevents the larvae from entering the body through the feet. If your child goes barefoot, make sure she avoids contact with soil that may be contaminated with human feces.",

Tips Keep Your Child Safe From Insect Stings: Check for nests in areas where children play. Nests can be found in old tree stumps, around rotting wood, and in holes in the ground. Check in auto tires that are part of a playground. Look around trash cans. Have insect nests removed by a professional exterminator. Don’t allow children who are allergic to insects to play outside alone when stinging insects are active. Even a dead insect can sting if a child steps on it or picks it up.  Wear shoes. Avoid wearing sandals or going barefoot.  Avoid wearing bright colors and floral patterns. These can attract insects. Wear white, green, tan, and khaki. These colors are not as attractive to insects.  When eating outdoors, avoid foods that attract insects. Some examples are tuna, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and watermelon. Sweetened drinks, frozen sweet treats, and ice cream also attract insects.  Stay away from garbage cans and dumpsters.  If an insect is near, do not swat at it or run. These actions can trigger an attack. Walk away slowly. If you have disturbed a nest and the insects swarm around you, curl up as tightly as you can to reduce exposed skin. Keep your face down and cover your head with your arms.  A child who is allergic to insects should wear a medical alert necklace or bracelet.

        "content": "If you see a small brown bug attached to your child's skin, it may be a tick. A wood tick (dog tick) is the size of an apple seed. A deer tick is the size of a poppy seed or pinhead. After feeding on blood, ticks can swell to triple their size and are easier to see.  Most tick bites are harmless. However, wood ticks can sometimes pass on  Rocky Mountain spotted fever  or Colorado tick fever and deer ticks can sometimes pass on Lyme disease.  If a tick is still attached to the skin, it will need to be removed. Here's how:  Removing a wood tick Use a tweezers and grasp the tick close to the skin (on its head). Hold the tweezers sideways next to the skin surface. Pull the wood tick straight upward without twisting or crushing it. Maintain a steady pressure until it releases its grip. Other options:  If you don't have tweezers, you can use your fingers.You can also use a loop of thread around the jaws, or a needle pushed between the jaws for traction. Jaws are the part of the head attached to the skin. Not helpful:  Covering the tick with petroleum jelly or nail polish doesn't work. Neither does rubbing alcohol or a soapy cotton ball. Touching the tick with a hot or cold object also doesn't work. How to remove the tick's head If the wood tick's head breaks off in the skin, remove any large parts. Clean the skin with rubbing alcohol. Use a clean tweezers or needle to uncover the head and scrape it off. If a small piece of the head remains, the skin will slowly shed it. Removing a deer tick If a deer tick is swollen, try to remove it with a tweezers. If it is tiny, it needs to be scraped off. Use the edge of a credit card. What to do after you remove a tick After you've removed a wood tick or deer tick, it's important to: Wash the wound  and your hands with soap and water after removal. This helps to prevent catching any disease carried by the tick. Apply an antibiotic ointment  such as Polysporin. No prescription is needed. Put it on the bite once. Tick bite symptoms Tick bites  normally don't itch or hurt. That's often why they may not be noticed. The little bump goes away in 2 days. If the tick transferred a  disease , a rash will occur. It will appear in the next 2 to 4 weeks. Call your pediatrician if: You tried and can't remove the tick Fever or rash happens in the next 4 weeks Bite starts to look infected You think your child needs to be seen Your child becomes worse How likely is Lyme disease from a tick bite The risk of  Lyme disease  after a deer tick bite is low. Even in a high-risk area, the risk is about 2%. Erythema migrans If Lyme disease does develop, most infections (80%) start with a bull's eye rash. The medical name is erythema migrans (EM). The rash starts at the site of the tick bite. EM usually is solid red. Central clearing is present in 30%. EM starts on the average at 7 days. It grows larger quickly to more than 2 inches (5 cm) wide. It lasts 2 or 3 weeks. On the average, Lyme disease starts 7 days after the bite, though it can develop any time between 3–30 days. Treatment of erythema migrans with an antibiotic is advised. This almost always prevents the development of later stages of Lyme Disease. Arthritis, heart disease and neurologic disease can occur if Lyme Disease is not treated. Are antibiotics needed after a tick bite? Giving an antibiotic after a deer tick bite to prevent Lyme disease depends on the risk. The risk is low with brief attachment. An antibiotic is not needed. The risk is high if the deer tick was attached for longer than 36 hours. It's also high if the tick is swollen, not flat. An antibiotic may be needed. Your doctor will help you decide. How to help prevent tick bites There are steps families can take to reduce the risk of tick bites: Cover up When    hiking  in tick-infested areas, wear long clothing. Tuck the ends of pants into socks. Do tick checks at the end of each day.  Early removal of ticks within 36 hours can prevent Lyme disease. Tick repellent for clothing: permethrin Permethrin-containing products (such as Duranon, Permanone Tick Spray) are very good tick repellents. An advantage over using DEET is that permethrin is used on clothing. Put it on clothes, especially pants, cuffs, socks and shoes. You can also put it on other outdoor items (mosquito screen, sleeping bags). Do not put Permethrin on skin. Reason: it loses its ability to work once in contact with skin).  Tick repellent for skin: DEET DEET  is a good tick repellent. It can be used on skin not covered by clothing. Use 30% DEET for children and teens. Deet is approved for use in children over 2 months of age. Note: DEET protects for 6 hours.

Bites result in stinging sensation followed by a small, red, itchy mound with a tiny puncture mark at the center. Flies Usually found near or around food, garbage, and animal waste. Painful, itchy bumps that may turn into small blisters are characteristic of bites. These bites often disappear in a day but may last longer. Fleas Flea bites are usually identified by the presence of multiple small bumps clustered together, –often where clothes fit tightly (waist, buttocks). Fleas are commonly found in floors, rugs, and are mostly likely to be problematic in homes with pets. Bedbugs Bedbugs are usually found in cracks in walls or floors, crevices of furniture and bedding. Bedbug bites are characterized by itchy red bumps (which are occasionally topped by a blister) usually 2–3 in a row. Bites are more likely to occur at night. Bedbugs are less active in cold weather. Fire Ants Immediate pain and burning sensation is frequently experienced after a bite followed by swelling (up to ½ inch) and cloudy fluid in area of bite. Fire ants usually attack intruders and are commonly found in pastures, meadows, lawns and parks in southern states. Bees and Wasps These winged insects are usually found near flowers, shrubs, picnic areas, or beaches. Immediate pain and rapid swelling occur following a sting. A few children have severe reactions, –such as difficulty breathing and hives/swelling all over their body. Ticks Ticks are found in wooded areas. They may be unnoticeably hidden on hair or on skin. When attempting to remove a tick do not use matches, lit cigarettes, or nail polish remover. Grasp the tick near the head with tweezers, and gently pull the tick straight out.",

        "content": "Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by species of  Leptospira  organisms that can infect domestic and wild animals. The bacteria is excreted in the animal’s urine and can survive in the soil or water for weeks or months. Humans can then become infected from the contaminated soil or water, often during activities like swimming or canoeing in lakes or rivers. The bacteria enter the body through cuts in the skin; through the nose, eyes, or mouth (mucosal membranes); or by swallowing contaminated water. It is very rare for the infection to spread from person to person. The time from exposure to the bacteria until beginning of illness is about a week, but sometimes can take as long as a month. Leptospirosis is an uncommon disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 100 to 200 cases are identified each year in the United States, with about half of those cases occurring in Hawaii. It is more common in other parts of the world.\t Signs and Symptoms\t Illness seen with leptospirosis includes:\t Fever and chills\t Headaches\t Muscle soreness in the calves and back\t Redness of the eyes (conjunctivitis)\t Abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting\t Skin rash over the shins (pretibial)\t These symptoms may initially last for 3 to 7 days. Then there may be a short period (for 1 to 3 days) during which the fever goes away, followed by a second phase in which the fever returns, with any of the previously described symptoms as well as increased inflammation of the eye (uveitis, iritis), covering of the brain (meningitis), liver (hepatitis), and lymph nodes. The rash may become worse. At times, leptospirosis can be life threatening (Weil syndrome).When the infection goes untreated, liver infection (hepatitis) with yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), bleeding, kidney failure, irregular heart rhythms, inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis), and a form of pneumonia called hemorrhagic pneumonitis may develop.\t When to Call Your Pediatrician\t Contact your pediatrician if your child has symptoms that suggest the presence of leptospirosis.\t How Is the Diagnosis Made?\t Most often, leptospirosis is diagnosed with antibody testing of blood samples.  \t Treatment\t Your pediatrician will prescribe antibiotics to treat leptospirosis. Children with a mild infection can be treated with oral amoxicillin if they are younger than 8 years. Oral doxycycline is used for children 8 years and older. (In young children, tetracyclines such as doxycycline can cause staining of the teeth.) Some patients with leptospirosis become very ill and should be hospitalized to receive penicillin intravenously.\t What Is the Prognosis? \t This disease can last from a few days to several weeks, but most children fully recover. Even so, some of the serious complications such as brain or spinal cord inflammation or kidney damage can cause lasting health problems. On rare occasions, death may occur.  \t Prevention\t Make sure your child follows good hygiene habits. She should wash her hands frequently and avoid direct contact with the urine of pets and other animals. Your child should not play in and around dirty puddles of standing water in the outdoors. Although there is a vaccine to protect pets from leptospirosis, there is no vaccine approved for use in people.",

Update it with the new form . It has simple steps that can be customized for sting allergies. You can use it for children with other allergies, too. Epinephrine \t Children who are severely allergic should be given epinephrine right away after any sting.  This is important even if the child has mild symptoms. After injecting epinephrine, call 911 and ask for an      ambulance  with epinephrine. You might need to give the child a second dose of epinephrine after five minutes if symptoms get worse, continue or do not get better. Symptoms of an Insect Sting Allergic Reaction  Shortness of breath Wheezing Coughing Pale skin Weak pulse Fainting Tight throat Trouble breathing Swelling of the lips or tongue that affects breathing Hives Confusion Symptoms in Nonallergic Children Nonallergic children might have symptoms that disappear soon after the sting or last a few hours to days. Sometimes, symptoms disappear and return. Swelling can increase for the next 48 hours. The area might be red for up to three days and swollen for up to a week. Mild reactions also include sneezing, an itchy nose and mouth, a few hives or a stomachache. Removal of the Stinger If a bee stung your child, remove the stinger as soon as possible. The stinger continues to release venom, which causes itching and pain. To find the stinger, look for a black dot in the center of the sting area. Scrape it out with a credit card or try peeling it off with a piece of sticky tape. If part of the stinger stays under the skin, it's OK to leave it alone, the AAP says. Pain Relief for Insect Stings The AAP suggests rubbing meat tenderizer, an aluminum-based deodorant or a baking soda paste on the sting. This neutralizes the venom and helps with pain and swelling. If the pain continues, use a cold pack or ice cube. Sometimes, over-the-counter steroid cream (e.g., 1% hydrocortisone) and antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine) help. If symptoms do not go away on their own or your child was stung multiple times, check with your child's pediatrician.

        "content": "Lyme disease is an important public health problem in some areas of the United States. Since its discovery in Lyme, CT, in 1975, thousands of cases of the disease have been reported across the United States and around the world. By knowing more about the disease and how to prevent it, you can help keep your family safe from the effects of Lyme disease.\t What is Lyme disease?\t Lyme disease is an infection caused by a bacteria called a spirochete. The disease is spread to humans by the bites of deer ticks infected with this bacteria. Deer ticks are tiny black-brown creatures. They live in forests or grassy, wooded, marshy areas near rivers, lakes, or oceans. Many people who have been infected with Lyme disease were bitten by deer ticks while hiking or camping, during other outdoor activities, or even while spending time in their own backyards, from the late spring to early fall.\t Where is Lyme disease most common?\t Deer ticks that are infected with Lyme disease live in areas that have very low and high seasonal temperatures and high humidity. In the United States, almost all cases of Lyme disease occur in the following regions:\t Northeast  (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont)\t North central states  (Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin)\t West Coast (California)\t  \t How will I know if my child has Lyme disease?\t The first and most obvious symptom of Lyme disease is a localized rash that begins as a pink or red circle that expands over time and may become several inches or larger. It may appear from 3 to 30 days after the bite occurred. Some people may have a single circle, while others may have many. Most people who develop the rash won't feel anything, but for others the rash may hurt, itch, burn, or feel warm to the touch. The rash most commonly appears on the head, neck, groin, thighs, trunk, and armpits.\t A rash may occur without any other symptoms or may include\t Headache\t Chills\t Fever\t Fatigue\t Swollen glands , usually in the neck or groin\t Aches and pains in the muscles or joints\t  \t If your child develops the rash with or without any of these symptoms, call your pediatrician.\t How serious is Lyme disease?\t For most people, Lyme disease can be easily recognized and treated. If left untreated, Lyme disease can get worse. Occasionally, patients can develop infection of the nervous system ( meningitis ) or facial muscle problems (facial nerve palsy). Late stage symptoms, occurring 1 or more months after the tick bite, are swelling of one or more joints.\t How is Lyme disease treated?\t Lyme disease is treated with  antibiotics  (usually penicillin, a cephalosporin, or a tetracycline) prescribed by your pediatrician. The antibiotics are usually taken by mouth, but also can be given intravenously (directly into the bloodstream through a vein) in more severe cases. Both early and late stages of the disease can be treated with antibiotics.\t How can I prevent Lyme disease?\t If you live or work in a region where Lyme disease is a problem, or if you visit such an area, the following are ways to protect your family from the ticks that carry the disease:\t Avoid places where ticks live.  Whenever possible, avoid shaded, moist areas likely to be infested with ticks.\t Cover arms and legs.  Have your child wear a long-sleeved shirt and tuck his pants into his socks.\t Wear a hat  to help keep ticks away from the scalp. Keep long hair pulled back.\t Wear light-colored clothing  to make it easier to spot ticks.\t Wear enclosed shoes or boots.  Avoid wearing sandals in an area where ticks may live.\t Use  insect repellent .  Products with  DEET  are effective against ticks and can be used on the skin. However, large amounts of DEET can be harmful to your child if it is absorbed through the skin. Look for products that contain no more than 30% DEET. Wash the DEET off with soap and water when your child returns indoors. Products with  permethrin  can be used on clothing, but  cannot  be applied to the skin.\t Stay on cleared trails whenever possible.  Avoid wandering from a trail or brushing against overhanging branches or shrubs.\t After coming indoors, check for ticks.  This will only take a couple minutes. Ticks often hide behind the ears or along the hairline. It usually takes more than 48 hours for a person to become infected with the bacteria, so removing any ticks soon after they have attached themselves is very effective for reducing the chances of becoming infected.\t  \t Keep in mind, ticks can be found right in your own backyard, depending on where you live. Keeping your yard clear of leaves, brush, and tall grass may reduce the number of ticks. Ask a licensed professional pest control expert about other steps you can take to reduce ticks in your yard.\t Ticks and how to remove them\t Ticks do not fly, jump, or drop from trees. They hide in long grass and small trees, bushes, or shrubs waiting for an animal or person to brush by. Then they attach themselves to the animal or person's skin. When a tick is found on a person or pet, try to remove as much of it as possible using the following steps:\t Grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible with fine-tipped tweezers. Be careful not to squeeze the tick's body.\t Slowly pull the tick away from the skin.\t After the tick is out, clean the bitten area with rubbing alcohol or other first aid ointment.\t Remember\t If you live in or plan to visit an area where Lyme disease has become a problem, it's important to take steps to avoid being bitten by deer ticks. If you have any questions about the disease, talk with your pediatrician.",

Psittacosis, or ornithosis, is a respiratory tract infection caused by the  Chlamydia  (or Chlamydophila) psittaci organism.\t The sources of psittacosis include parakeets, parrots, macaws, and cockatiels, especially those that may have been smuggled into the country. Pigeons and turkeys are other sources of the disease. In most cases, this disease is spread to humans when they breathe in airborne dust particles from dried bird feces. Birds do not have to be sick to transmit the disease.\t Transmission from person to person is very uncommon. Fortunately, this infection occurs rarely in children.

        "content": "Bacterial organisms from the Pasteurella species live in the mouths of most cats, as well as a significant number of dogs and other animals. If your child is  bitten or scratched by an animal  that carries Pasteurella organisms such as Pasteurella multocida, these bacteria can enter the body through the break in the skin. They most often cause a potentially serious infection of the skin called cellulitis. On occasion, these bacteria can be spread to humans from an animal’s saliva or nose mucus.\t Signs and Symptoms\t Symptoms of cellulitis usually begin after a very short incubation period, typically within 24 hours after your child has been bitten or scratched. He may develop swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness of the skin, sometimes with discharge of pus. In some children, lymph nodes in the area of the infected skin may become enlarged and chills and fever can occur. Complications may be present in some children, including an infection of the joints ( arthritis ), bones (osteomyelitis), and tendons (tenosynovitis). Less frequently, youngsters may have  pneumonia ,  urinary tract infections ,  meningitis , blood infections (septicemia), or  eye infections .\t What You Can Do\t If your child is bitten or scratched by an animal, wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water.\t When To Call Your Pediatrician\t If your child is bitten or scratched by a pet, wild animal, or any animal unknown to you, call your pediatrician for advice after promptly washing the wound. Also contact your doctor if you notice that an area of your child’s skin has become red, warm, and tender.\t How Is the Diagnosis Made?\t Your pediatrician will examine the area of your child’s skin that has been bitten or scratched. The doctor can order tests such as cultures and smears of the drainage from the wound to help identify the infectious organism.\t Treatment\t Your pediatrician will prescribe antibacterial treatment as soon as cellulitis is found. In most cases, children are treated with oral amoxicillin clavulanate because the exact cause of the cellulitis may not be known. If a culture shows the infection is caused by Pasteurella, oral penicillin can be used. Most infections require a 7- to 10-day dose of antibacterials, occasionally longer. Your pediatrician also may drain and clean the wound. If your child is very ill, the infection involves the hands, or it is spreading rapidly, your pediatrician will suggest hospital admission and use of intravenous antibacterials. Intravenous antibacterials are used for infections involving the blood, bone, joints, and brain.\t Following an animal bite, especially one involving the hands, your doctor may prescribe a preventive antibacterial medicine to stop an infection from occurring. The pediatrician will make sure that your child has been protected with tetanus vaccine and the doctor will decide if there is any risk for rabies.\t What Is the Prognosis?\t When appropriately treated with antibacterials, Pasteurella-related cellulitis usually clears up in about a week. Make sure your child takes the complete course of antibacterials, even if symptoms go away before all the pills are gone.\t Prevention\t Pets should not be allowed to lick very young  infants .\t Teach your child not to approach or touch unfamiliar pets or wild animals and never disturb an animal that is eating.",

        "content": "Children are the victims of about 60% of all  dog bites  in the United States. Fortunately, a relatively small number of these bites spread the very serious rabies infection. Rabies is a rare disease in the United States, with 1 to 2 deaths reported each year. Rabies is caused by a virus that is present in animals infected with it. The virus can spread to humans through direct contact with the saliva of an infected animal, usually from bites or scratches. The greatest risk comes from wild animals, especially bats, but also raccoons, skunks, foxes and coyotes. Domestic pets such as dogs and cats are usually immunized against rabies.  Signs & symptoms of rabies When the rabies virus enters the body, it can move along the nerve pathways to the brain. It causes serious symptoms beginning with pain, tingling, and numbness at the site of the bite or scratch. It can then progress rapidly to other symptoms including: Anxiety, restlessness and aggressiveness Swallowing difficulties, particularly water (hydrophobia) Muscle spasms Drooling Seizures Paralysis Coma and death   How long does it take to show signs of rabies in people? The incubation period for rabies in humans may last weeks to months. However, it can be shorter with bites on the face. It can also be much longer in some cases of bites on the feet or legs (extending more than a year sometimes).  What to do if your child is bitten by an animal If your child has been bitten by an animal, thoroughly flush the wound with water and wash it with soap and water. If possible, it is important that the animal be captured so a veterinarian can check if it has a rabies infection. Unless proper equipment is available, though, don't attempt to capture a possibly rabid animal. Captured animals are killed and their brains are examined for rabies immediately. Pets who appear well and have been immunized can be watched for symptoms of the disease. This observation period should extend for 10 days. If the animal develops symptoms, it must be killed and the brain examined. When to call your pediatrician Any time that your child is bitten by an animal, contact your pediatrician. All animal bites should be reported to health officials who will be able to tell you whether the bite presents a risk of rabies.  Any bite by a wild animal should be considered a risk for rabies until proven otherwise.  If the animal is a domestic and healthy pet, your pediatrician may ask that the animal be observed, under the supervision of a veterinarian. The pediatrician will start the shots only if the animal shows signs of rabies. If a bat is found in a room where your child has been sleeping or playing, report it immediately to your pediatrician, even if you don't find a bite mark. Your child should start preventive treatment for rabies unless the bat can be tested for rabies and is negative. How is rabies diagnosed? Your pediatrician will examine your child. If rabies is suspected, several tests will be done on saliva, blood, skin, and spinal fluid to look for evidence of the virus.  Treatment & prognosis for rabies There is no specific treatment for rabies once the infection develops in a child. Rabies infection is nearly always fatal once symptoms start; there have been very few survivors. Death is usually caused by respiratory or heart failure within days after the appearance of symptoms.  However, prompt and proper treatment of bites can prevent or control the infection before it involves the brain and produces serious symptoms. Therefore, prevention is extremely important. How to prevent rabies infection Rabies vaccine  Following a bite, if your pediatrician determines that the animal has a high risk of having rabies and is not available to be tested or observed, they will immunize your child right away with rabies immune globulin and the first of 4 doses of rabies vaccine. The rabies immune globulin, disease-battling antibodies, is injected into the skin around the bite. The rabies vaccine will be injected into the arm or thigh, depending on the age of your child.  Once your child receives the vaccine, it will stimulate their body to make its own antibodies against rabies infection. Your child will be given 3 more doses of rabies vaccine on days 3, 7 and 14 after the bite. What else can families do to protect against rabies? Stray or wild animals Teach your child to avoid contact with any stray or wild animals.   Your child should not tease or bother an animal. Also, they should not examine or play with a dead animal that they may find. You can reduce the presence of wild animals in the area of your home by tightly closing garbage can lids. Chimney covers can prevent bats from getting into the home. Pets Make sure your own family pet receives animal rabies shots according to your veterinarian's recommendations.

On occasion, the disease can also be spread by ingestion of contaminated food or milk products (Haverhill fever). Most cases in the United States are caused by bacteria called  Streptobacillus moniliformis.  Another form of rat-bite fever, caused by  Spirillum minus,  is almost always caused by a rat bite. It cannot be caught from food or milk and is rarely seen in the United States. Person-to-person transmission does not occur.

        "content": "Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a bacterial disease spread through the bite of an infected tick. It was first discovered in the western mountains of the United States. That's how the disease got its name. But it occurs throughout the country—especially in mid-Atlantic and southern states. The disease can occur in children of any age. Those who spend time outdoors or who have pets that may carry infected ticks, are at higher risk from Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Infections can occur at any time of year, but in most areas, cases happen in May through August, or whenever the weather is warm. Outbreak of Rocky Mountain spotted fever  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning of an    outbreak  of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in people who have traveled to or live in Tecate, Mexico, since July 2023. At least five people were hospitalized and three people died. Four of the infections were in people under age 18 years. If you or a family member has traveled to Tecate or another city in northern Mexico and develop symptoms during travel or within 2 weeks of returning home, seek medical attention. Learn more about the outbreak    here . How does Rocky Mountain spotted fever spread? Children usually get Rocky Mountain spotted fever from the bite of a tick that is infected with bacteria called    Rickettsia rickettsii . Ticks that most commonly spread this bacteria include the    American dog tick ,    Rocky Mountain wood tick  and the    brown dog tick . Signs and symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever Symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever usually appear about a week after the tick bite, but it can range from 2 days to 2 weeks. \t Flu-like symptoms  are common, including    fever , muscle pain,    headaches ,    vomiting , nausea, and loss of appetite.\t Rash  usually develops by the sixth day of the illness. A Rocky Mountain spotted fever  rash  tends to appear first on a child's wrists and ankles, but within hours it can spread to the torso. It also may spread to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Often, it starts out as flat red splotches or pinpoint dots but may change and become bumpy or purplish.\t Other symptoms  can include joint pain, stomach pain and diarrhea. In severe cases, blood pressure can drop and cause the child to act confused. As the infection spreads, many organs, including the brain, may be affected. When to call your pediatrician If your child was bitten by a tick and develops any of these symptoms, contact your pediatrician right away. The doctor will examine your child and run tests to confirm the diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. How is Rocky Mountain spotted fever treated? If your pediatrician suspects your child has Rocky Mountain spotted fever, they will prescribe an antibiotic called doxycycline. Treatment with Rocky Mountain spotted fever medication usually continues for 7 to 10 days or until the child's fever has been gone for at least 3 days. It is important that your child takes all of the medicine that is prescribed to get rid of the infection. With early treatment, nearly all children make a full recovery. In rare cases, Rocky Mountain spotted fever can cause serious illness or even be deadly. If the infection is not treated, it can cause damage to blood vessels, nerves and organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. Not receiving proper Rocky Mountain spotted fever treatment can cause other serious problems including hearing or vision loss, and    gangrene  in the fingers and toes that could lead to amputation. How to prevent Rocky Mountain spotted fever There is no vaccine to prevent RMSF. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid tick bites. Ticks live in grass, scrub vegetation and wooded areas and on animals. If you plan to be outdoors, wear a long-sleeved shirt, pants and hat, ideally in lighter colors that make ticks easier to spot. Avoid wearing sandals.  Here are more tips to protect your family from ticks. \t Use insect repellent  products that have been registered by the Environmental Protection Agency, and always follow directions. DEET is considered the best defense against ticks. Learn more about DEET and other insect repellents for babies and children here.\t Keep ticks off pets.  Ticks can be brought into the house on your    pets . Use a flea and tick preventive product on your pets and check their fur for ticks or signs of tick bites.\t Wash up.  Wash the insect repellent off with soap and water when your child comes inside. Taking a bath or shower can also help remove loose ticks, which can take 4 to 6 hours to firmly attach to skin.\t Do tick checks.  Check for ticks daily, especially under the arms, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, behind the knees, between the legs, around the waist, and on the hairline and scalp.\t Remove ticks.  If you find a tick on your child's skin, the sooner it comes off the less likely it will spread infection it may carry. But it's important to    remove it  carefully. Remember Rocky Mountain spotted fever is relatively rare but can be serious if not treated early. Especially if you live in a tick-infested area, take steps to prevent it, know the symptoms. Rocky Mountain spotted fever can develop in people who do not know they have been bitten by a tick. Call your pediatrician right away with any concerns.

        "content": "A large roundworm, Ascaris lumbricoides is the cause of a parasitic infection of the small intestines called ascariasis. Humans are the preferred hosts for this parasite. Children become infected with this disease more often than adults. The illness often develops after a child puts his hands in his mouth after playing in soil contaminated by feces containing the roundworm eggs. Eating unwashed fruit or vegetables that were grown in contaminated soil can also cause ascariasis. Although the infection can occur in any part of the world, it is more common in developing countries with poor sanitation and areas where human feces are used as fertilizer. \t The entire life cycle for this parasite occurs within humans. The adult worm in the bowels of a child lays thousands of eggs a day, which then pass into the stools. In areas with poor sanitation or where human feces are used as fertilizer, the eggs will mature for 2 to 3 weeks in the soil and become infectious on the surface of unwashed fruits or vegetables. If a child plays in the contaminated soil, he can get the eggs directly onto his fingers and put his fingers into his mouth, or a person could eat the parasite’s eggs that may end up on the surface of unwashed vegetables. After the eggs hatch in the bowel, the larvae burrow through the bowel wall and into the bloodstream. The blood carries the larvae to the lung, where the parasites can enter the breathing sacs. The larvae then crawl up the breathing tubes and into the throat, where they are swallowed. Once they are back in the gut, the larvae mature to adult worms. \t Signs and Symptoms \t Most children with A lumbricoides infections do not have any signs and symptoms. Sometimes youngsters have stomach cramps and, in the more serious cases, even intestinal obstruction that could lead to vomiting. Worms that travel into the bile ducts can cause blockage and infection of the liver, pancreas, or both. When the roundworm’s larvae migrate through the lungs, they can cause an allergic lung inflammation (pneumonitis) along with fever, cough, and wheezing. Sometimes, the worms are seen coming out of the anus, mouth, or nose. \t When to Call Your Pediatrician \t Contact your pediatrician if your child has any of the symptoms or signs described here, especially if they continue to get worse. Let your doctor know if your child has traveled to parts of the world where parasitic infections are common (ie, areas of poor sanitation, the tropics). \t How Is the Diagnosis Made? \t Most often, this infection is diagnosed by seeing a worm or worms in the diaper or toilet bowl or detecting eggs in a sample of your child’s stool. The eggs are microscopic in size, while the worms are several inches in length and have an appearance similar to an earthworm. \t Treatment \t To treat A lumbricoides infections, your pediatrician may prescribe a single dose of medicine called albendazole or 3 days of pyrantel or mebendazole. These treatments should be given whether the infection causes symptoms. \t Surgery is occasionally needed to relieve an intestinal or bile duct blockage. \t What Is the Prognosis? \t With proper treatment, children fully recover from ascariasis. \t Prevention \t Reinfection is common. Keep your child away from soil that could be contaminated with human feces. Make sure you wash vegetables and fruits prior to eating.",

        "content": "​Infections from ticks are on the rise in the United States. But while many parents know about      Lyme Disease , fewer may be aware of other illnesses children can get from ticks. Fever, headache and other flu-like symptoms a week or two after being bitten by a tick, for example, could be symptoms of      human ehrlichiosis infection . How is it Spread? Human ehrlichioses infections are caused by at least 3 different types of bacteria that are spread through bites of infected ticks— Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Ehrlichia ewingii,  and      Anaplasma spp.  \t   Lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum),  named for the single white dot on their backs, are the primary way humans are affected with ehrlichioses. In addition, lone star ticks are aggressive human biters—the most common tick reported to bite humans in the southeastern and southcentral United States. However, there have been reports of long star ticks in states as far north as Minnesota and New Hampshire. \t Deer ticks  ( Ixodes scapularis ) and      dog ticks  ( Dermacentor variabilis ) also can be infected with and spread the bacteria causing human ehrlichioses. Signs and Symptoms:  Ehrlichiosis infections have signs and symptoms similar to influenza (the flu), including:  Fever  Headache  Chills  Muscle and joint aches and pains  Generally feeling sick and fatigued (malaise)  Poor appetite Nausea and vomiting In some cases, the child may also develop a rash, cough or confusion. These symptoms typically begin 5 to 10 days after the tick bite. It is important to remember that tick bites often go unnoticed. Many people with tick-borne infections do not realize that a tick has bitten them. What Parents Can Do:\t Call the pediatrician . Children, or their parents, may not notice if they've been bitten by a tick.  Call your pediatrician right away if your child has these symptoms—especially if the family recently spent time in nature areas. Your child may need lab tests and may receive a prescription antibacterial medication, usually doxycycline, if it turns out he or she has a human ehrlichiosis infection. Most children with ehrlichioses who are treated will recover completely within 1 to 2 weeks.\t Prevent exposure.  Limit your child's exposure to ticks and bacteria they may carry as much as possible. Steps that can help include: \t Stick to the beaten path.  Try to stay on the trail in wooded areas where ticks are known to be a problem. Avoid playing in tall grassy areas or those with a lot of leaves on the ground, habitats that ticks also love.\t Backyard basics.  Keep lawns where children play mowed and raked. Try to set up play equipment, such as swing sets, in sunny, dry areas away from wooded edges of yards.\t Cover up.  Dress your child in a hat and long-sleeved shirt and long pants that cover most of the body. Tuck pant legs into his or her socks.\t Use insect repellent.  Apply an EPA-registered               insect repellant  to exposed skin in a ventilated area. For example, repellents containing 20-30% DEET are safe and effective when used as directed for children. Products containing plant-based picaridin can also be used on skin and can help keep ticks off. Reapply every 6 hours or according to label instructions. Permethrin products can be used to treat clothing and gear, but should not be applied to skin. \t Don't forget pets.  Treat pets with tick repellents as advised by your veterinarian. \t Wash off . Bathing or showering after coming inside makes it easier to spot ticks that may be crawling or attached to the skin. Be sure to check less visible spots such as folds of skin, behind the ears, and the scalp.\t Remove ticks.  Gently            remove any ticks  you see as soon as possible to minimize exposure to the bacteria they may carry. Using tweezers, pull straight out without twisting. After the tick is removed wash the area with soap and water.\t Use the dryer.  To help kill ticks, put clothing right into the dryer, if possible, on high heat for at least 10 minutes. ​​If you have any questions about tick-related illness, talk with your pediatrician.

Fortunately, only a few species can cause significant poisonings. Death rarely occurs. However, bites from the black widow and brown recluse spiders have been known to cause death. \t Black Widow Spider\t The body of the female black widow is shaped like an hourglass. She is a dark color with red or yellow on the abdomen. Black widow spiders are found in all 48 contiguous states. Only the female is dangerous. The male is too small to bite through human skin.\t The bite itself often goes unno¬ticed or may be felt as a pin¬prick. Black widow spider venom is very potent. It attacks the muscles in humans. Symptoms are often severe muscle pain and cramping. \t Brown Recluse Spider \t The brown recluse spider is also known as the fiddle-back or violin spider. A violin-shaped marking on the back helps to identify it. Both the male and female are dangerous. \t It is rare to see the brown recluse spider when it bites because the bite is painless. Most bites happen while the person is sleeping. Reactions to a bite from a brown recluse vary. They range from mild irritation at the bite site to a potentially fatal poisoning.\t What to Look For:  \t Tiny fang marks \t Pain \t Pain begins as a dull ache at the bite site \t Pain spreads to the surrounding muscles \t Pain moves to the abdomen, back, chest, and legs \t Blister at the bite site \t Mild swelling and a blue-gray mark at the bite surrounded by lightening of skin color \t Progressive soft tissue damage; the skin becomes dark blue and then black (necrotic)\t First Aid Care for Spider Bites\t If you suspect that your child has been bitten by a brown recluse or black widow spider, call EMS. Wash the bite area with soap and rinse with water.\t Cover the area with a cloth and apply ice or a cold pack. This will help relieve pain and delay the effects of the venom.

        "content": "Tapeworms can cause intestinal infections. When they do, any of a number of tapeworm species may be involved. These may include Taenia saginata (beef tapeworms), Taenia solium (from pork), or Diphyllobothrium latum (from fish). Tapeworms require human hosts to live out their life cycles. They affect people through contact with contaminated human feces found in soil, fresh water, or food. Children can develop these diseases by eating raw or undercooked meat from animals or fish that are infected with tapeworms. Contaminated food contains cysts of the parasite. Your child may have a tapeworm infection and have no symptoms. \t When a child eats tapeworm cysts in undercooked beef, pork, or fish, the cyst survives the stomach acids and releases the larvae. The parasite grows within the child’s bowel to become an adult tapeworm. The adult tapeworm has up to 1,000 segments called proglottids, each of which contain 30,000 to 100,000 eggs. A proglottid separates from the adult and travels out of the intestines with the stool. The segment is about 0.5 to 1 inch in length and can sometimes be seen moving in the stool or on the anus. If a child or adult has an adult tapeworm, they will pass segments filled with eggs in their stools. \t These eggs are then released onto soil and eaten by cattle or pigs, in which they hatch, enter the bloodstream, and form cysts in the meat, completing the parasitic life cycle. These eggs can also get onto the hands of humans and then into foods that they are preparing. The eggs of the fish tapeworm do not affect humans. These eggs need a different host called a copepod, which is a small fresh-water shrimplike animal. The copepod is eaten by a fish, which then becomes contaminated with the tapeworm, thus completing the life cycle. The eggs of the beef tapeworm also do not affect people. However, when a person eats an egg from pork tapeworms, the egg hatches in the bowel and the larva emerges. The larva then burrows through the wall of the bowel to enter the bloodstream. Because the larva is not in a pig (the preferred host of a pork tapeworm), it cannot go through its normal life cycle. Thus, in its human host, the larva gets stuck in tissues such as the muscles, liver, and brain. Within the tissue, the larva forms a cyst. Cysts within the brain can cause seizures. \t When adult tapeworms cause human illness, doctors use the name taeniasis to describe the infection. In contrast, when pork tapeworm larvae lead to illness, it is called cysticercosis. \t Tapeworm infections tend to be more common in parts of the world with poor sanitation systems or where beef, pork, and fish are eaten raw or poorly cooked. Some tapeworms can grow up to 30 feet and live as long as 25 years! \t Signs and Symptoms \t Many tapeworm infections are symptom free. When symptoms are present, they often include \t Nausea \t Diarrhea \t Stomach pain \t Fish tapeworm competes with its human host for vitamin B12 in the intestine and, in prolonged cases, can cause pernicious anemia. \t Children who ingest pork tapeworm eggs can develop tapeworm cysts (cysticercosis) within their internal organs. If these cysts occur in the brain, they can cause serious symptoms such as seizures, behavioral disturbances, and even death. \t When to Call Your Pediatrician \t Contact your pediatrician if you notice something moving in your child’s stool that could be a worm segment, your youngster has prolonged stomach pain, or any of the other symptoms appear without another, more obvious cause. If you think your child might have been exposed to tapeworms within the past 2 to 3 months, let your pediatrician know. Make sure your doctor is aware if your child has traveled recently to a developing country. \t How Is the Diagnosis Made? \t To diagnose a tapeworm infection, your pediatrician will send your child’s stool sample for tests to detect eggs or worm segments of the suspected tapeworm. Children with cysticercosis usually do not have adult tapeworms. Therefore, eggs are not usually found in the stool. Blood tests can be done to look for antibodies to the tapeworm. In patients with seizures, imaging of the brain with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed to look for cysts or other abnormalities. \t Treatment \t Your pediatrician may prescribe oral drugs such as praziquantel or, as an alternative, niclosamide to treat a tapeworm infestation. These medicines are typically given in a single dose. \t Other antiparasitic drugs, including albendazole and praziquantel, are available specifically for treating cysticercosis. Anticonvulsant medications should be used to control seizures if they occur. \t What Is the Prognosis? \t Drug treatment for tapeworms is very effective and can completely kill the parasite. Treatment for the cysts will get rid of them, but the area of the brain may remain abnormal and seizures may continue. \t Prevention \t To reduce your child’s risk of developing tapeworm infections, do not allow him to eat raw or undercooked fish, beef, or pork. Be sure he always practices good hygiene, including regular hand washing, especially after using the bathroom. To avoid cysticercosis, be sure that all food handlers wash their hands. Proper sanitation is the key to the elimination of tapeworm infestation worldwide.",

        "content": "Many parents assume that children are most likely to be bitten by strange or wild animals, but in fact most bites are inflicted by animals the child knows, including the family pet. Although the injury often is minor, biting does at times cause serious wounds, facial damage, and emotional problems. If your child is bleeding from an animal bite, apply firm continuous pressure to the area for five minutes or until the blood flow stops. Then wash the wound gently with soap and water, and consult your pediatrician.  If the wound is very large, or if you cannot stop the bleeding, continue to apply pressure and call your pediatrician to find out where to take your child for treatment. If the wound is so large that the edges won’t come together, it probably will need to be sutured (stitched). Although this will help reduce scarring, in an animal bite, it increases the chance of infection, so your doctor may prescribe preventive antibiotics.  Contact your pediatrician whenever your child receives an animal bite that breaks the skin, no matter how minor the injury appears. The doctor will need to check whether your child has been adequately immunized against tetanus or might require protection against rabies. Both of these diseases can be spread by animal bites.  Like any other wound, a bite can become infected. Notify your pediatrician immediately if you see any of the following signs of infection: Pus or drainage coming from the bite The area immediately around the bite becoming swollen and tender (It normally will be red for two or three days, but this in itself is not cause for alarm.) Red streaks that appear to spread out from the bite Swollen glands above the bite  Your pediatrician may recommend antibiotic therapy for a child who has: Moderate or severe bite wounds Puncture wounds, especially if the bone, tendon, or joint has been penetrated Facial bites Hand and foot bites Genital area bites  Your pediatrician may recommend a follow-up visit to inspect any wound for signs of infection within forty-eight hours.",

        "content": "Sometimes called rabbit fever, tularemia is caused by the  Francisella tularensis  bacteria. It is spread to humans through the bites of infected insects—most often, ticks, mosquitoes, and deerflies. It can also be passed to people by direct contact with infected animals, including rabbits, cats, hares, and muskrats. Your child can get tularemia by consuming contaminated food or water, eating inadequately cooked meat, or breathing in the bacteria. It cannot be transmitted from person to person.\t Symptoms generally begin after an incubation period of usually 3 to 5 days, but possibly as long as 21 days. \t According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are about 200 human cases of tularemia reported per year in the United States, mostly in rural regions. Most cases occur during the summer months, similar to tick season.\t Signs and Symptoms\t Tularemia can cause illnesses that vary depending on how the infection was spread. Most commonly, a painful ulcer develops in the skin at the site of the insect bite, with tender enlarged lymph glands in the groin or armpits. Sometimes the glands may enlarge with no apparent bite. \t Infection from food or water begins in the mouth with a severe sore throat, mouth sores, and enlargement of the neck lymph glands. With this form of the illness, your child may develop vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.\t Illness from inhalation of the bacteria mainly results in fever, chills, muscle aches, and a dry cough. When the infection enters through the eyes, it results in swollen and red eyes with tender lymph glands in front of the ears. In many cases, tularemia is seen as a combination of several of these symptoms.\t When to Call Your Pediatrician\t Call your pediatrician immediately if your child develops an illness that could be a sign of tularemia, especially if he has a high fever, chills, a skin ulcer, or enlarged lymph glands. Prompt treatment is very important with this infection.\t How Is the Diagnosis Made?\t Your pediatrician will take samples of your child’s blood and have them tested in the laboratory for antibodies to tularemia. Sometimes the bacteria can be grown from the blood or infected sites.\t Treatment\t The doctor will treat your child with an antibiotic such as streptomycin or gentamicin. Treatment usually lasts for a 10-day period, although sometimes longer for more serious cases. Early treatment of the infection is important.\t What Is the Prognosis?\t When children are treated with the appropriate antibiotics, their infection will quickly clear up, although relapses occasionally occur. If the infection goes completely untreated, however, it can be life threatening in some cases.\t Prevention\t You can protect your child from the bites that cause tularemia by making sure he wears protective clothing.  Also, inspect your child frequently for ticks and remove any that may have attached themselves to his skin or scalp. The use of insect repellents, particularly those that contain the chemical DEET, is also recommended. Use gloves, masks, and goggles when skinning or dressing wild animals.\t Other preventive measures include:\t \t  Instruct your child not to handle sick or dead animals.\t   Make sure all meat is cooked thoroughly before feeding it to your youngster.\t   Ensure that drinking water comes from an uncontaminated source.\t A vaccine is not available to protect against tularemia, although interest in vaccine development has been growing since concerns have been raised about the use of the  F tularensis  bacteria as a bioterrorist weapon. This organism could be spread through an airborne route, at which point it could be breathed in and would need to be treated quickly with antibiotics.",

        "content": "Those beautiful summer and early fall days that beckon us outdoors also often expose us to a lot of insects. And that includes stinging insects. Those stings often cause us brief moments of pain. But for some people, a sting can result in a serious, even deadly allergic reaction — including severe lung and breathing problems. That can be especially dangerous for a child who has asthma or other breathing challenges.  “There are between 50 and 100 deaths a year from anaphylaxis as a result of stinging insects,” says John Kelso, M.D. FAAP, of the division of Allergies, Asthma and Immunology at San Diego’s Scripps Clinic. While this figure is low compared to the thousands of anaphylaxis deaths from food and drug allergies each year, many of the sting-related deaths could be prevented.  Allergies and Asthma, Insects and Immunity  Bees, wasps, hornets, yellow jackets, and imported fire ants are the prime villains in such cases. But it’s the nature of the victim’s immune system and sensitivity to the insect’s venom that triggers the reaction.  In severe reactions, the child’s allergic immune response to the sting results in the air passages shrinking, making breathing difficult or impossible. Children experiencing anaphylaxis should receive emergency medical treatment immediately. Among the most common emergency treatments is epinephrine (eh-pih-NEH-frin) — another word for adrenalin — which helps open the airways by reducing the tightening of the muscle embedded in the airway.  “The vast majority of people who are stung won’t have a serious reaction at all,” Kelso says, “much less an anaphylactic reaction. This is even true of those who have asthma or other lung diseases. And any patient experiencing anaphylaxis can display the symptoms of asthma, whether they actually have asthma or not.”  However, if the person stung is allergic and has asthma or other lung disease, the reaction is potentially more dangerous. (See “Stinging Insects and Asthma” below.) Is Your Child at Risk?  How do you know if you or your children are allergic to insect stings? “A prior exposure to what causes the reaction (the allergen) is necessary in order to be allergic,” Kelso says. “You have to have been stung and had some kind of reaction.” For patients whose insect-sting allergy has been established, Kelso recommends several courses of action.  “Venom immunotherapy is one approach to dealing with the allergy,” Kelso notes. Patients who receive this treatment are injected with small doses of the allergen — bee venom, for instance — which gradually strengthen their immune system’s resistance to the venom’s effects. Many professional beekeepers, for example, have been stung so frequently that their immune systems barely react to the venom.  “It’s also a good idea for people allergic to insect stings to carry a self-injectable dose of epinephrine in order to be prepared for an anaphylactic emergency,” Kelso says. Parents of allergic children should make sure that teachers and school staff members, camp counselors, coaches, and other activity supervisors are aware of the child’s allergy. Facilities should be equipped with epinephrine and other needed emergency treatments.  The best defense against potentially dangerous insect stings is, of course, not to get stung. “Avoidance is the best treatment for all allergic diseases,” Kelso says. He recommends that people remain alert when outdoors for anthills, bee swarms and nests, as well as areas that attract large populations of mosquitoes and other flying insects.  “If you’re allergic, be careful about outdoor strolls and gatherings, such as picnics,” he adds. “Don’t pick up empty soda cans or other trash that might attract insects. Don’t go barefoot. Don’t wear flowery scents. Try to look and smell as little like a flower as possible.”  Stinging Insects and Asthma  The vast majority of asthma patients aren’t allergic to insect stings and won’t experience a severe anaphylactic reaction if stung, notes Dr. John Kelso of Scripps Clinic’s division of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology in San Diego.  But what if you do have both asthma and an allergy to insect venom?  “If you superimpose an anaphylactic event on top of asthma,” Kelso says, “your chances of dying are increased.”  As many as two-thirds of the 50 to 100 annual anaphylaxis deaths from stinging insects are in patients who have both asthma and an allergy to stings. Similarly high asthma-patient figures are noted in the far higher number of anaphylactic deaths from non-insect causes, such as allergies to peanuts, penicillin, and other food and drug allergies.  As with non-asthma patients who are allergic to stinging insects, asthma patients need to be prepared and vigilant in situations that could expose them to insect stings. Asthma sufferers should take extra precautions during insect season. It’s wise to carry an injectable dose of epinephrine, to manage asthma as effectively as possible, and to avoid locations and events likely to attract stinging insects.  In other words, you don’t necessarily have to avoid the outdoors. But you should do everything possible to avoid exposing yourself to the stinging residents you may find there.

        "content": "Nocturnal enuresis, defined as nighttime    bedwetting  beyond age 5, affects many school-age children and even some teens. It's not a serious health problem, and children usually outgrow it. Still, bedwetting can be upsetting for children and parents. \t It's important to work with your child's doctors to find possible causes and solutions. Here are some frequently asked questions.  How common is bedwetting in school-age children and teens?  Occasional \"accidents\" are common among children who are toilet trained. Around 20% of children have some problems with bedwetting at age 5, and up to 10% still do at age 7. By the late teens, the estimated rate of bedwetting is between 1% and 3% of children. Nocturnal enuresis is 2 to 3 times more common in boys than girls. There are 2 types of nocturnal enuresis: \t Primary enuresis:  a child has never had bladder control at night and has always wet the bed. \t Secondary enuresis:  a child did have bladder control at night for a period of at least 6 months, but lost that control and now wets the bed again.  Primary enuresis is much more common. Secondary enuresis in older children or teens should be evaluated by a doctor. Bedwetting in this age group could be a sign of a urinary tract infection or other health problems, neurological issues (related to the brain), stress, or other issues. What are some causes of bedwetting? Although it is not completely understood why bedwetting occurs, it is thought to happen because of a delay in the development in at least one of the following three areas at nighttime: \t Bladder : less space in the bladder at night\t Kidney:  more urine is made at night\t Brain:  unable to wake up during sleep In babies and toddlers, links between the brain and the bladder have not fully formed; the bladder will just release urine whenever it feels full. As children get older, the connections between brain and bladder develop. This allows a child to control when the bladder empties. This control usually develops during the daytime first; it takes more time before it happens at night.  Other bedwetting risk factors: \t Genetics.  If one parent wet the bed after 5 years old, their children may have the same problem about 40% of the time. If both parents wet the bed as children, then each of their children would have about a 70% chance of having the same problem. \t Stress.  This is one of the most common reason for secondary enuresis. Children experience    stress  when moving to a new home or school, experiencing a parental divorce or losing a parent or other people they love, or going through another major life event. This stress can cause bedwetting; treating the stress can stop the bedwetting. \t Deep sleep.  A deep sleep pattern can be part of normal adolescent development, as can a poor sleep schedule and too few hours of sleep. This is all common during    puberty  and especially during a teen's high school years.   \t Obstructive sleep apnea/snoring.  In rare cases, bedwetting happens because a child has    obstructive sleep apnea  and    snores . Children with this condition have a partly blocked airway that can briefly stop their breathing when they sleep. This can change the chemical balance of the brain, which may trigger the bedwetting. \t Constipation.  The bladder and bowels sit very near each other in the body. A backed up bowel (constipation) can push on the bladder and cause the child to lose bladder control. Treating the    constipation  is often the first step to treating the bedwetting in these cases. If your child is having pain or straining with bowel movements, this could be contributing to bedwetting. \t Bladder or \t   kidney disease . This may be the case if a child has both daytime and nighttime bladder control problems and other urinary symptoms such as pain when peeing or the need to pee frequently.\t Neurologic disease.  Sometimes a spinal cord problem that develops with growth or that is present early in childhood can cause bedwetting. If your child has other symptoms like numbness, tingling, or pain in the legs, a spinal issue may be considered. However, this is a very rare cause of bedwetting. \t Other \t medical conditions and/or medications . In rare cases, other medical conditions like    diabetes  cause enuresis in children.    Some studies  suggest that children with    attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder  are more likely to have enuresis, possibly because of differences in brain chemistry. Some medications can also increase the chances of bedwetting.  The emotional impact of bedwetting\t Bedwetting may have an emotional impact on both children and their families. Children may get embarrassed, feel anxious, or develop low self-esteem. This can affect their relationships, quality of life, and schoolwork.  Children with bedwetting may feel like they cannot go to sleepovers with their friends or overnight camps. Siblings may have to sleep in separate rooms or be woken up when the parent or bedwetting alarm wakes the affected child. Family members may have the extra work of cleaning the dirty sheets and clothes. \t   It is very important to remember that bedwetting is not your child's fault or under his or her control.  \t   Family members and friends should not shame or punish the child. \t Instead, focus on working with your doctor to figure out the cause and taking steps that can help. How is bedwetting evaluated?  Your child's doctor will first take a complete medical history and ask about any other urinary symptoms such as the urge to urinate a lot, the need to \"run to the bathroom\" a lot, or pain or burning while peeing. The doctor will also ask about sleep patterns, how often your child moves his or her bowels, and family health. The doctor will ask if either parent wet their bed at night as a child. Finally, the doctor may ask about stressful events in the child's life that could be adding to the problem. Your child will also receive a complete physical exam including a simple urine test (urinalysis). This test shows signs of a disease or an infection. In most children with enuresis, the results of this test come back completely normal. X-rays are usually not needed. Is there treatment for older children and teens who wet the bed?  Yes. However, treatment for bedwetting first depends on if it is caused by something like stress, which would need to be managed first. Overall, children who take an active part in their treatment have a better chance of decreasing or stopping the bedwetting. Bedwetting alarms\t Research  shows that about half of children who properly use enuretic (bedwetting) alarms will stay dry at night after a few weeks. These alarms buzz or vibrate when a child's underwear gets wet. Over time, the brain is trained to associate the feeling of needing to pee with the alarm going off, and getting up and going to the bathroom. This therapy requires active participation by an adult to make sure the child fully wakes up and goes to the bathroom when the alarm goes off. Medications There are only two  medications  that have been approved for bedwetting—imipramine and desmopressin. It is important to note that bedwetting usually returns once medications are stopped, unless the child has \"grown out of\" nocturnal enuresis.\t Imipramine  works well in some children with nocturnal enuresis. There is a chance of overdose on this medicine, so it is important for parents to strictly control how and when they give the medicine. An    EKG  is recommended before starting this medicine, although heart problems have not been reported with doses of imipramine used to treat bedwetting. Children with an abnormal EKG should not use this medicine.\t Desmopressin  (DDAVP) helps to reduce the amount of urine your body makes. It improves bedwetting in about 40% to 60% of children. DDAVP comes in both nasal spray and pill forms and is taken before bed. It is important to not drink any fluids after taking it to decrease the risk of electrolyte imbalance. An additional medication, oxybutynin, has been show to be helpful, especially in patients who do not respond to DDAVP alone and can be given in combination with it. Tips for parents whose children wet the bed\t Limit intake of food or drinks with caffeine and avoid salty snacks and \t \t  sugary drinks , especially during the evening. \t Encourage your child to go to the bathroom regularly during the day (every two to three hours) and just before going to bed. \t Wake your child only once during the night to urinate, if necessary. Waking your child more than once a night may disrupt his or her sleep pattern, which could lead to problems at school the next day.\t For sleepovers and overnight camps, consider sending your child with disposable underpants with boxer shorts over them. Talk with your child about asking the host parent or camp counselor to help them in private, if needed.  \t Will bedwetting stay with my child into adulthood?  Bedwetting almost always goes away on its own. Most children will grow out of it by the late teenage years or sooner. Secondary enuresis may go away when the cause is found. It is either treated, or it gets better on its own. If bedwetting has not stopped in the late teenage years, your child should be seen by a doctor. Remember Never wait to talk about bedwetting with your pediatrician to find a solution that works best for your child and your family.

        "content": "Urine leaves the bladder through a tube called the urethra, which in boys passes through the penis. Rarely, small membranes form across the urethra in boys early in pregnancy, and they can block the flow of urine out of the bladder. These membranes are called posterior urethral valves and can have life-threatening consequences by causing blockage of normal urine flow interfering with development of the kidneys. If there is abnormal kidney development, there can be abnormal development of the lungs.\t The severity of posterior urethral valves can vary widely. Most cases are diagnosed before birth with a screening ultrasound. This condition may be suspected in boys if there appears to be a decrease in the amount of amniotic fluid. Consulting a  pediatric urology specialist  is always advisable before the baby is born. \t In boys who are not diagnosed before birth with posterior urethral valve, sometimes the newborn exam may reveal that the baby’s bladder is distended and enlarged. Other warning signals include a continual dribbling of urine and a weak stream during urination. More commonly though, posterior urethral valve is diagnosed when the boy develops a urinary tract infection with fever and poor feeding. If you notice these symptoms, notify your pediatrician at once.\t Posterior urethral valves require immediate medical attention to prevent serious urinary tract infections or damage to the kidneys. If the blockage is severe, the urine can back up through the ureters (the tubes between the bladder and the kidneys), creating pressure that can damage the kidneys.\t Treatment\t If your child has a posterior urethral valve, your pediatrician may pass a small tube (catheter) into the bladder to relieve the obstruction temporarily and allow the urine to flow out of the bladder. Then he’ll order X-rays and/or an ultrasound of the bladder and kidneys to confirm the diagnosis and to see if any damage has occurred to the upper urinary tract. Your pediatrician will consult with a  pediatric nephrologist  (kidney specialist) or nurologist, who may recommend surgery to remove the obstructing valves and prevent further infection or damage to the kidneys or urinary system.",

        "content": "Most people are born with two kidneys. However, as many as 1 in 1,000 people are born with only one kidney. Usually, children with one kidney are perfectly healthy. However, they do require monitoring to keep their one (single) kidney healthy. Why are some people born with only one kidney? For most people born with one kidney, we do not know why it happens. In a small number of people, being born with one kidney is part of a syndrome. A syndrome means that the child is born with more than one health problem.  In the past, many parents did not even know their child had only one kidney. But today, most pregnant women have an     ultrasound  evaluation of their baby, so most infants with one kidney are discovered before they are born.  Other infants are born with two kidneys but have only one    healthy  kidney because the other kidney did not develop correctly before birth. For other people born with two kidneys, one kidney may be damaged or removed due to an accident, tumor, infections, or (in adults) kidney donation for a kidney transplant. Is it genetic? For most families of a child with one kidney, the risk of a second child with a similar problem is very low. But this should be discussed with your    pediatrician  or obstetrician, who may refer you to a    genetic  counselor.  What are the long-term issues for someone with one kidney? Most people born with one kidney lead full and normal lives. This is why a person with two healthy kidneys can donate one kidney to a person with kidney failure. In a child, a healthy, well-formed single kidney typically grows faster and becomes larger than if the kidney was one of a pair of kidneys. This extra growth is good and helps the single kidney do the work of two kidneys. Your child's pediatrician will perform tests to determine if a single kidney is healthy. These may include:\t Blood and urine tests  to see how well the kidney is working\t Imaging studies  such as an ultrasound to make sure the kidney looks normal and that the urine drains normally Importance of blood pressure & urine checks Some people with a single kidney may develop health problems later in life, such as    high blood pressure  or    protein leaking from the kidney into the urine . Protein in the urine can be a sign of stress on the kidney's filters, and ongoing leakage of large amounts of protein from the kidneys can also cause kidney problems, but this can be controlled. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends yearly screening of children for high blood pressure at their primary care doctor's office. It is reasonable to screen children and adults with a single kidney for protein in the urine.  Is it OK for a child with one kidney to play sports? Fortunately, the kidneys are located deep in the body and are less likely to be injured than the brain, neck, spleen or liver. The AAP recommends that children and adolescents with a single kidney be    allowed to play most sports . This decision, however, should be based on several factors: Advice of your pediatrician, pediatric urologist or pediatric nephrologist Health of the single kidney Current heath of your child Sport in which they are participating  Position they would play Level of competition Relative risk of severe injury In the past, physicians cautioned against contact or collision sports (where intentional contact is expected). However, studies show that the risk of sustaining a kidney injury from football or wrestling is actually quite low. This is why the overall health and wellbeing of the child deserves a discussion with their doctor. Padding designed specifically to protect the kidney should also be considered when making this decision, although little is known about its effectiveness.  What can parents of a child with one kidney do to keep them healthy? Children with a one kidney can lead a normal, healthy life. They do not need special diets if the kidney is working well. They should have regular    well-child care  as recommended by the AAP, including blood pressure measurement. Your doctor may want to screen your child for protein in the urine.\t More information\t High Blood Pressure in Children\t Proteinuria\t Guidelines on Identifying and Treating High Blood Pressure in Children\t Medical Conditions That May Rule Out Sports Participation\t Prevention is The Best Medicine: Sports Safety Guidelines",

        "content": "​​​​​​​​If someone has chronic kidney disease (CKD)​, it means their kidneys are damaged and aren't filtering blood effectively. The condition affects people of all ages and backgrounds, including children. What are common causes of CKD in kids? Infants and children\t Birth defects  like         posterior urethral valves  and         diseases  found in families, such as polycystic kidney disease, are the most common causes of CKD in children.​\t Urinary tract abnormalities  could potentially lead to CKD. For this reason, frequent         urinary tract infections (UTIs)  in children should be promptly treated and further evaluated. Teenagers\t Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\t (FSGS).  In children over 12 years old,         FSGS  is one of the most common causes of CKD.\t Lupus.  Another common cause of CKD in teens ​is systemic lupus erythematosus ( lupus ). What are common symptoms of CKD in children? CKD is often not associated with symptoms in the early stages. B​ut as CKD gets worse, symptoms in children may include:     \t Swelling  and/or puffiness around the eyes, feet and ankles\t Frequent urination  or, in children 5 years or older, prolonged            bedwetting​\t Stunted or poor growth , as compared to similar age group peers\t Loss of appetite  and chronic nausea\t Fatigue\t Frequent severe headaches  from high blood pressure\t   Anemia​   and pallor from decreased red blood cell production How is CKD diagnosed? CKD is diagnosed in many ways. Some kidney problems are found before birth by      ultrasound . Sometimes, children are diagnosed with other conditions where kidney problems are known to be more common. Often, the symptoms listed above prompt your child's doctor to run tests that lead to a diagnosis of CKD. Based on a child's health issues or symptoms, their pediatrician may run the following tests:\t Urinalysis.  A child's urine will be collected to check for protein.            Proteinuria  may be a sign of kidney damage.\t Blood tests.  Creatinine or cystatin are used to estimate the level of kidney function. Chemicals in the blood, such as potassium and sodium, as well as red blood cell counts, may be abnormal when a child has CKD. There are also special blood tests that may help diagnose specific kidney diseases such as lupus nephritis.\t Ultrasound.  Pictures of the kidneys help show any damage to the kidney and surrounding structures. They may also give hints about what caused the kidney problem.\t Kidney biopsy.  A small piece of kidney tissue is taken out and examined under a microscope to determine the cause of and extent of damage to the kidneys. How is the severity of CKD determined? CKD is staged to show how much kidney function is left. Because kidney function decreases over time, the stage of CKD changes. Mild CKD is Stage 1. The most severe CKD is Stage 5. When a person is first diagnosed with CKD, it could be in any of the five stages.\t A value called the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  is estimated from the creatinine blood test and is used to find the stage of CKD. Note that eGFR values are used only for CKD staging for children older than 2 years of age, because the eGFR values for children under two are normally lower due to ongoing kidney growth.\t In some cases, the eGFR will need to be confirmed with other tests to be sure that the CKD stage is accurate. The kidney doctor (nephrologist) will track the eGFR and creatinine levels over time to help determine the treatment plan.  How is CKD treated? CKD is diagnosed when there is permanent damage to the kidneys that cannot be cured. However, there have been major improvements in the care of children with CKD. These can slow the worsening of the disease and can help prevent or delay the development of CKD Stage 5 and the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant. The main goals of treatment for CKD are to: Treat the condition that is causing CKD Treat complications of CKD like high blood pressure, anemia and poor growth  Slow down worsening of CKD with medications that reduce protein in the urine In some children, prepare for eventual kidney failure (Stage 5) Who is involved in the medical care for a child with CKD? The child's pediatrician will continue to oversee routine healthcare, including      immunizations  (vaccines). Your child's primary care provider will work with the      pediatric nephrologist  who will direct the treatment of your child's CKD. Other      pediatric specialists , such as a renal dietitian and a pediatric urologist, may be included on the care team based on the child's health care needs. Parents and other caretakers are essential members of the health care team, providing emotional support and helping the child follow the proper diet and take prescribed medications. How does CKD usually affect a child's day-to-day activities? Most children with CKD lead active lives. They can attend and do well in school. They can usually plan the same sports as other children.

        "content": "By: Joseph McQuaid, MD, MPH, FAAP Does this sound familiar? Your child is toilet trained, but still has frequent daytime accidents. It might be a common condition known as      voiding dysfunction , and your child isn't alone! As many as 20% of school-age children have at least one symptom of voiding dysfunction, according to some studies. Voiding dysfunction is not typically diagnosed until a child is over age 4 and continues to have daytime accidents for at least 6 months after      toilet training  ends. What is Voiding Dysfunction?\t A pattern of problems with urination that's not typical for a child's age and stage of development is called  voiding dysfunction . Other medical terms for the condition include bladder dysfunction and lower urinary tract dysfunction.   Your Child's Bladder Function:  What's Normal, What's Not? A healthy lower urinary system has two basic functions: it stores urine and empties urine (voiding). Typically, these abilities develop over time.\t \t  All infants start out incontinent, meaning they have no control over when their bladder empties.  Most children begin to have daytime bladdar control by age 4. Staying dry overnight―called nighttime urinary continence―usually follows within a few months after a child has daytime control.   Once children are toilet trained, if the bladder isn't storing or emptying urine the way it should, they may have symptoms including:\t Too many or two few trips to the bathroom . The number of times children should empty their bladders each day depends on their age and the amount of fluids they take in. In general, everyone should urinate every 2 or 3 hours. But there may be an underlying problem with storing urine if a child pees an abnormally high or low number of times each day.   \t Urgency.  A frequent, sudden, and unexpected need to pee can indicate an overactive bladder (OAB). This condition happens when muscles in the urinary tract squeeze at the wrong time. Kids with OAB often try to \"hold it\" (usually unsuccessfully) by crossing their legs. Most have frequent accidents and some develop urinary tract infections (UTIs). \t Leakage.  Urine may leak throughout the day (diurnal enuresis). In some cases, it may be triggered by laughing, sneezing or coughing. Or, it can happen at night―called            nocturnal enuresis . These problems may also point to a possible issue with urine storage.\t Problems with flow.  this can take different form, including: Hesitancy: difficulty starting a urinary stream when a child is otherwise ready to pee. The child may stand over or sit on the toilet for several seconds or even minutes before the urine stream gets going. Straining: a great effort is needed to start and finish emptying the bladder. Weak or broken stream: when the flow of urine is either weak, like a dribble. Or it may have several, separate start and stop points. Pain: a child may have pain or discomfort during urination, which is called dysuria.      \t Frequent  constipation  with daytime accidents . Studies show almost ALL children with voiding dysfunction also have some form of constipation or bowel dysfunction. In many cases, treating the constipation is addressed first, which can improve bladder symptoms.\t If you think your child has any of these bladder issues or symptoms, call your pediatrician. You might be referred to a pediatric urologist for further examination. \t   What Causes Voiding Dysfunction in Children? Voiding dysfunction is caused by an inability to appropriately store urine and completely empty the bladder.  When children urinate, the bladder squeezes down and the urinary sphincter relaxes. When this voiding cycle doesn't happen as it should, it can result in poor bladder emptying.  Sometimes this is due to a neurological problem, but often it's a learned (functional) problem.\t Neurogenic causes.  Children with nervous system (neurogenic) causes may have conditions from birth (congenital anomalies) that affect the spinal cord or brain such as            spina bifida  or            cerebral palsy , or genetic disorders such as Williams Syndrome. These can affect the coordination between the bladder and urinary sphincter. Voiding dysfunction can also happen with            epilepsy ,            diabetes , and            injury to the spine , but these are much less much less common of causes.\t Functional causes.  For some children with voiding dysfunction, there are no physical causes that can be narrowed down. These so-called \"functional causes\" or \"non-neurogenic\" cases of voiding dysfunction can come from            stress , for example, or poor toilet training habits. Some children become so caught up in activities that they forget or delay going to the bathroom. Not drinking enough fluids to fill up the bladder regularly also can contribute to a pattern of \"holding it\" too long. Posture on the toilet can also affect urinary symptoms.  The Links Between Bladder Dysfunction & Neuropsychiatric Disorders\t A recent study   showed that 60% of patients seen for voiding dysfunction had at least one psychosocial disorder―in addition to having had experienced stressful,  adverse childhood experiences   (ACEs). Other studies have shown children with  ADHD   have significantly higher rates of incontinence, constipation, urgency, infrequent voiding, nocturnal enuresis and dysuria than those without ADHD. \t These links are important for all parents to take note of as children develop and possibly face mental health challenges, neurological diagnoses, and treatments .  \t Mental illness increases the risk of both bowel and bladder problems—especially in children.  A mental health condition may interfere with a child's ability to reach the toilet on time because of disorganized thinking, confusion, or inattention. \t Some  medications used to treat conditions  such as anxiety or obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD) can affect the bladder and bowel, making a child less aware of when he or she needs to use the toilet.  If your child is taking certain medications and is starting to have daytime accidents, voiding dysfunction may be a side effect.  \t Talk with your child's doctors about any new behavio rs you've noticed since starting any medication and keep a record of how oft en these behaviors occur.   How is Voiding Dysfunction Diagnosed? Your pediatrician may refer you to a      pediatric urologist  for an exam. The doctor may:\t Ask about your child's urinating habits and bowel function . Often, a voiding diary―a daily log to track how much and how frequently your child urinates―is a good first step.\t Take a family and social history . It helps to know if family members have or had similar problems, because bladder problems can sometime be hereditary. It is also helpful to understand more about the child's school environment and schedule. Sources of stress or changes in routine can contribute to urinary problems, such as an            adverse childhood event  or trauma.\t Order tests.  These may include            imaging tests  like an abdominal x-ray, kidney and bladder ultrasounds, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine. In some cases, it can be helpful to use x-rays to watch different parts of the voiding cycle with a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG).            Uroflow  testing can help determine problems with urine flow by having the child use a special toilet with measuring instruments. How is Voiding Dysfunction in Children Treated? Because voiding dysfunction often is tied to      urinary tract infections  and VUR, it is best to treat the condition without delay. The specific treatment the doctor recommends will depend on what's causing your child's voiding dysfunction. While surgery can help in some cases, there are many other treatment options that can be effective, particularly for children with functional causes of voiding dysfunction.  Non-surgical treatment options for children with voiding dysfunction:\t Avoiding and treating constipation.  By making sure children get enough            fiber  in their diet, drink enough            water  and other healthy beverages, and taking a prescribed laxative in some cases can improve constipation and voiding dysfunction at the same time.  \t Behavioral training for wetting.  In some cases, the best treatment is to revisit potty-training basics. For daytime wetting, making sure the child urinates every 2-3 hours during the day, for example, and keeping track of fluid intake can help. For children with nighttime wetting, bed alarms often aid children in waking up in time to empty their bladders.\t Pelvic floor therapy.  Exercises to work on abnormal pelvic floor muscle contractions can help with voiding dysfunction. Some types of pelvic floor physical therapy for children use biofeedback in the form of video games, teaching children when it is the right time to relax or contract their pelvic muscles.\t Medications.  There are medications that may be recommended to help ease overactive bladder contractions and address certain types of incontinence. 4 Things for Parents to Remember: \t Voiding dysfunction is a common problem faced by many children and many parents. You aren't alone with this. \t Pediatric urologists treat these conditions all the time and there are many excellent options available to help your child achieve healthy bladder function. \t Don't let self-esteem issues, shame, isolation, poor school performance, aggressiveness, and other behavioral changes impact your child or your family. \t Help is available. Talking with your pediatrician about any symptoms is the first step! \t   Additional Information:\t Vesicoureteral Reflux in Infants & Young Children\t Prevent Urinary Tract Infections in Children\t Constipation in Children\t   About Dr. McQuaid:\t Joseph McQuaid, MD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor of Urology at the University of Massachusetts and specializes in all aspects of pediatric urologic care.

UTIs may go untreated because the symptoms may not be obvious to the child or to parents. \t Normal urine has no germs (bacteria). However, bacteria can get into the urinary tract from two sources: the skin around the rectum and genitals and the bloodstream from other parts of the body. Bacteria may cause infections in any or all parts of the urinary tract, including the following:\t the urethra (called \"urethritis\")\t the bladder (called \"cystitis\")\t the kidneys (called \"pyelonephritis\")\t UTIs are common in infants and young children. About 3 percent of girls and 1 percent of boys will have a UTI by 11 years of age. A young child with a high fever and no other symptoms, has a 1 in 20 chance of having a UTI. The frequency of UTIs in girls is much greater than in boys. Uncircumcised boys have slightly more UTIs than those who have been circumcised.\t Symptoms\t Symptoms of UTIs may include the following:\t fever\t pain or burning during urination\t need to urinate more often, or difficulty getting urine out\t urgent need to urinate, or wetting of underwear or bedding by a child who knows how to use the toilet\t vomiting, refusal to eat\t abdominal pain\t side or back pain\t foul-smelling urine\t cloudy or bloody urine\t unexplained and persistent irritability in an infant\t poor growth in an infant\t Treatment\t UTIs are treated with antibiotics. The way your child receives the antibiotic depends on the severity and type of infection. If your child has a fever or is vomiting and unable to keep fluids down, the antibiotics may be put directly into the bloodstream or muscle using a needle. This is usually done in the hospital. Otherwise, the antibiotics can be given by mouth, as liquid or pills.\t UTIs need to be treated right away for the following reasons:\t to get rid of the infection\t to prevent the spread of the infection\t to reduce the chances of kidney damage\t Infants and young children with UTIs usually need to take antibiotics for 7 to 14 days, sometimes longer. Make sure your child takes all the medicine your pediatrician prescribes. Do not stop giving your child the medicine until the pediatrician says the treatment is finished, even if your child feels better. UTIs can return if not fully treated",

        "content": "​By: Beth Vogt, MD, FAAP & Craig Langman, MD, FAAP Dialysis is a medical treatment that does some of the jobs that the kidneys usually do. Children whose own kidneys work poorly (usually less than 10% of normal) need dialysis.   While dialysis treatments do just a small part of the work that healthy kidneys do, they provide just enough to keep a child with kidney failure from getting very sick.  What does dialysis do? Dialysis helps keep a child's body in balance by: Removing extra fluid  to prevent body swelling and help reduce high blood pressure Removing wastes  like phosphorus and potassium that can harm the body if amounts in the blood get too high  Does dialysis help the kidneys work better? No, unfortunately dialysis does not improve the health of a child's kidneys. Instead, it takes over some of the things the kidneys do.  What is the difference between peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis?  There are two different types of dialysis – peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD). PD is done using a soft tube in the abdomen (belly) that connects to a dialysis machine. HD is done by pulling the child's blood from either a catheter or an access in the arm and sending it in a loop through the dialysis machine. PD is done at home and HD can be done at a dialysis center or in the home. How do I decide what is the right type of dialysis for my child? This is a big decision that depends on a lot of factors – your child's age, medical condition and your family's preference. Dialysis teams understand the pros and cons of PD and HD very well and can help you make the best decision for your child. We encourage parents and children to discuss both types of dialysis before making a decision.  Who takes care of a child on dialysis? The head of the team is the      nephrologist  (kidney doctor). Dialysis nurses and technicians provide the treatments. Dialysis nurses teach and support the family of children on PD and home HD.  Other important people on the dialysis team include the dietitian, the social worker and many others including a psychologist, child life specialist and teacher. And of course, the child and the parents and caregivers are the most important part of the team. Do children on dialysis need a special diet? Most children on dialysis have dietary (food) restrictions, but these are different for each child.  Common restrictions include avoiding foods high in sodium (salt), potassium, and phosphorus. Many children on dialysis must limit their daily intake of fluids to help them not gain too much weight from excess water that builds up in the body between dialysis treatments.  Restrictions on food and fluid are common in children treated with HD, but also are important for those on PD. Some children on dialysis may also need nutritional supplements such as extra protein and vitamins to help them grow and stay healthy.  Can children on dialysis go to school? Yes! Children on PD can go to school regularly since PD treatments are done at night while they are sleeping. Children on HD can also attend school, but will commonly have shortened school days when they must go to the dialysis center for treatment. Children can do schoolwork during treatments and may get help from a dialysis unit teacher or a tutor.  Many children on dialysis qualify for an  IEP​  (individualized education program) to help make their school experience the best it can be.  Is dialysis forever? Children with kidney failure can live for a long time with the support of dialysis treatments. But treatment with dialysis is usually not the long-term goal since dialysis only replaces a small part of what normal kidneys do. In addition, it takes a lot of time and effort from the child and family.  The plan for most children is to use dialysis as a \"bridge\" to a kidney transplant. Children usually feel much better, have more energy and appetite and can enjoy a more normal lifestyle following successful kidney transplantation.

        "content": "​​The first question new parents ask is      \"Is it a boy or a girl?\"  However, for an estimated 1 in 2,000 children born each year, this is a difficult question to answer. These are children born with a      disorder of sex development (DSD)  – a group of about 60 conditions in which biological sex, or being male or female, is not clear.  Before birth, in the first weeks of     \t pregnancy , females and males look nearly identical. Then, because of a complicated interaction between genes and chemicals called hormones, the differences we have come to expect slowly take shape.    What is a Disorder of Sex Development?  A DSD is a mismatch between a child's chromosomes, or genetic material, and the appearance of the child's genitals. A child may present with a DSD in infancy, childhood or adolescence.  Previously, DSDs were called      \"intersex\" conditions . This means \"between the sexes.\" However, this term felt uncomfortable to some people with who identified themselves as strongly male or strongly female. \t   Note:  Most people with a DSD prefer the term \"Difference\" of Sex Development rather than \"Disorder,\" because the word \"disorder\" implies that there is something \"wrong\" with the person rather than a natural variation.  Mild DSDs\t Hypospadias:  When a boy has a urinary opening on the underside of the penis instead of at the tip.\t Clitoromegaly:  When a girl's clitoris is larger than average.  Significant DSDs\t Ambiguous genitalia:  When it is not clear whether a child is male or female by looking at the genitals.   What Causes DSDs?  A genetic change that may or may not be        \t inherited  from a parent.  Unknown exposure to certain medications or hormones during pregnancy.  A developmental problem in the baby during pregnancy that prevents the production of enough of his or her own hormones         (e.g. lack of blood flow to the ovaries or testes) . A developmental problem that causes the bladder or lower abdomen to not form properly         (e.g. cloacal exstrophy) . There is No One To Blame  The most important thing to realize is that it is not the fault of the parent that a child has a difference of sex development. Parents have no control over     \t which genes are passed on to a child , or whether there is a developmental problem causing a DSD. The best thing to do for a child is to love and accept them as they are.  Medical Management: A Team Approach  A team of medical professionals may be involved in the care of a child born with a DSD, depending on the severity. This team consists of     \t pediatric specialists  in:\t Endocrinology\t Surgery\t Urology\t Psychology  and        \t Psychiatry Gynecology\t Genetics\t Neonatology\t Social work Nursing Medical ethics Infants with ambiguous genitalia, for example, may see all of the pediatric specialists mentioned above. Which doctors each child needs depends on his or her own characteristics. Treatment  The family and the team of doctors will determine the best way to help the child have a happy and healthy life. This may include     \t treatment  with medications or surgery. In some cases, there is no treatment needed. It is important to discuss the risks and benefits of each treatment thoughtfully with the child's future well-being in mind.      If it is not medically necessary, any irreversible procedure can be postponed until the child is old enough to agree to the procedure \t   (e.g. genital surgery) .   DSD & Gender Identity The medical community used to think that      gender identity\t (the feeling that a person is a boy or a girl) , was learned or taught. However, we now know it is influenced by genetics, exposure to hormones while still in the mother's uterus and other factors that are not known yet. For example:  Some girls with         Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome  actually have a Y chromosome typical for a boy, but their body does not respond typically to the testosterone produced. They develop as, and often identify as, girls.   Some girls with a condition called         Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia  produce too much testosterone. These girls can show behaviors more typical for boys, but most of them still identify as girls.  Most individuals with mild DSDs identify with the gender that is consistent with their chromosomes; boys if they have an X and a Y chromosome, and girls if they have two X chromosomes. However, in children with ambiguous genitalia, where it is not possible to tell if the child is a boy or a girl from the outside, the child's gender identity may not be easy to predict. Determining the Gender of a Child with a Significant DSD Determining the gender of a child with a significant DSD or ambiguous genitalia is especially challenging when the child is too young to say whether they feel like a boy or a girl. In this case, the parents and the medical team will work together and gather as much information as possible about what the future may hold for the child.   Regardless of the male or female gender assigned at birth, sometimes the team and the family are incorrect. In this case, once the child is old enough to state his or her own identity, he or she may choose to live that gender instead.  \t Additional Resources: \t   Accord Alliance  - A patient advocacy group that promotes the health and wellbeing of people affected with DSDs and their families. \t   The AIS-DSD Support Group  - A network dedicated to children and adults with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome and other DSDs. \t   Answers to Your Questions About Children with Intersex Conditions  (American Psychological  Association)\t Sex Development: An Overview   (The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada) - An interactive demonstration of sex development including movies, diagrams, and illustrations to help individuals understand how and why DSDs happen.",

        "content": "​By: Jennifer Ahn, MD, MS & ​Jason Van Batavia, MD, MSTR​ Some children are born with or develop problems in the genitourinary tract, made up of the kidneys, bladder and reproductive organs. When this happens, there are various treatments and repairs to help them lead healthy lives. This includes genitourinary (GU) reconstruction, which means modifying or repairing the genitourinary tract with surgery.  Here are common genitourinary tract conditions that can be helped with genitourinary reconstruction.  Bladder exstrophy  Bladder exstrophy is a rare congenital birth defect that happens when the bladder and abdominal wall do not form properly. In children born with this condition, the bladder is open and exposed on the abdomen. In addition, the urethra and genitals (clitoris in females and head of the penis in males) are split in half.  Diagnosis & treatment Bladder exstrophy is often diagnosed before birth with a      prenatal ultrasound . After a diagnosis, families should meet with a      pediatric urologist  to discuss the condition, what to expect at birth, and surgical options. For babies diagnosed at delivery, a pediatric urologist and often pediatric orthopedic surgeon will be called to talk with the family and develop a reconstructive plan.  Bladder exstrophy requires reconstructive surgery to close the bladder and abdominal wall. It may also involve fixing abnormalities of the hip bones and genitals. Repair can require multiple surgeries, lengthy hospital stays, and close and regular follow up. Depending on the type of surgery, the child may need a cast or need to stay immobile for some time to heal.  Surgery for bladder exstrophy can be done days to several months after the baby is born, depending on the child's case. The goals of surgery are good bladder function, being able to hold urine without leakage (continence), and acceptable external genitalia appearance and function. However, the long-term goal is to maintain normal kidney function.  Cloacal anomalies  ​During fetal development, three openings form to create the genital, intestinal, and urinary tracts. When these do not fully separate in a female it is called a cloacal anomaly. The most severe form is called persistent cloaca. With this condition, the vagina, urethra, and rectum all drain into the same tract or cavity.  Diagnosis & treatment Diagnosis in newborns is based on the absence of an anus and an abnormal-looking vaginal opening. Repair of cloacal anomalies involves creating a colostomy (bringing part of the intestines out to the skin to drain stool into a bag) soon after birth. In some cases, urine may then drain normally. However, additional surgery may be needed to place a tube into the bladder or vagina, or to create an opening between the bladder and the abdominal wall (called a vesicostomy).  Surgery to create an anus and separate the genital (vagina) and urinary (urethra/bladder) tracts can take place when the child is older. Specific timing of this surgery depends on how severe the condition is and factors such as the child's rate of growth. It usually involves a team that includes pediatric surgeons, pediatric urologists, and pediatric gynecologists. The goal is to create anatomy that resembles that of a typical female and to avoid incontinence. Additional surgery or procedures may be needed to keep the genital tract open and working properly.  Other GU reconstruction proced​ures children may need: Bladder augmentat​ion  Bladders are meant to store urine at low pressures until the bladder is ready to be emptied. When bladders are too small or have too much pressure that can cause kidney damage, bladder augmentation (or expansion) may be needed.  In bladder augmentation surgery, part of the intestinal tract is taken and placed onto the bladder to make it larger. The bladder then needs to be catheterized using a flexible tube inserted through a narrow opening to empty it. Often, a channel is created at the same time.  Follow-up care is aimed at preventing complications such as bladder infections, stones and tears caused by poor drainage. The chances of other possible complications, such as electrolytes problems or too much acid in the blood, depend on which part of the intestinal tract was used for the surgery. If your child has abdominal pain or blood in the urine after bladder augmentation surgery, contact your doctor immediately.  After bladder augmentation, a child may be at higher risk for cancer near area of intestine used in the surgery, or in the bladder itself. Because of this, children who have this procedure need continued follow up with a pediatric urologist or surgeon.  Appendicovesicostomy (Mitro​​fanoff)  This surgery creates a channel from the skin on the abdomen to the bladder so a catheter (drainage tube) can be put in to empty the bladder. The child's appendix is usually used to create the channel. The opening of the channel on the abdomen may be brought out through the belly button to make it less noticeable. The new channel should allow the child to hold urine. However, if incontinence does develop, this can be treated with medication or surgery.  Bladder neck proc​edures Some conditions leave a child's bladder neck, an area that connects the bladder to the urethra, weak or open. This can contribute to urine leakage. There are a handful of surgical options to address this. These include injecting a filler material or placing an artificial urethral sphincter (the muscle that controls how the ureter opens and closes).  Other options more common in children include bladder neck reconstruction. This surgery makes the bladder neck narrower and tighter, preventing urine from leaking out as easily. Surgery can also be done to close the bladder neck, disconnecting it from the urethra. This requires an alternate way to drain the bladder, often an appendicovesicostomy (see above). In another procedure, a sling can be made from the patient's own tissues (usually from the abdominal wall), or synthetic material.  MACE (Malone Antegrade Continence​ Enema)  Children with bladder issues often will also have bowel problems, especially      constipation . Severe constipation may lead to symptoms like      abdominal pain , nausea, vomiting. It can also cause incomplete bladder emptying and urinary tract infections. Some need to use enemas to be able to empty their colons of stool. For these children, a Malone Antegrade Continence Enema (MACE) can help. The surgery uses the appendix or a piece of the intestines to create the channel from the skin on the abdomen to the colon, allowing a catheter to be placed that delivers the enema directly to the colon. This makes it easier for the parent and child to clean out the colon and prevent constipation.  Remember If your pediatrician suggests that your child visit a pediatric urologist to discuss GU reconstruction, rest assured that they have most extensive and comprehensive training to evaluate your child's specific needs. They can also offer a wide range of treatment options to improve your child's quality of life.

        "content": "​​By: ​​Darcy Weidemann, MD, FAAP & \t Nazia Kulsum-Mecci MD​ It is not uncommon for children to sometimes have blood in their urine (pee). Sometimes, it can change the color of the urine. Blood in a child's urine can have different causes, many of which go away on their own or are easily treated. What is hematuria?\t   Blood in the urine is called      hematuria .      Microscopic hematuria  is when the urine looks normal in the toilet or a cup, but blood can be seen when looking at the urine with a microscope.      Gross hematuria  is when blood can be seen in the toilet or in a cup. The urine may look pink, red, or the color of tea or cola. Blood in urine can come from anywhere in the urinary tract. Blood may come from the kidneys, the ureters (tubes that connect the kidneys to the bladder), the bladder (where urine is stored), or the urethra (the tube from the bladder to the outside of the body). Many healthy children have microscopic hematuria that goes away in a few weeks. \t ​ Keep in mind: dark or red-colored urine does not always mean there is blood in the urine. Sometimes, certain medications or food colorin​​gs can cause the urine color to change. But it is important to talk with your pediatrician if you aren't sure of the cause. ​ What causes hematuria?  Causes of hematuria in children include: Vigorous exercise\t Urinary tract infections High calcium levels in the urine (called hypercalciuria) Kidney stones Trauma or injury Structural problems or blockage in the urinary tract Genetic conditions Inflammatory kidney disease ( glomerulonephritis ) Cancer (very rare)  What tests might be done? Some or all of the below tests may be done in cases of hematuria, depending on what symptoms your child has: \t Urine dipstick . This is usually done in your doctor's office. It can test for hematuria. Sometimes, the test results may be wrong, so the presence of actual red blood cells in the urine must be confirmed by looking at the urine with a microscope. \t Renal and bladder ultrasound . This looks for cysts, kidney stones, tumors, and many other causes of hematuria. \t Urine culture . This test looks for urinary tract infection.\t Serum creatinine . This blood test checks how well the kidneys are working. \t Complete blood count (CBC) . This blood test checks for            anemia  (not enough red blood cells) and evidence of            infection  (increased white blood cell count). \t Complement proteins . This blood test helps diagnose some causes of kidney disease called glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the kidney). \t Urine calcium . This test checks for high levels of calcium in the urine. High urine calcium can result in            kidney stones  or blood in the urine even in the absence of stones. \t Urine protein . This test can sometimes help distinguish between hematuria that is caused by the kidney itself or from the piping of the urinary tract (ureters, bladder, urethra). Persistent protein in the urine along with hematuria sometimes suggests a problem with the kidneys. \t Kidney biopsy . This test is needed when the doctor thinks there may be damage to the filters of the kidneys. A kidney biopsy is performed in the hospital. The child is first put to            sleep  with medication. A needle is then used to take a small sample of kidney tissue. Most children with blood in the urine do not need this test. \t Cystoscopy . This test looks for bleeding from the ureter, bladder, or urethra. It is uncommon for children to need cystoscopy. For this test, the doctor (a            pediatric urologist ) inserts a narrow tube with a tiny camera at the end of it to look at the bladder and urethra for the cause of the hematuria. What treatment options are there? Treatment depends on what is causing the hematuria. Often times, no treatment is needed. Infections are treated with antibiotics. If there is a high level of calcium in the urine, diet changes may be recommended such as low      salt  in food and drinking more water. Sometimes, medication may also be prescribed to help lower calcium levels in the urine.  In patients with glomerulonephritis, treatment includes medications such as steroids or other stronger medications that decrease inflammation in the kidney. In some children, medication is also given to control high blood pressure.  Kidney stones do not always require treatment, but may need to be removed if they are causing pain or infections. If your child is forming kidney stones, they may need additional urine and/or blood testing to help prevent future stones.  In about 1 out of 4 cases, doctors may not be able to find the cause for the hematuria. If all tests are normal and blood remains in the urine, yearly checkups are recommended to make sure the patient does not begin to develop kidney disease.  When should I contact the doctor?

        "content": "​Kidney cysts are round pouches of fluid that form in the kidneys and are typically less than 1 inch in diameter. The simple kidney cyst is different from the cysts that develop when a person has polycystic kidney disease (PKD), a genetic disease. Simple Kidney Cysts  Simple kidney cysts are often detected during an      imaging test (e.g. ultrasound, CT, MRI)  being done for another condition, because they rarely cause pain or other symptoms. It is not clear what causes simple kidney cysts, although the risk of having one increases with age. Simple kidney cysts in children are rare. Complex Kidney Cysts  While cysts are commonly a simple sack of fluid, they can have multiple chambers, like a bag of grapes. These cysts are called complex, or septated, cysts. Septations are walls within the cyst. Having many or thick walled septations suggests a low but possible      cancer  risk. If the cyst is complex,      your doctor  may repeat the imaging test a few months later to be sure it is not growing and becoming cancerous. Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney  Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is a condition that occurs when a kidney is not put together correctly when it forms in the womb. The result is a non-functioning kidney full of cysts and scar tissue. Fortunately, the remaining kidney is usually able to take over all kidney function. In infants with MCDK, however, the remaining kidney may have an abnormality. Your doctor may do more tests to evaluate this kidney.\t Incidence:  MCDK affects 1 in every 4,000 babies. \t Diagnosis:  70% of MCDK cases are diagnosed by         ultrasound before a baby is born . \t Prevention:  There is no way to prevent MCDK from occurring early in a baby's development, and there is no known way to prevent it from happening later in life.\t Outlook:  A baby with MCDK and no other birth defects has a normal life expectancy. For         a child with only one kidney that works , that kidney may be a little bigger than normal. She will need follow-up care for life to make sure the kidney remains healthy.  Polycystic Kidney Disease  Kidney cysts can also be caused by a      genetic mutation . The most common form of this is PKD, in which cysts can replace the kidney over time and cause kidney failure. There are two forms: autosomal dominant (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive (ARPKD).  Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Large kidney cysts are associated with ADPKD. They often begin to appear in childhood, although most affected children and teens have no symptoms until they are adults.   \t Incidence:  ADPKD affects 1 in 500. It does not skip a generation. There is usually a family history of ADPKD. A parent with ADPKD has a 50% chance of passing the disease on to each of their children. \t Symptoms:  Often the first sign is         high blood pressure ,         blood in the urine , or a feeling of heaviness or pain in the back, sides, or abdomen. Sometimes, the first sign is a         urinary tract infection (UTI)  and or         kidney stones .\t Diagnosis:\t Children with a family history of ADPKD should have periodic urinalyses and blood pressure measurements to identify early manifestations of the disease. It is            not  recommended for otherwise healthy children and teens to have kidney-imaging tests done, regardless of whether a parent has ADPKD. One reason is that it may adversely affect the child’s insurability, even if there are no symptoms yet. Routine genetic testing of potentially affected children and teens is also            not  recommended.            Note:  These recommendations may change with advances in the treatment of ADPKD.      \t Outlook:  There is currently no accepted therapy to prevent cysts from forming or enlarging.  Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease Enlarged kidneys with tiny cysts are associated with ARPDK. Sometimes, the kidneys are so large and function so poorly that infants are born with      severe respiratory problems  and do not survive.  \t Incidence:  ARPKD is relatively rare and occurs in 1 in 20,000.  \t Diagnosis:  Most   ARPKD cases are diagnosed by ultrasound before a baby is born. \t Outlook:  Most children with ARPKD have high blood pressure and progressive kidney failure. They will need to be on kidney dialysis and or receive a kidney         transplant  by late childhood to survive. A number of these children will also develop liver disease, leading to esophageal bleeding and ultimately liver failure.     Physical Activity & Children with Cystic Kidney Disease Very large cysts can rupture with minor trauma and lead to blood in the urine and occasionally severe hemorrhaging.      Your child's doctor  will help decide if physical activity should be limited. It is possible that children with large kidneys and/or large cysts will have more episodes of blood in the urine if they play contact sports, such as      football .  Outlook for Children with Kidney Cysts The number of cysts a child has affects his signs and symptoms. In most children, kidney cysts grow very slowly, if at all, and cause no problems. Therefore, there is no treatment needed.  If a cyst becomes very large, it may cause      side or stomach pain  or interfere with the kidney's function. However, it is extremely rare to do surgery on a cyst. Typically, a cyst is removed or drained if it is infected and not responding well to antibiotics or is causing significant pain. A      pediatric nephrologist  and a      pediatric urologist  work together to decide whether to remove kidney cysts. \t Note:  Surgery can only remove a limited number of cysts in children with cystic kidney disease. After surgery, the smaller cysts can continue to enlarge. This means the surgery is not the final treatment and further care is needed for long-term management.

        "content": "Kidney stones have become more common in children and teens over the past 20 years. They can occur in children of any age, even  premature infants , but most stones occur in teens. Kidney stones happen when minerals and other substances normally found in urine join together to form a hard stone in the urinary tract. They can also form if there is not enough of other substances in the urine that help stop stones from forming. Stones typically form in the kidney and ureter, the tube that connects the kidney to the bladder. They rarely form in the bladder. Types of kidney stones There are many types of kidney stones, but the most common among U.S. children are calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones. Less often, stones are made of uric acid (a waste product from eating certain foods and drinks), an amino acid (a building block of protein) called cystine, or the mineral struvite. How big are kidney stones? Kidney stones vary in size, with most about 1/8-1/4 inch. If a child passes a stone while peeing, it is helpful to collect it if possible so your doctor can send it for lab testing. Finding out what the stone is made of can help your child's doctor find ways to stop more stones from forming.  Risk factors for kidney stones\t   There are many risk factors for forming kidney stones. Some of the most common ones are:  Family tendency to form stones A diet high in salt, meat, and processed foods, and low in fruits and vegetables Low urine output from not drinking enough fluid Other risk factors include: Specific inherited conditions ( hyperoxaluria ,     cystinuria ) Certain medicines, such as the seizure drug topiramate, for example, or the blood pressure drug furosemide, which removes excess water from the body Blocked urine flow Kidney infection Not enough physical activity, as when wearing a cast after surgery. This can cause calcium to leave the bones, so that an excess amount builds up in the urinary tract and contributes to stone formation. Bowel disease Surgery for weight loss  Signs & symptoms of kidney stones \t Stones can form in a child's kidney without causing symptoms for a long time. However, if a stone starts to move down the urinary tract through the tube called the ureter, it can cause symptoms such as: Sudden, severe pain in back or side Nausea and vomiting Groin pain as the stone passes down the urinary tract Severe stomach pain only (young children especially) Burning or pain while peeing. Blood in pee ( hematuria ) Fever and urinary tract infection​  How are kidney stones diagnosed? The diagnosis is usually confirmed when a stone is found in a child's urinary tract by x-ray, ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan.  The preferred test for a child suspected of having a stone is an ultrasound. That's because an ultrasound is easy to do, can detect most stones, and does not use radiation. A    CT scan  can show very small stones, but since this test requires some radiation exposure, many providers will start with an ultrasound. They will then order a CT scan only if a stone is suspected, but not seen with ultrasound. Treatment for kidney stones in children If a kidney stone is causing a child pain, the goals are to help ease discomfort and to help the stone pass down into the bladder and out in the urine. This can sometimes be done at home by drinking large amounts of water and other fluids. Over-the-counter pain medicine like acetaminophen and ibuprofen may be helpful to manage pain. Other oral medications may be prescribed to ease the stone's passage. Your child's doctor may recommend using a strainer to help collect the stone from the urine so it can be tested in the lab. Sometimes, if children are vomiting or have severe pain, they may need to be hospitalized so they can get fluids and stronger pain medicine through a vein. Children with large stones or stones that will not pass on their own may need the help of a urologist, a doctor who specializes in the urinary tract. The urologist may use lithotripsy, a procedure that uses sound waves to break the stone into tiny pieces, which are then passed down the urinary tract. While it may sound scary, it is quite safe and does not damage the kidney. The urologist may also remove the stone by using a scope that enters the bladder and goes up the ureter while your child is under anesthesia. The urologist can then “grab\" the stone and remove it from the body.   How to help preventing kidney stones There are many things that you can help your child do to reduce the chances of developing more kidney stones. Children with kidney stones should: Drink a lot of fluid throughout the day (urine should usually look very pale yellow). Ask your healthcare team for an amount that's right for your child. If your child has kidney disease and needs to limit fluid, please discuss this with the team. Limit     salt  in the diet.​ Eat more fruits and vegetables, especially citrus fruits. Eat fewer meats, processed foods, fast food, and     sodas . Avoid food and drinks with high fructose corn syrup. ​Keep a healthy weight. Eat the recommended amount of calcium-rich foods and drinks. Cutting back calcium in the diet is not recommended and can sometimes actually increase stone risk. On the other hand, don't take a calcium supplement unless your doctor says your child needs one. Your doctor may also recommend that your child see a    pediatric nephrologist , a kidney specialist who treats children with kidney stones. Blood tests and a 24-hour urine collection test may determine why your child formed a kidney stone. With this information, a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) can make specific dietary recommendations and your doctor and health care team can prescribe medicines to reduce your child's risk for making future kidney stones.

        "content": "Ordinarily the lips of skin (labia) surrounding the entrance to the vagina and urethra are separated. Sometimes, they grow together to partially or completely block the opening. This condition, called labial adhesions (sticking together of labia), may occur in the early months of life. Less frequently, it can develop later on if there is constant irritation and inflammation in this area. The problem is usually traceable to  diaper irritation , contact with harsh detergents or underwear made with synthetic fabric. Usually labial adhesions do not cause symptoms, but sometimes they can lead to difficulty with urination and increase a child's risk of  urinary tract infections . If the vaginal opening is significantly blocked, urine and/or vaginal secretions will sometimes build up behind the obstruction. Treatment for labial adhesions If the opening of your child's vagina appears to have closed or looks partially blocked, notify your pediatrician. They will examine your child and advise you whether any treatment is necessary.  The majority of such adhesions require no treatment and resolve on their own as children gets older. In general, if they are not having symptoms like dribbling incontinence after urination or urinary tract infections, no treatment is needed. However, in some cases, the pediatrician may refer your child to a  pediatric surgeon  or  pediatric urologist . Treatment options for labial adhesions include: watchful waiting or observation, treatment with estrogen cream applied a few times daily at home, or manual separation of the adhesions in the office or the operating room with the use of numbing medication.   If estrogen cream is needed, your doctor will instruct you on exactly how and where to apply the cream. Good hygiene, such as giving your child daily  sitz baths, is also important in the treatment and prevention of labial adhesions. You may want to apply a lubricant along the edges to prevent them from sticking back together. It is important to keep in mind that the estrogen cream may result in temporary changes in the appearance of the hymen (tissue at the opening of the vagina) or withdrawal bleeding (like a period). These will resolve after stopping the estrogen cream. As the adhesion opens up, the area may take on a bruised appearance that can be mistaken for trauma. This will go away.",

        "content": "Within a year or two of their first period, 50 to 75 percent of young women begin to experience painful menstrual cramps, or dysmenorrhea. Some cases of      dysmenorrhea  are eventually traced to the gynecologic disorder endometriosis, in which endometrial tissue is located in sites within the pelvic cavity other than the uterus. However, the majority of girls can be reassured that the cramping is related to the production of prostaglandins by the uterus, which is easily remedied. Heavy and irregular bleeding, referred to as  dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) , can indicate serious underlying medical problems in teens. DUB is caused by a disturbance involving the hormones that regulate menstruation, but it is generally painless. But if it's not treated, patients can lose so much blood that they develop severe anemia. Symptoms of Dysmenorrhea: Severe cramping Occasional sharp pains in the lower abdomen, lower back and thighs Sweating Fatigue Headache Faintness Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea How Dysmenorrhea is Diagnosed: Physical examination and thorough medical history (including menstrual history). Symptoms of Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding: Bleeding more frequently than every twenty-one days (counting from the first day of one period to the first day of the next), less frequently than every thirty-five to forty-two days, or longer than seven days. Teens with these types of menstrual bleeding patterns should be medically evaluated. How Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding is Diagnosed: Physical examination, including pelvic exam, and thorough medical history, plus one or more of the following procedures, to test for related complications or evidence of a mass or a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Complete blood count (CBC) Thyroid function tests STD laboratory tests Pregnancy test Measurement of gonadotropins, prolactin and androgens How Menstrual Disorders are treated with Drug Therapy: After exclusion of specific medical conditions, girls may be placed on medications. The cramping of dysmenorrhea is typically addressed with NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) analgesics such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen or naproxen. These medications block the uterus from releasing prostaglandins, naturally occurring chemicals that cause cramps.     \t Oral contraceptives  can also be used to relieve severe menstrual cramps. Hormone treatments, such as oral contraceptives, can also be used for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. NSAIDs may reduce bleeding to some extent, as well.

        "content": "Nephrotic syndrome is a kidney condition that leads to swelling and other symptoms. While it can affect people at any age, nephrotic syndrome usually occurs in children between 2 and 9 years of age.  In children with nephrotic syndrome, tiny filters in the kidneys, called glomeruli, are injured. They let  too much protein leak out  of the blood and into the urine. The low protein levels in the blood cause water to move from the blood and into other parts of the body, such as the face, legs, arms and abdomen (belly). This water in parts of the body is what causes the swelling, also called    edema .  What are the symptoms of nephrotic syndrome? Swelling in the legs, abdomen and around the eyes is usually the first sign of nephrotic syndrome. The eye swelling is usually worse in the morning. Sometimes there may be swelling in the genital area.  Swelling around the eyes may be confused with allergies. However, urine tests that shows large amounts of protein usually point to nephrotic syndrome.  Among other symptoms, your child may say that their urine looks \"foamy.\" High cholesterol in the blood can also happen with nephrotic syndrome. Are there different types of nephrotic syndrome? Yes, there are several types of nephrotic syndrome. The most common type in children is called \"minimal change disease\" (MCD). The cause of MCD is not known. With minimal change disease, the kidney looks normal under the microscope (which is why it is called \"minimal change\") when a small piece of kidney tissue is examined. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is the second most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. FSGS most often occurs in older children and adolescents. In some cases, FSGS may be caused by a genetic abnormality. Most often, though the cause is not known. A kidney biopsy must be done to make the diagnosis of FSGS.  Other rare causes of childhood nephrotic syndrome include congenital nephrotic syndrome (occurs in children less than 3 months of age) and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). Nephrotic syndrome may also be due to disorders such as  lupus , infection or  obesity . How is nephrotic syndrome diagnosed? Sometimes a diagnosis is made from lab results and physical exam. Other times a kidney biopsy is needed to confirm the type of nephrotic syndrome. For a kidney biopsy, the doctor uses a needle to get a small piece of one of the kidneys while your child is sedated.  If your physician thinks your child has MCD, a kidney biopsy typically is not needed. However, if treatment does not stop protein from leaking into the urine, your kidney doctor may do a kidney biopsy. This will help show if the kidney disease is something other than minimal change disease.  Your child's doctor may also decide if a kidney biopsy is needed if: Test results suggest a diagnosis other than MCD. There are signs of poor kidney function (measured by a blood test called creatinine, which is used in a calculation to determine kidney function). A large amount of  blood  is found in the urine. A family history of certain kidney diseases exists. Is there a cure for nephrotic syndrome?  There is no cure for most cases of nephrotic syndrome. However, in most children it can be managed with medications. Many children with minimal change disease will stop having relapses of nephrotic syndrome by late childhood or early teenage years.  How is nephrotic syndrome usually treated? Corticosteroids (medicines called prednisone or prednisolone) are the main treatment for nephrotic syndrome due to minimal change disease. If protein in the urine is severe and blood albumin levels are very low, your doctor may give albumin by an intravenous (IV) injection directly into the bloodstream. In some cases, medicines called diuretics (water pills) may be needed to help the kidneys remove excess fluid.  How do children with nephrotic syndrome typically respond to treatment? About 80% of children with minimal change disease between 2 and 9 years of age will respond to treatment within 3 to 4 weeks. This means protein in the urine and swelling will go away while taking the medication. When protein in the urine goes away completely, this is called remission.  However, many children will have relapse (return) of protein in their urine. Some children will rarely have relapses while others have frequent relapses. Relapses require another course of prednisone, possibly in addition to other medications.  Some children with nephrotic syndrome have steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. This means that protein in the urine does not go away with prednisone treatment. In this case, your child's doctor will consider a kidney biopsy, prescribe other medications and sometimes recommend genetic testing.  Do children with nephrotic syndrome need to follow a special diet?  A low salt ( sodium ) diet to help limit the swelling in the body is often recommended for children with nephrotic syndrome. This is most important when there is protein leaking into the urine. A dietitian who works with the kidney doctor can provide recommendations. Are there complications of nephrotic syndrome? Complications of nephrotic syndrome include infection and blood clots. Some children with nephrotic syndrome other than minimal change disease will eventually develop permanent kidney damage. When this happens, it is called  chronic kidney disease . Permanent damage almost never happens in children with nephrotic syndrome that responds to prednisone. How do I monitor nephrotic syndrome at home? It is important to monitor the urine protein at home using a urine test strip or dipstick. This will help your doctor know when the nephrotic syndrome is in remission and when it may have relapsed. Mo re information Proteinuria in Children",

        "content": "By: Hatim Thaker, MD, FAAP A penile adhesion is a condition where the skin of the penis, or the foreskin in uncircumcised boys, sticks to head of the penis. When these adhesions become dense, they can permanently fuse the skin to the head of the penis. This is called a skin bridge. While this is not a dangerous condition, penile adhesions and skin bridges can sometimes cause discomfort and differences in cosmetic appearance. Here are answers to common questions parents may have.  What causes penile adhesions or skin bridges in babies and children? After a circumcision, any excess  foreskin  or penile skin may \"ride up\" along the shaft of the penis and get stuck to the head. Similarly, if a boy has excess fatty tissue at the base of the penis (or suprapubic region), the head of the penis can \"sink in\" and become surrounded by extra skin (sometimes referred to as \"buried\" or hidden penis). In both situations, there is a risk of adherence between the two skin surfaces. For    uncircumcised  infants, it is normal that the foreskin does not retract completely to expose the head of the penis. However, if the foreskin does not become supple enough to fall back naturally, this may lead to more troublesome adhesions. A consultation with your pediatrician, or a    pediatric urologist , can help distinguish which conditions require treatments, and which do not. What are the symptoms of penile adhesions and skin bridges? This condition typically has no symptoms, though in some cases, the foreskin may become irritated or inflamed. In older boys, dense adhesions may cause discomfort during erections. How do I take care of and treat penile adhesions? Not all penile adhesions need therapy, as some children may outgrow the condition naturally. If needed, a topical steroid ointment can be applied to the adhesions twice daily for six weeks. This will soften the foreskin to make it easier to retract the skin and expose the head of the penis. Some dense adhesions, especially skin bridges, may not improve with topical ointments. These adhesions can be removed in the office with a topical anesthetic, or in the operating room under anesthesia. Mild adhesions can develop into permanent skin bridges after circumcision. As a parent, ensuring that penile skin does not tether itself to the head of the penis during the healing process after circumcision will help prevent adhesions. This can be done by gently pulling the penile skin down. In addition, general penile hygiene is always important. In the areas beneath the adhesion, dead skin cells can accumulate and form a white paste. This is called \" smegma \". This should be gently wiped away during    diaper changes  or cleansed during    baths . More information\t What is Hypospadias?

        "content": "​​​Infections in the throat or on the skin can sometimes cause short term kidney disease in children. This happens when the immune system, which fights off infection, also attacks the kidneys during that fight. This can damage the kidneys and make them less able to filter blood until healing is complete.    Why common infections sometimes cause kidney​problems in children\t The kidneys have about one million tiny units that filter our blood and remove wastes from the body through the urine. Each of these units has a glomerulus (more than one of these structures are called glomeruli).  Sometimes the glomeruli become swollen or inflamed, causing glomerulonephritis (glow-mare-u-low-nef-ry-tis) soon after an infection. This is called    post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) . PIGN can be caused by different kinds of germs, including bacteria and viruses. The most common type of PIGN is caused by a type of bacteria called streptococcus (strep). Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis most often affects children 1-2 weeks after a streptococcal throat infection (“ strep throat \"). Less often, it can happen 3-6 weeks after a streptococcal skin infection. Children between 5-12 years old get it most often. What are the common symptoms and lab results in a child with PIGN?\t Blood in the urine  (hematuria) is the most common symptom of PIGN. Urine can look dark like the color of tea or cola. Sometimes you can't see the blood, but it can be found when the urine is tested in the lab or looked at with a microscope at the doctor's office. Hematuria happens when the glomeruli become damaged enough to leak blood into the urine.​\t Body swelling  (edema). This can start with swelling around the eyelids, especially when the child wakes up. In some children, you can also see swelling in other parts of the body like the ankles or the belly. This is caused by fluid building up in these areas. This swelling happens because the body is holding on to water and salt, and because the kidneys are making less urine. In severe cases, a child can have problems breathing because of fluid getting into the lungs.\t High blood pressure  (hypertension). This is also caused by salt and water building up in the body and can be mild to severe. A very high blood pressure can cause problems in other organs, such as the brain or heart.\t Protein in the urine  ( proteinuria ). A urine test may find that there is protein in the urine. While the urine protein level in PIGN is usually not high enough to cause a problem, in some cases it can become high enough to cause even more body swelling. This is because so much protein was lost in urine that there's not enough of it left in the body to do its usual job of keeping fluid in the right balance throughout the body. As a result, fluid leaks into wrong parts of the body and causes swelling. \t Decreased kidney function  (acute kidney injury). Children with PIGN are often described as having acute kidney injury because the kidneys are less able to filter blood. “Acute\" means that the kidney injury happens quickly and lasts for only a short time. Acute kidney injury is usually mild in PIGN but can be more severe.     How is PIGN diagnosed? Your child's doctor will do a complete physical exam, which includes taking their blood pressure. Your child's urine and blood will also be tested.  The diagnosis is often easy to make based on the child's symptoms and results from blood and urine tests. Rarely, if symptoms get worse or the diagnosis is not certain, a kidney biopsy might be recommended.  What is the treatment for PIGN? In very mild cases, no treatment is needed. Children are often asked to eat less    salt  until the PIGN gets better and the kidneys heal. Medicine may be needed to treat the symptoms (such as high blood pressure or swelling).  A child with very high blood pressure or severe swelling may need to go into the hospital for monitoring and to get medicine by mouth or through a needle in a vein (intravenous). Severe acute kidney injury is very rare in PIGN, but when it happens, short-term dialysis treatment may be needed.    How soon do children usually recover from PIGN? Most symptoms of PIGN get better within 1-2 weeks, but small amounts of blood may still be found in the urine for many months. Your doctor may recommend a few follow-up visits. Repeat blood testing is usually needed at least once. Most children have a complete recovery of their kidney function.  Remember Talk with your pediatrician if your child has symptoms such as peeing less than usual, blood or rust-colored urine, and swelling and joint pain, especially after an infection.

        "content": "By: Darcy Weidemann, MD FAAP & Juan C. Kupferman, MD, MPH, FAAP Hydronephrosis, also called urinary tract dilation, happens when urine backs up into the kidney. This causes swelling in the kidney's drainage system. When the hydronephrosis is found during pregnancy, it is called   prenatal hydronephrosis .   Prenatal hydronephrosis is relatively common, affecting about 1 in 100 babies. In fact, it is the most common problem found on a prenatal ultrasound.  Hydronephrosis can affect just one kidney (called unilateral) or both kidneys (called bilateral). Prenatal hydronephrosis is graded on a scale that ranges from mild to moderate to severe. It depends on how much swelling there is in the kidney drainage system on the kidney ultrasound.  What causes prenatal hydronephrosis?\t Unknown (idiopathic).  In more than half of babies who are diagnosed with hydronephrosis before birth, the condition goes away on its own and the cause is never known.\t Ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction  is a blockage where the kidney meets the ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder). This leads to a buildup of urine in the kidney.\t Ureterovesical junction (UVJ) obstruction  is a blockage where the bladder meets the ureter (tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder). This leads to a buildup of urine in the kidney.\t Posterior urethral valves (PUV)  is a form of blockage of the kidney's drainage system that happens only in boys. It is caused by a blockage in the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder through the penis\t Ureterocele  is when the ureter does not develop properly and causes a small pouch or bulge into the bladder\t Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)  is when urine in the bladder flows backwards into the ureters and sometimes into the kidneys\t Ectopic ureter  is an attachment of the ureter to somewhere outside the bladder, like the urethra or vagina\t Neurogenic bladder  is when the nerves do not properly carry the message from the bladder to the brain and from the brain to the muscles of the bladder. More rare causes of hydronephrosis include  urethra atresia  (when the drainage tube from bladder did not develop properly) or  bladder neck obstruction  (a blockage that reduces or stops urine flow out of the bladder) How is hydronephrosis diagnosed? Hydronephrosis is most commonly diagnosed on a routine prenatal ultrasound. In these cases, an ultrasound is done after birth to see if hydronephrosis persists. It is important that an ultrasound is done at least 48 hours after birth. This is because an ultrasound within the first two days of life can show a falsely low level of hydronephrosis. How is the cause of hydronephrosis diagnosed? Many children have mild or no hydronephrosis on the ultrasound after birth. They may not need any more testing. Children with moderate or severe hydronephrosis after birth may need other tests. These tests, which may include a voiding cystourethrogram or nuclear medicine renal scan, can look for vesicoureteral reflux, posterior urethral valves or blockages like UPJ or UVJ obstruction.  What are the signs & symptoms of hydronephrosis? Most children with hydronephrosis have no symptoms. However, children with hydronephrosis may be at higher risk for urinary tract infections (UTIs). Symptoms of a UTI may include fever, burning with urination, cloudy urine, a strong or sudden urge to use the bathroom, back pain or vomiting.    Symptoms of UTIs  in babies may include irritability, poor feeding or fever. If a UTI is suspected, it's best to get a urine sample using a catheter to decrease the chance of contaminating the urine. When should I call the doctor? Fever (any temperature greater than 101.5° F) at any age Severe pain in the belly, side or lower back Pain with urination  Blood in the urine   Persistent irritability and poor feeding in babies  What is the treatment for hydronephrosis?  Hydronephrosis will most often get better on its own with no treatment.  Most cases of mild and moderate hydronephrosis need only periodic monitoring with kidney and bladder ultrasounds. The ultrasounds will show the degree of hydronephrosis and whether it is stable, improving or worsening. They can also monitor the growth of the kidneys over time. If a child's hydronephrosis is severe or worsens over time, medical intervention may be needed. Some children take a low dose of an   antibiotic to help prevent urinary tract infections. The decision for using antibiotics will be made depending on your child's cause of hydronephrosis, which the doctor will discuss with you. In some cases, children may need to be referred to a kidney doctor (pediatric nephrologist). Blood tests are needed sometimes to know how well the kidneys are working. Some children may need to be referred to a kidney surgeon (pediatric urologist). Sometimes, a procedure is done to repair the blockage in the kidney, or to repair the blockage in the ureter and reconnect it to the healthy portion of the kidney's drainage system. In some cases of VUR, a procedure may be done to prevent the backward flow of urine. Boys with posterior urethral valves may need surgery to remove the blockage in the urethra, which carries urine from the bladder through the penis. Some urology surgeries can be done with cystourethroscopy, a procedure performed by passing a camera into the urethra and bladder that require no incisions. But others are more traditional surgeries and can be done through one open incision, or with laparoscopic or robotic surgery (through several small incisions). What are the possible long-term effects of hydronephrosis? In some cases, hydronephrosis that is severe or left untreated can cause urinary tract infections, kidney scarring, and loss of kidney function that may cause long-term problems. However, most children with hydronephrosis lead normal lives. Most cases resolve within a child's first few years, often without need for surgery. Even children with hydronephrosis that does not resolve quickly typically do not have kidney damage and have no long-term problems.

        "content": "Children usually need to pass urine more often than adults because their bladders are smaller and they tend to drink more fluids relative to their size. In addition, young children may feel the need to pass urine more urgently because it takes a long time—several years—to develop mature control of the muscles that open and close the bladder. If a child has pain on urination, a  urinary tract infection (UTI)  is the most likely reason, but several other conditions can also cause pain. Call Your Pediatrician Right Away If Your Child: Cannot pass urine Is passing bloody urine Has a swelling in the abdomen and difficulty urinating Has pain on urination Is urinating with unusual frequency Is having daytime or nighttime wetting after achieving a pattern of dryness Warning! Some children who have pain from recurrent UTIs are in the habit of passing urine infrequently. They may also be severely  constipated . Train your child to respond promptly when she feels the urge to use the bathroom. Preventing UTIs Pain on urination is most often caused by infection. Girls are particularly susceptible to UTIs, because their urethras are very short and germs from the bowel can easily pass along this route to the bladder. To reduce the risk of infection, girls should always wipe from front to back after bowel movements. A popular home remedy for infections is drinking cranberry or blueberry juice. Studies show that these fruits contain substances that make the urine more acidic and stop bacteria from growing. However, drinking plenty of plain water to flush out the bladder may be just as effective.  Other helpful measures include the following: Wear cotton underpants and avoid very tight-fitting jeans and other pants. Avoid bubble baths, perfumed soaps, and other substances that can irritate the genitals and urethra. After swimming, change into dry clothes instead of sitting around in a wet suit. Avoid foods and beverages that can cause bladder irritation. Common offenders include colas and other caffeinated drinks, chocolate, and some spices. Common Concerns from Parents \"My toilet-trained child is urinating often or with greater urgency. She has started wetting her bed or underclothes after a long dry period. She is having abdominal pain. Her urine smells bad. She has blood in her urine. She has pain or burning on urination.\" Possible cause:  UTI What parents should do:  Call your pediatrician. If a bacterial infection is present, it must be treated promptly to prevent complications. If the infection is caused by a virus,  antibiotics won't help , but the infection should clear up by itself in about 4 days. In the meantime, your pediatrician will recommend ways to keep your child comfortable. \"My baby's urine has an unpleasant smell. She is feverish and fretful.\" Possible cause:  UTI What parents should do:  Call your pediatrician, who will examine your baby, perform  diagnostic tests including a urine culture , and prescribe appropriate treatment.",

        "content": "​​Proteinuria means there is too much protein in the urine. Healthy kidneys allow only a very small amount of protein to pass from the blood into the urine.    Proteinuria may suggest that the kidneys are sick.  Measuring protein in the urine is one way to check on the health of the kidneys. Fortunately, many children have only temporary proteinuria and do not have a kidney disease. Testing for proteinuria  A urinalysis is the easiest way to test for proteinuria. A urinalysis is done by dipping a chemically treated paper strip into a urine sample. If the paper strip changes to a certain color, that means there's protein in the urine. Then, other tests can be used to find the exact amount of protein. This can be done by sending a urine sample to a lab. Harmless types of proteinuria  Many children with proteinuria do not have kidney disease. Orthostatic proteinuria and temporary proteinuria, for example, are common causes of proteinuria in children    without  kidney disease. Orthostatic proteinuria   \"Orthostatic\" is the medical term for \"upright\" (standing). Children with orthostatic proteinuria spill protein into the urine only when they are standing up, but not while they are laying down.  A child is diagnosed with orthostatic proteinuria when their daytime urine has increased ed levels of protein, but their first morning urine sample is normal. The first morning urine sample is normal because at night, while the child is laying down and sleeping, their kidneys do not leak too much protein into the urine. Children who have orthostatic proteinuria do not have kidney disease and do not need any treatment or follow-up. This kind of proteinuria is a variation of normal. Temporary proteinuria Some children may have increased protein in the urine during times of illness, fever, exercise or other kinds of physical stress. This type of proteinuria is also a variation of normal. It is important to recheck the amount of protein in the urine of these children after they are well or before exercise to make sure that proteinuria is not still present.  Proteinuria and kidney disease Proteinuria that is not orthostatic or temporary may occur in children with kidney disease. Children with kidney disease may also have high blood pressure or blood in the urine. Severe proteinuria may cause swelling of the face, stomach or legs. Swelling due to proteinuria happens in a kidney problem called  nephrotic syndrome​ . Children with proteinuria may have other symptoms such as rash or joint pain due to the disease causing the proteinuria. A    pediatric nephrologist​  is a doctor who cares for children with kidney disease and evaluates and treats children with proteinuria. Children with proteinuria often need blood tests to check on the health of their kidneys and to look for the cause of the kidney disease.  The pediatric nephrologist may need to do a kidney biopsy to determine the cause of the proteinuria and the best way to treat your child. A kidney biopsy uses a needle to take a tiny sample of kidney tissue. It is then examined under a microscope. The pediatric nephrologist often uses medications to treat children with kidney disease causing proteinuria. Changing the protein in your child's diet is not necessary and is almost never recommended.  More information HealthyChildren.org:    Genitals and Urinary Tract",

        "content": "By age 5, about 8% of girls and 1-2% of boys have had at least one urinary tract infection (UTI). Most children who have one UTI will not have another. Anatomic factors, toileting habits,  constipation , and other factors may contribute to an elevated risk of reinfection. If your child develops recurrent UTIs— two, three or more infections —he or she may be referred to a  pediatric urologist  who will look for potential causes. Testing for UTIs Every child is different, and UTI symptoms vary depending on the child's age. In babies, fever, fussiness, or tiredness may be the only signs of UTI. Older children may have fever, burning, frequent urination, lower abdominal pain, or back pain.  Symptoms alone are not enough to diagnose a UTI . Most children who develop these symptoms have a different cause for them, such as a virus.   Pediatricians check for bacteria in the urine with a culture test. The test must be properly collected (usually with a catheter) to produce reliable results. A child with bacteria in the urine but no symptoms does not have a UTI; he or she may have a condition called  asymptomatic bacteriuria , which usually requires no treatment.    To be diagnosed with a UTI, a child must have symptoms plus bacteria in the urine on a properly-collected culture. If a UTI is associated with high fever, it usually suggests an infection involving one or both kidneys.     Causes of Recurrent UTIs  Recurrent UTIs are taken seriously, because the risk of health problems increases with each subsequent infection. Here are some of the potential causes: Bladder & Bowel Problems Many children hold urine too long, don't relax fully when urinating , or don't empty their bladder completely. Regular urination helps flush away bacteria; holding urine helps bacteria to grow. A child who doesn't drink enough fluid may not make enough urine to flush away bacteria. This often goes hand in hand with bowel dysfunction such as constipation. These problems increase the risk of UTI. Sometimes, your pediatrician will request a voiding diary (a recording of daily urination and bowel movements) to help understand your child's bathroom habits.  Urinary Tract Abnormalities Children may have correctable bladder or kidney problems that contribute to UTIs including partial blockages, dilated segments, stones, or elevated bladder pressures. Your pediatrician may order an ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder to look for these issues. Depending on the ultrasound result, he or she may recommend more specialized tests. Urine Reflux Some children have backflow of urine from the bladder to kidneys, a congenital (present at birth) condition that can contribute to kidney infections. Urine reflux, together with infections, poses a threat to kidney health. If it's infected with bacteria, it can lead to pyelonephritis (a urinary tract infection involving the kidney). Pediatric urologists may request a special x-ray called a  voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG)  to look for this condition. Sometimes reflux improves, or resolves altogether, as children grow up.  Treatment for Recurrent UTIs Every child's UTI treatment is individualized and based on the underlying cause of his or her UTI. To address bladder and bowel problems, for example, your pediatrician may recommend constipation treatment and scheduled bathroom trips. Preventative antibiotics are helpful in  some  patients with recurrent UTIs and urine reflux. Sometimes, urinary tract abnormalities are addressed with surgery. In many children with recurrent UTIs, no treatment is needed―only careful monitoring.  What are the long-term concerns for children with recurrent UTIs? Most children who have multiple UTIs do not develop long-term health problems. However, repeated infections can cause kidney damage, or scarring. Not all children who have infections develop kidney scars. Sometimes, specialized scans are recommended to look for kidney scarring in children with a history of multiple UTIs. In a small percentage of cases, patients may develop  chronic kidney disease  or  high blood pressure . Pediatric urologists do their best to help prevent these issues in children. Children who have a history of recurrent UTIs should have blood pressure checks and urine tests annually. Will my child need preventative antibiotics? Preventative  antibiotics can help reduce recurrent UTIs in  some  children. Children with bladder and bowel dysfunction, severe urine reflux, or urinary tract abnormalities may benefit the most. In children with a lower risk of additional infections, antibiotics may not be best, as they can reduce healthy bacteria and increase the risk that a future infection might be caused by a resistant strain.  Remember: Recurrent UTIs are common in children, and there are many effective treatments available. Some simple things you can do to help prevent UTIs in your child include drinking lots of fluids, encouraging frequent urination, preventing constipation, keeping the genital area clean, wearing cotton underwear, and wiping from front to back after a bowel movement or urination.

        "content": "​​​Testicular pain in teens could be a sign of testicula​r torsion. The most important thing to know about testicular torsion is that it is an      emergency  that must be treated immediately. But, it can be difficult for teenage boys to talk about their testicles or tell a parent if they are having pain. Boys need to know that any genital pain is serious and should not be ignored. Ignoring testicle pain for too long or simply hoping it goes away can result in severe damage to the testicle and even its removal. Time is critical! \t If your son has pain in his testes, take him to the emergency room right away.  The time from the start of symptoms until treatment is the most important factor in being able to save the testicle. The longer someone waits to seek treatment, the greater the risk of permanent injury.   If treated within 6 hours of the start of pain         à  over 90% chance of saving the testicle. If treated after 24 hours of pain         à ​ less than 10% chance of saving the testicle.  This includes the time it takes to get to a hospital, get evaluated, and get treated.   What is Testicular Torsion? Testicular torsion most often occurs in teenage boys and is the most common      pediatric emergency of the genitourinary tract .  Boys usually have two testicles sitting in the scrotum, and each one hangs from a cord – the spermatic cord. The cord carries important structures such as blood vessels, which give the testicle oxygen. If the cord were to twist, the testicle would lose its blood supply and oxygen.  The pain is excruciating, but somehow many boys or their parents try to ignore it.  That denial comes at a cost. If the torsion isn't corrected quickly, the testicle may die. 30-40% of cases of testicular torsion results in loss of the testicle.  What are Symptoms of Testicular Torsion? The symptoms of testicular torsion may involve one or both of the testes. The following are the most common symptoms of testicular torsion. However, each child may experience      symptoms  differently.  Symptoms may include: Pain in the scrotum (Usually on one side, sudden, and severe)  Swollen, red, tender scrotum Enlarged testicle\t Abdominal pain Nausea or vomiting Not all severe scrotal pain is torsion, but since the cause of pain isn't known until a boy is evaluated, all cases of severe scrotal pain need to be treated as an emergency. Who is At Risk for Testicular Torsion?\t Age:  It most commonly occurs in teenage boys, shortly         after puberty , however it can occur in younger children. It is uncommon over the age of 25.\t Family history:  Having a relative who had torsion increases the risk of torsion, (but this is not always known).  \t Setting:  Torsion can occur at any time (even when asleep). Sometimes, torsions happen from a         sports injury . Wearing a cup for any contact or high-impact sport may help prevent torsion or other injuries to the testicle. How is Testicular Torsion Diagnosed?  Physical examination  Scrotal Doppler ultrasound (a wand-like instrument  placed on the scrotum to assess blood flow to the testicles) Some         urologists  will take a patient with typical symptoms of torsion directly to the operating room. How is Testicular Torsion Treated? Immediate surgery to untwist the testicle is required to potentially save the testicle. After untwisting, the testicle is secured in the proper position. If the torsion has caused too much damage, the testicle may need to be removed. It may also be necessary to secure the other testicle to prevent it from twisting. Some      urologists  may untwist the testicle with a bedside maneuver before surgery, but surgery is still required. Can Testicular Torsion Fix Itself? Occasionally, a testicle can twist and untwist. This is called      intermittent torsion . In intermittent torsion, severe pain may suddenly appear and then just as suddenly get better.  This type of pain still needs to be evaluated by a healthcare professional for several reasons: Most torsions don't improve on their own. Waiting for the testicle to untwist increases the risk of losing a testicle. Even after untwisting, the testicle is at risk for a future episode of torsion. Sometimes the untwisting is not complete and there is less blood reaching the testicle, which causes damage even though the pain is much better.   Twisting and untwisting can still injure the testicle, even if it doesn't cause loss of the testicle. When one side has torsion, the other testicle is at higher risk for torsion. Both sides need to be evaluated and possibly treated.\t Not all scrotal pain is a torsion. Pain that comes and goes may be due to other causes, which also need to be evaluated. What if a Testicle Needs to Be Removed? The testicle is removed (orchiectomy) if the torsion is severe, the blood supply is lost, and the tissue in the testicle dies. Fortunately, only one testicle is generally needed to carry out the functions of a testicle:  Making hormones (testosterone)  Contributing to pregnancy  So, even if someone loses a testicle to torsion, they are still usually able to carry out these functions. However, in some rare cases, testicular torsion can increase the risk for infertility.  Testicular Implants  While there is nothing to be ashamed about in losing a testicle, loss of a testicle can be emotionally difficult for some boys. At a later time, if you and your son desire a more cosmetic appearance, testicular implants exist that can be placed surgically. What Should Parents of Teen Boys Keep in Mind?  While it may be awkward to discuss genital anatomy with your preteen and teenage son, they need to know that any pain in their genitals is an emergency.  Talk to your son about the risks of keeping severe scrotal pain a secret. Reassure him that there is nothing to be embarrassed about. Encourage him to tell you or an adult if they are having sudden, severe scrotal pain. This is the best way to prevent loss of a testicle.

        "content": "By: Hatim Thaker, MD, FAAP  Before birth, a baby boy's testes (testicles) develop inside the abdomen. Closer to delivery, these organs travel through a canal in the groin. When all goes as it should, the testicles then fall into place in the scrotum, the bag of skin beneath the penis. In some boys, especially those who are born  premature , one or both testicles do not make it down to the scrotum before birth. This is known as cryptorchidism, more commonly called undescended testicles. For babies born with this condition, the testicles sometimes descend on their own—usually by  6 months of age . In other cases, treatment or surgery is needed. Are undescended testicles common in children? Undescended testicles is the most common genital abnormality found at birth. About 1-3% of full-term boys have the condition at birth. But the rate is much higher in boys born preterm. About 30% of boys with a low birthweight (less than 5 pounds, 4 ounces) are born with undescended testicles. Those with a very low birthweight (less than 3 pounds, 4 ounces) have a near 100% chance of being born with undescended testicles.  What causes undescended testicles?  Nobody is certain what causes undescended testicles. Premature birth plays a role, but the condition may also be genetic. There is a 7.5% chance that a brother of a boy with undescended testicles will have the same condition. The odds rise to 25% if the brother is an identical twin.  What are symptoms of undescended testicles? Typically, boys with undescended testicles have no symptoms of pain or discomfort. The scrotum may appear small and underdeveloped. If only one testicle is undescended, the scrotum may look asymmetrical (full on one side, empty on the other). You may also notice that the testicles are sometimes in the scrotum and at other times absent (for example, when he is cold or excited). This is a condition known as retractile testicles.  Are there different types of undescended testicles? Among boys with undescended testicles, there are several different forms of the condition: Congenital:  A testicle that never descended into the scrotum. This is diagnosed at birth. Acquired:  When the testicle was within the scrotum at birth, but are later is abnormally positioned testicle.  Vanishing testicle:  When a testicle is completely absent--neither in the scrotum or the abdomen—it is called a vanishing testicle. Having a single testicle typically causes no hormonal or fertility problems.  Retractile testicle:  With this condition, a testicle is truly located in the scrotum but slips up into an abnormal position (such as the groin). This is typically caused by a muscle reflex. Cold temperatures, for example, can prompt this normal reflex and cause the testicle to temporarily disappear. A retractile testicle often does not require surgical treatment. How are undescended testicles diagnosed? Undescended testicles are diagnosed through physical examination. At every well-child visit, the doctor will do a genital examination to check the location of the testicles. Does my child need an ultrasound to locate their testicle? Usually not. Most often, an undescended testicle diagnosis can be confirmed with a careful physical exam by your child's doctor. Ultrasound typically is not necessary, even in situations where the testicle cannot be felt in the groin. In fact, an ultrasound may give inaccurate results on the location or presence/absence of a testicle.  Only in very rare cases is ultrasound helpful, such as before surgery for a previously repaired undescended testicle.  How are undescended testicles treated? If your child's testicle has not come down into the scrotum on its own by 6 months of age, they will likely need treatment. It is relatively rare for undescended testicles to fall into proper position after 6 months of age. So, there is usually little value to waiting. In the past, undescended testicles were treated with hormone injections; however, this is no longer recommended.  Instead, the current approach to treatment involves surgery to relocate the testicle into the scrotum. This surgical procedure is called an  orchiopexy . It may need to be performed in a two-stage manner depending on the location of the testicle.  The goals of this surgery include:  Relocate the testicle   into a natural position in the scrotum. Reduce the risk of potential hormone and fertility problems. Reduce the risk of testicular cancer, which is slightly raised if testicles are undescended. Complications of orchiopexy are very rare. It can be performed as an outpatient procedure.  When should my child have the surgery to correct an undescended testicle? Since the chances of the testicle coming down on its own is slim after 6 months old, your child should be referred for treatment once they've reached that age. Waiting beyond 2-3 years may hinder the testicle's ability to grow and function normally. Ideally, orchiopexy should be done within the first 18 months of life.  As with any surgical procedure, the risks of  anesthesia  should be carefully considered for your child's specific situation.  For teenagers with an undescended testicle that has never been fixed, your specialist may suggest biopsy of the testicle to look for cancerous cells.  What if the testicle is twisted? In some cases, the undescended testicle may be  twisted , in a condition called testicular torsion. As a result, its blood supply may be stopped, causing pain in the inguinal (groin) or scrotal area. If this situation is not corrected promptly, the testicle can be damaged severely and permanently. If your child has an undescended testicle and complains of pain in the groin or scrotal area, call your pediatrician or go to a hospital emergency department immediately. Who is involved in the medical care for a child with undescended testicles? Pediatricians and pediatric urologists work together to care for boys with undescended testicle.

        "content": "What is a ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction? Our kidneys work to filter waste out of our blood and make urine, which then drains into the bladder through tubes called ureters. When a ureter becomes blocked near the kidney, urine can build up inside the kidney and cause swelling (hydronephrosis).  About 1 in 1,000 children are born with a blocked UPJ. Over time, the blockage can prevent the kidney from doing its job and cause damage. How do I know if my child has a UPJ obstruction? Prenatal  ultrasound  exams sometimes can show a UPJ blockage before birth. In older children and adolescents, the blockage is found after the child gets a  urinary tract infection . Other signs and symptoms of UPJ obstruction can include  abdominal pain  or soreness in their lower  back  and side. The pain may be vague, and the child may also get an upset stomach, nausea and vomiting. How is a UPJ diagnosed? Ultrasound is the main imaging study used to diagnose ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction. But sometimes, different imagining tests like a computed tomography ( CT) scan  or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) done for other reasons reveal the blockage. A nuclear kidney scan (and sometimes a specific type of MRI) can show the doctor how well the kidney is functioning and how big the blockage is. In certain cases, a voiding cystourethrogram test is done to make sure that the swelling is not being caused by another condition called  vesicoureteral reflux , a backwards flow of urine. Why causes a UPJ? When infants have a UPJ blockage, most often it's because they have an especially narrow ureter where it connects to the kidney. Children and adolescents may have the same situation but are more likely to have a blood vessel crossing the ureter that causes the blockage. How is UPJ treated? If a baby is born with a UPJ, doctors may monitor the blockage and any swelling with ultrasound exams. Sometimes, the condition will improve on its own as infants and young children outgrow it. However, if the blockage gets worse or if you child gets repeated infections, surgical repair of the UPJ (pyeloplasty) will be needed. But it is important to have close follow-up with your  pediatric urologist , even if your child does not have any symptoms.  What if my child needs pyeloplasty surgery? UPJ surgery involves removing the blocked or narrowed area of the ureter and rerouting it to let urine to travel through freely. There are different surgical techniques used for pyeloplasty, and the decision about which type is best for your child is best made with your pediatric urologist. Because every child is different, the type of surgery should be individualized. Surgery usually involves an overnight stay in the hospital. Recovery may take one to two weeks, but full recovery is to be expected after a month.

        "content": "Yeast infections are caused by the fungus  Candida albicans,  one of many fungi that reside harmlessly in the vagina, mouth, throat and skin. The slightly acidic chemical content of the vagina controls the balance between the bacteria and yeast that reside in the normal vagina. If the fragile balance between  acidity  and  alkalinity  is altered, the amount of yeast grows to the extent that a Candida infection (known as  candidiasis ) occurs. A similarly uneasy truce exists between “friendly” bacteria ( lactobacilli ) and “unfriendly” bacteria ( anaerobes ). In bacterial vaginosis, the anaerobes multiply at a rapid pace until they’ve all but displaced many of the lactobacilli. As in candidiasis, the vaginal ecosystem changes from acidic to alkaline. “Nobody is absolutely sure what causes the bacterial overgrowth,” says Dr. Meg Fisher, a pediatrician at St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children, in Philadelphia. Interestingly, although bacterial vaginosis is not transmitted via intercourse, sexually active women have a higher rate of infection—and higher still if they’ve been intimate with multiple partners.  Physical examination, including pelvic exam, and thorough medical history, plus one or more of the following procedures: Microscopic laboratory analysis of vaginal fluid (your pediatrician may refer to these tests as  wet preparation  and  KOH preparation ) to rule out infection.  \t  \t How Vaginal Infections are Treated\t Drug therapy:  Yeast infections are managed with  antifungal  agents suchas butoconazole, clotrimazole, miconazole and tioconazole, which come in the form of creams, ointments and suppositories.

        "content": "As part of your periodic parent-son chats about sex and sexual development, stress that any sort of genital pain or swelling is cause for concern and should be brought to the immediate attention of Mom, Dad or the pediatrician. One source of scrotal swelling is a  varicocele  within the  scrotum.  Like all veins, the veins in the spermatic cord have pairs of flipper like valves interspersed along the inner walls. Their job: to keep blood moving in one direction, toward the heart. Any time the circulation starts to flow backward, the flaps of the valves swing shut.\t Varicocele is set in motion when one or more valves fail to close properly. As a result, stagnant blood builds up in the vessel until the wall becomes swollen. The distended scrotal sac is said to resemble a “bag of worms”: a reference to the bulging vessels inside. A varicocele most often develops on the left side of the scrotum.\t Symptoms That Suggest Varicocele May Include:\t Most varicoceles are painless and do not cause symptoms. Occasionally one may experience dull, persistent ache or sensation of heaviness in the scrotum—often most noticeable after physical exercise. There may be a reduction in testicular size ( atrophy ).\t How Varicocele is Diagnosed\t The condition is diagnosed through physical examination and thorough medical history, including probing or palpating the area with the fingers. No radiographic studies are needed unless there is concern about obstruction as a cause. An ultrasound is done if the examiner feels the testicle on the affected side is too small. The varicocele may be apparent when standing.\t How Varicocele is Managed\t Most pubertal or prepubertal varicoceles do not need to be treated. However, if the varicocele is associated with pain during physical exercise, repair may be needed. Even if there is no pain, the potential for problems of infertility, which has been noted in men with a varicocele, may cause some doctors to suggest surgical repair. There is no absolute test or study that will predetermine which child is at risk for infertility based on his varicocele. Some physicians would encourage repairing a varicocele if there is a noticeable size discrepancy between the two testicles. Therefore, it is important to closely monitor the growth and development of both testicles as a child progresses through puberty. When surgical correction has been recommended, the procedure can be performed in an outpatient setting. Recovery takes about one week; however, it will be another five weeks, on average, before full recovery can be expected.",

        "content": "About 1-3% of all infants and children have a condition called vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), which means some of their urine flows in the wrong direction after entering the bladder.  Some of the urine flows back up toward the kidneys and can increase the chance of developing a  urinary tract infection (UTI ).  ​ UTIs that reach the kidneys can cause health problems. That's why it's important to diagnose and monitor VUR early and treat it if needed. What causes VUR in children? Most children who have VUR are born with it, and doctors aren't sure of the cause. It appears to happen by chance. Researchers are studying inherited or genetic factors (conditions the children are born with) that may be the cause.  A child's urinary tract is usually a one-way street  (see pictures below).  The urine flows down from each kidney through tubes called ureters. The ureters enter the bladder through a tunnel of bladder muscle that creates special one-way valves to prevent urine from going back up into the kidneys. The urine in the bladder travels out of the body through another tube called the urethra.  In children with VUR, the tunnel in the bladder for one or both ureters may be too short, making the valve \"leaky.\"  VUR can also happen as a result of the bladder not emptying normally. This is a less common cause of VUR.\t \t  What are the signs and symptoms of VUR? VUR doesn't usually cause symptoms until a child develops a UTI.  UTIs can be in the bladder or the kidney. \t Bladder UTI:  These are common and annoying, but bladder infections are usually not harmful to long-term health.   Symptoms can include frequent urination or pain with urination.\t Kidney UTIs  : VUR can increase the risk of a kidney UTI  (also called pyelonephritis).  This is because urine that carries germs can go backwards into the kidney.   A kidney UTI can make a child very sick. The child may have high fever, chills and back pain. Kidney UTIs can scar the kidneys. In rare cases, the scarring may cause high blood pressure or reduced kidney function. VUR may also be suspected if a child has hydronephrosis, kidney swelling caused by the build-up of fluid. This can be seen on a kidney ultrasound.  Should my child be tested for VUR?  VUR is diagnosed by a test called a     \t voiding cysto-urethrogram (VCUG).  A VCUG is usually done if: a child has had one UTI with fever and a kidney ultrasound shows a problem. an infant or young child under 2 years who has had 2 or more UTIs with fever. What to expect during a VCUG test:  A thin plastic tube called a catheter is placed into the urethra, and the bladder is filled with a special fluid that can be seen by x-ray. The test is not painful, but the child may experience some stress and short-term discomfort from putting in the bladder catheter. X-rays are taken as the bladder fills up. VUR is diagnosed if the liquid goes the wrong way up a ureter into a kidney.  What other tests may be done in a child with VUR?\t Ultrasound:  This test uses sound waves to create an image of a child's kidneys and bladder. It is recommended for all infants and toddlers after their first UTI with a fever. \t Dimercaptosuccinic Acid (DMSA) Scan:  A DMSA scan can give more detail about whether kidneys have developed scars as a result of kidney UTIs. A doctor may order it if a child has had many UTIs with fever. \t Blood test:  Creatinine measures kidney function.  The creatinine level may be too high in a child with damaged kidneys.  \t Blood pressure:  Blood pressure should be checked at least once a year. Children with kidney problems are at higher risk for high blood pressure. How is VUR graded? VUR is graded between 1 (mild) to 5 (worst). The grade is based on how far the urine backs up and how wide the ureter is. Children who have lower grades of VUR (1-2) found early in childhood have a good chance of outgrowing it within 1 to 5 years.\t \t  What kinds of doctors care for children with VUR?  Pediatric specialists who care for children with VUR include:\t Pediatric nephrologist s: Kidney experts who treat children with kidney problems. \t Pediatric urologists : Kidney experts who do surgery on the genital and urinary tracts (kidney, ureters, bladder) of children. How is VUR treated?  Treatment for VUR is based on a child's age, the grade of their VUR, and whether it's causing any problems, such as a lot of UTIs. In many cases, VUR will get better on its own with age.  Treatment approaches include:\t Observation:  Children with lower grades of VUR may be safely watched under their doctors' care.  This usually involves regular follow-up appointments. It may include imaging tests to make sure the kidneys are growing normally. Children with VUR should have their urine tested for infection any time they develop a fever and there is no other reason for the fever, like a cold. \t Preventative antibiotics (prophylaxis):  Some children are given a low dose of an            antibiotic  every day to decrease the risk of developing a UTI while waiting to see if they outgrow the VUR. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends preventative antibiotics mostly for children with higher grades of VUR (grades 3-5).\t Surgery:  If VUR is severe and does not get better, or if there are repeated kidney UTIs with fever, a child may benefit from surgery that fixes the leaky valve between the bladder and the ureter. Procedures include:\t Ureteral reimplantation:  The connection between the ureter and bladder is corrected so that urine flows only in one direction. \t Endoscopic injection:  A substance is injected into the area where the ureter meets the bladder to prevent backward flow of urine.  These procedures are common, generally very safe, and have excellent long-term success.  What else can parents of children with VUR do?  Continue to help your child with healthy bladder and bowel habits. All potty-trained children with VUR need to work on this to help  prevent UTIs . Avoid constipation.  Most children get      constipated . This is common around the age of potty training when they are learning to hold their bowels. Constipation makes it harder to empty the bladder and increases the risk of a UTI. It is important to avoid or treat constipation.   Discourage \"holding it.\"  Drinking enough water and eating a high- fiber  diet may prevent or treat constipation. Some children may need a gentle daily laxative. Children should have a soft bowel movement every day.\t It is also important that children completely empty their bladder every 2-3 hours when they are awake. Children should avoid holding their urine for long periods.  This helps keep the bladder clean and prevents UTIs.  Know the early signs of a UTI:  Fever over 100.4 degrees  Pain or burning with urination Frequent urination Lower belly or side pain Vomiting  Foul-smelling urine that does not get better after drinking more fluids If your child has any of these symptoms, call your pediatrician. Based on test results, your pediatrician will decide whether your child needs to start treatment with an antibiotic either at home or in the hospital. Remember: Many children grow out of VUR over time, often by age 5.  Finding VUR early and monitoring it closely with your child's doctors--and getting treatment if needed--will help avoid any lasting problems.

        "content": "​​​​By: Julie Cheng, MD, MAE, FAAP Babies born with hypospadias have differences in the structure of the penis.  The opening where urine exits the body (the meatus) is not at the tip or head (glans) of the penis, as usual. Instead,  it is located  somewhere along the underside of the penis. There may also be other differences.  Here are answers to some common questions parents may have about hypospadias. How common is hypospadias? Hypospadias is a fairly common congenital (present at birth) condition of the penis. It has been reported to occur in up to 1-in-125 male births.  What causes hypospadias? Hypospadias occurs when the urethra (the duct that lets urine flow from the bladder to outside the body) does not completely wrap into a tube when the fetus is developing. This results in an opening on the underside of the penis.  No specific causes of hypospadias have been identified. However, the condition can occur with genetic, hormonal or environmental factors affecting fetal growth and development. Hypospadias can sometimes be linked to an  undescended testicle  or other congenital conditions, but most children with hypospadias do not have any other differences in development. What are other differences children with hypospadias may have? With hypospadias, there may be less foreskin on the underside of the penis. In addition, children with hypospadias may have \"chordee,\" a downward bend or curve in the penis.  It is more noticeable with erections and may affect future sexual function.    What are the symptoms of hypospadias? Urine can dribble, spray or come out in a different direction (either to the side or downward) instead of coming out as a straight stream. This can sometimes affect the ability to pee standing up.  How is hypospadias diagnosed? Hypospadias is diagnosed with a physical exam after birth. Your pediatrician, pediatric urologist or pediatric surgeon will check the foreskin, location of the meatus, and any downward bend in the penis. Are there different types of hypospadias? You may hear additional terms such as \"distal\" or \"proximal\" to describe the  location  of the meatus. ​ ​\"Distal\" means the meatus is closer to the tip of the penis, and \"proximal\" means the meatus is farther from the tip of the penis and closer to the body. How is hypospadias managed & treated? If hypospadias is suspected or detected, your pediatrician may advise against circumcision until your child can be evaluated by a  pediatric urologist  or  pediatric surgeon . Circumcision can make future surgical repair more difficult.  Hypospadias surgery is preferably done starting at 6 months of age. This is when the risk of anesthesia is low, but a child has not started walking or  potty training  yet. In some more severe cases, more than one operation may be needed. What is the goal of surgery for hypospadias? The goal of surgical treatment is for a child to have a straight penis with the meatus located on the head of the penis. This can help with peeing in the standing position and future sexual function.

        "content": "​Yeast infections in the vagina and surrounding area are common in girls and women. In fact, it’s estimated that about 75 percent of all females will get a yeast infection at some point. The infection usually isn’t serious, but can be bothersome. Symptoms often include itching, burning, and a clumpy white discharge.  What Causes Yeast Infections? Yeast infections may arise when the balance of microscopic organisms that normally co-exist in the body become unbalanced. Some possible causes for this include:  Antibiotics . Yeast infections may develop after taking  antibiotics . Antibiotics are prescription medicines used to fight harmful bacteria that can make a child sick. Antibiotics may also kill some of the body’s “good” bacteria, such as  Lactobacillus  acidophilus , that usually keep the  Candida  in balance.   Hormones . Changing hormone levels that begin during  puberty  can lead to yeast infections. Older girls are more likely to get a yeast infection right before their periods, for example.  Some birth control medications can also increase infections, with  Candida  growth tied to higher estrogen levels. Underlying Conditions . Poorly controlled  diabetes  can make a child more likely to develop yeast infections, since higher blood sugar levels may promote  Candida  growth.  Immune Response . A weakened immune system caused by other illnesses or certain medications can make it difficult to fight off  Candida  that’s overgrowing. Treatment Yeast is actually a  fungus , so your pediatrician can prescribe topical anti-fungal creams, ointments or suppositories to clear up an infection.  For yeast infections that return frequently, the pediatrician may prescribe oral medications.  Can Yeast Infections Be Dangerous? Yeast infections usually aren’t dangerous unless  Candida  gets into the bloodstream and spreads to other parts of the body. Bloodstream infections are most common in newborns, especially low-birthweight babies, who can acquire the infection from their mothers before or during birth. Children with medical conditions who receive treatments involving catheters, or whose immune systems are weakened by illnesses or certain medications, also are at higher risk. If candidiasis has spread through the blood to other parts of the body, your pediatrician will usually recommend treatment with an intravenous (IV) medication.  Prevention Wise Antibiotic Use .  It may be difficult to prevent all yeast infections, especially when caused by antibiotics, which your child may need for common bacterial ailments such as  ear infections  and  strep throat . But make sure all antibiotics are taken only as prescribed. Your pediatrician or pharmacist may recommend taking probiotics supplements to rebuild beneficial bacteria in the body such as  Lactobacillus acidophilus , which help keep  Candida  in balance. Focus on Health .  Make sure your child eats a nutritious diet, gets enough  sleep , and knows how to manage  stress . These and other  healthy habits  can help keep the immune system strong so it can fight off  Candida  overgrowth and other infections. See your pediatrician regularly to stay on top of routine health issues and conditions such as diabetes, which can contribute to yeast infections if not well controlled. Stay Clean and Dry . Because yeast thrives in moist conditions, it may help to wear underwear made of cotton or other breathable fabric. Avoid materials like nylon that can trap heat and moisture, and make sure clothing isn’t too tight. Teach younger children who are  potty training  to wipe from front to back to avoid spreading microbes from the intestinal track to the vaginal area.  Other considerations . Teens using an antifungal cream, ointment or suppository who are sexually active should not have sex until the infection is completely gone.  Topical medications can weaken condoms and diaphragms. Also, while yeast infections are not considered a sexually transmitted disease, the infection can be spread during sexual activity. Douching also should be avoided, because it can affect the balance of beneficial bacteria in the vagina that helps keep yeast from taking over. Remember If you notice your child scratching a lot, talk to your pediatrician before surrounding skin becomes raw and open to bacterial infections. Be sure to mention if yeast infections are frequent so underlying medical conditions can be ruled out.

        "content": "Both boys and girls have breast tissue. Normal breast development first appears shortly after birth, and then again at the beginning of      puberty . The timing of breast development varies greatly from one person to another and in some girls may not occur until well into the teenage years. \t Here's an overview of some of the main breast abnormalities that can occur in children.    Even Infants Have Breast Tissue!  Baby girls and boys will have a small breast bud that can be felt for a few weeks after they are born. These buds of tissue will become the breast tissue in the adult. In early infancy, they can be prominent because of the effects of the mother's estrogen. As the estrogen levels decrease, so does the prominence.  Nipple discharge in infants Some babies will have discharge from and redness and swelling around the nipples and most times this will resolve spontaneously. Nipple discharge in an infant is      not  a reason to stop breastfeeding. Bring up any concerns with your child's doctor.  Extra Nipples One of the most common breast abnormalities is extra nipples (also called supernumerary nipples) commonly found in the armpits or on the abdomen in both boys and girls. This extra tissue is called      polythelia . If it is bothersome, it can be removed – typically with numbing medicine in the doctor's office at an age when the child wants to have it done. Enlarged Breasts in Boys \t Gynecomastia  is the presence of enough breast tissue in a male to appear like a breast mound is developing. Gynecomastia can range from prominent breast bud tissue that does not go away to a feminized breast with a mound and rounded nipple. Half of all teenage boys will have tender, prominent tissue in the nipple area during puberty. In most cases this tissue will go down in size over 2-3 years. If it does not, and the boy is otherwise healthy, consideration can be given to removing the tissue surgically. It is important to note that some substance abuse, including      marijuana use , can aggravate the condition. It is not uncommon for teen boys with this abnormality to become self-conscious or      bullied . Although breast growth in boys is often      hereditary , parents should seek medical attention to look for any hormonal or endocrine imbalance.  Unusually Large Breasts in Girls \t Macromastia  is the word to describe girls' breasts that are disproportionately large compared to the rest of their body. Large breasts can cause a teen girl not only emotional distress but also physical distress. For example, large breasts can be associated with upper back pain, tingling in the arms, and skin irritation. Socially they can be burdensome as teenagers, and they can restrict athletic participation. Initially, management is with physical therapy, skin care, proper bra fitting, and pain medicine as needed.  Breast reduction surgeries  When breast size causes other problems or interferes with activities, surgery can be considered. Typically, this is two to three years after a girl's menstrual cycles have begun and after shoe size stops changing.      Reduction mammoplasty surgeries , as they are called, are typically done as outpatients under general anesthesia. Activities are limited for four to six weeks, but usually girls are back at school by the next week. Surgery of this type may or may not be covered by medical insurance, depending on symptoms, duration, response to physical therapy,      body-mass index (BMI) , and the amount of tissue that is removed to reduce the breast size. Breast Asymmetry  Up to 25 percent of teens will have breasts growing in an asymmetrical fashion, and many women reach full maturity with one breast that is larger than the other. Sometimes, this is because they are shaped differently and grow differently. Other times, when a benign mass called a      fibroadenoma  is present in the breast, it is removed to allow the breast to return to its normal size.  Other cases of asymmetry require consideration about how to balance the breasts. Balancing can be a combination of enlarging one side, reducing one side, or working on both sides. While parents or teens who are concerned should seek a medical evaluation, padded bras can often provide camouflage. Breast Masses in Children and Teens  Because of heightened awareness of breast cancer, any lump in a child often creates a great deal of anxiety. Breast cancer is extremely rare before the age of 20; less than 0.1% of all breast cancer occurs in children or teens. Ultrasound studies can help determine whether a lump is a cyst that can be drained or a fibroadenoma.  If your child has a breast mass, talk to your child's doctor. He or she can      refer  you to a pediatric specialist or      pediatric plastic surgeon  who specializes in caring for growth problems in breast tissue. Breast operations on young girls should be carefully undertaken because of the risk of adverse effects upon future breast development. All girls should be taught breast self-examination once their breasts are developing and they are going through their menstrual cycles. This should be the beginning of a lifelong habit. Absence of Breast Development When a girl does not have breast tissue by the age of 13, her breast development is considered       delayed . Although rare, the breast bud may be nonexistent due to a chest wall deformity or failure of the underlying pectoralis muscle to develop properly. Girls with chronic illnesses like Crohn's disease, Turner syndrome, or an eating disorder may also fail to grow buds by the age of 13.      See  Delayed Puberty in Girls: Information for Parents.

        "content": "​​​What does hypothyroidism mean? Hypothyroidism refers to an underactive thyroid gland that does not produce enough of the active hormones T3 and T4. This condition can be present at birth or can be acquired any time during childhood or adulthood.  Hypothyroidism is very common and occurs in about 1 in 1,250 children . In most cases, the condition is permanent and will require treatment for life.  About the thyroid gland: The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ located in the middle of the neck. It is responsible for producing the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. This production is controlled by the pituitary gland in the brain via thyroid stimulating hormone (called TSH). T3 and T4 perform many important actions during childhood, including the maintenance of normal growth and bone development.  Thyroid hormone is also important in the regulation of metabolism . What causes acquired hypothyroidism? The causes of hypothyroidism can arise from the gland itself or from the pituitary. The thyroid can be damaged by direct antibody attack (autoimmunity), radiation, or surgery. The pituitary gland can be damaged following a severe brain injury or secondary to radiation. Certain medications and substances can interfere with thyroid hormone production. For example, too much or too little iodine in the diet can lead to hypothyroidism.  See the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy statement,  Iodine Deficiency, Pollutant Chemicals, and the Thyroid: New Information on an Old Problem , for more information.   Overall, the most common cause of hypothyroidism in children and teens is direct attack of the thyroid gland from the immune system . This disease is known as autoimmune or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Who is at the greatest risk? Certain children are at greater risk of hypothyroidism; this includes children with  congenital  syndromes, especially  Down syndrome , children with  type 1 diabetes , and children who have received radiation for  cancer treatment . What are the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism? The signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism include: Tiredness Modest weight gain (no more than 5-10 lb) Feeling cold Dry skin Hair loss Constipation Poor growth Often, your doctor will also be able to palpate an enlarged thyroid gland in the neck. This is called a goiter. How is hypothyroidism diagnosed? Simple blood tests are used to diagnose hypothyroidism. These include the measurement of hormones produced by the thyroid gland and pituitary. Free T4 (which is more accurate than just the total T4) and TSH are measured. The tests are inexpensive and widely available at your regular doctor's office. Hypothyroidism is diagnosed when the stimulating hormone from the pituitary (TSH) is high and the free T4 produced from the thyroid is low. If there is not enough TSH, then both levels will be low. Normal ranges for free T4 and TSH are somewhat different in children than adults, so the diagnosis should be made in consultation with a  pediatric endocrinologist . What is the treatment for hypothyroidism? Hypothyroidism is treated using a synthetic thyroid hormone called Levothyroxine. This is a once-daily pill that is usually given for life. There are very few side effects, and when they do occur, it is usually the result of significant overtreatment. Your doctor will prescribe the medication and then perform repeat blood testing. We wait at least 6-8 weeks, because it takes a long time for the body to adjust to the new hormone levels. If the medication is working, blood testing will show normal levels of TSH and free T4. You should contact your doctor if your child experiences difficulty falling asleep or restless sleep or difficulty concentrating in school. These may be signs that your current thyroid hormone dose may be too high and you are being over treated. There is no cure for hypothyroidism; however, hormone replacement is safe and effective.  With once-daily medication and close follow-up with your pediatric endocrinologist, your child can live a normal, healthy life.",

        "content": "​What is congenital hypothyroidism? Hypothyroidism refers to an underactive thyroid gland.  Congenital hypothyroidism occurs when a newborn infant is born without the ability to make normal amounts of thyroid hormone.  The condition occurs in about 1 in 3,000-4,000 children, is most often permanent and treatment is lifelong.  Thyroid hormone is important for your  baby's brain development  as well as growth, therefore, untreated congenital hypothyroidism can lead to  intellectual disabilities  and  growth failure . However, because there is excellent treatment available, with early diagnosis and treatment, your baby is likely to lead a normal, healthy life. What causes congenital hypothyroidism? Congenital hypothyroidism most often occurs when the thyroid gland does not develop properly, either because it is missing, is too small, or ends up in the wrong part of the neck. Sometimes the gland is formed properly but does not produce hormone in the right way. Also, sometimes the thyroid is missing the signal from the pituitary (master) gland, which tells it to produce thyroid hormone.  In a small number of cases, medications taken during pregnancy, mainly medications for treating an overactive thyroid, can lead to congenital hypothyroidism, which is temporary in most cases. Congenital hypothyroidism is usually not  inherited  through families. This means if one child is affected, it is unlikely that other children you may have in the future will suffer from the same condition. What are the signs and symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism? The symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism in the first week of life are not usually obvious. However, sometimes when hypothyroidism is severe, there may be: Poor feeding Excessive sleeping Weak cry Constipation Prolonged jaundice (yellow skin) after birth In these babies, the doctor may find a puffy face, poor muscle strength, and a large tongue with a distended abdomen and larger-than-normal fontanelles (soft spots) on the  head . How is congenital hypothyroidism diagnosed? Given the difficulty in diagnosing congenital hypothyroidism in the newborn period based on signs and symptoms, all hospitals in the United States, under the supervision of state health departments, screen for this disease using blood collected from your baby's heel before discharge from the hospital. This process is called  newborn screening .  See the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy statement,  Update of Newborn Screening and Thereapy for Congenital Hypothyroidism , for more information.  When there is a positive result (a low level of thyroid hormone with a high level of thyroid-stimulating hormone, called TSH, from the pituitary), the screening program immediately notifies the baby's doctor, usually before the baby is 2 weeks old. Before starting treatment, your baby's doctor will order a blood sample from a vein to confirm the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism. In some cases, the doctor may order a thyroid scan to see if the thyroid gland is missing or too small. What is the treatment for congenital hypothyroidism? Congenital hypothyroidism is treated by giving thyroid hormone medication in a pill form called levothyroxine. Many children will require treatment for life. Levothyroxine should be crushed and given once daily, mixed with a small amount of water, formula, or breast milk using a dropper or syringe. Giving your baby his or her thyroid hormone EVERY DAY and having regular checkups with a pediatric endocrinologist will help ensure that your baby will have normal growth and brain development . Your doctor will  do  periodic thyroid function tests so that the dose of medication can be properly adjusted as your child grows.  The hormone in the pill is identical to what is made in the body, and you are just replacing what is missing. In general, side effects occur only if the dose is too high, which the endocrinologist can avoid by checking blood levels on a periodic basis.",

        "content": "At each of your child’s checkups, your pediatrician’s office should plot your child’s weight and measurements. In general, you should see a continuous  upward trend, although there will be times when she gains very slowly and perhaps some weeks when she actually loses a little weight due to illness. It is not normal for her to stop growing or to lose weight except for the small amount she loses during the first few days of life. If she does lose weight, it is a clear sign either that she is not getting enough to eat or that she is ill. The medical term for this condition is  failure to thrive.  Although it can happen in older children who are seriously ill or undernourished, it is most common and most dangerous during the active growth period of the first three years.\t If allowed to continue for a prolonged period, this condition can become serious. Steady weight gain is especially important for infants and toddlers because it means that they are receiving adequate nutrition and care for normal physical, mental, and emotional development.\t Usually when a child stops growing, it is due to a feeding problem that prevents her from getting as many calories as she needs. As a newborn, she may be too fussy to eat as much as she needs, or, if breastfed, she may not be getting enough milk while nursing. Some children may require more food than their parents are able to provide. These problems must be detected and treated early in order to avoid long-term or permanent damage.\t Sometimes failure to thrive signals a medical problem. The newborn may have an infection passed on from her mother during pregnancy, or she may have a hormonal difficulty, an allergy, or a digestive problem that prevents nutrients from being absorbed into the body properly. Diseases such as cystic fibrosis, diabetes, or heart disease also can interfere with normal growth. If one of these is present, the child may need a special diet as well as medical treatment.\t When to Get Help\t Regularly charting your child’s growth, and comparing her general development with others her age, are the best ways to make sure she is thriving. If she does not gain weight, grow in length, or otherwise develop normally, consult your pediatrician. He will measure and examine your child, ask about her diet and eating patterns, and review her medical history for signs of illness that may be contributing to her failure to thrive. The physician will try to establish exactly when the growth or weight gain stopped, and ask about anything that may have contributed to this. The pediatrician also may watch your child eating or nursing to see how much she consumes and how she responds to food. Sometimes a short period of in-hospital observation may be necessary.\t If the doctor discovers a physical cause for the decrease in growth rate, he will recommend the appropriate treatment. If there is no physical reason, however, the pediatrician will look for emotional or social problems, particularly within the family. Such disturbances can decrease a child’s appetite or alter her normal food intake and digestion. Once discovered, these difficulties can be treated with individual or family counseling.",

        "content": "​​​What is growth hormone deficiency? Growth hormone deficiency is a rare cause of growth failure in which the child does not make enough growth hormone to grow normally. Growth hormone is one of several hormones made by the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain behind the nose. How frequent is growth hormone deficiency? Estimates vary, but it is rare. The incidence is less than 1 in 3,000 to 1 in 10,000 children. What causes growth hormone deficiency? There are many causes of growth hormone deficiency, most of which are present at birth  (called \" congenital \")  but may take several years to become apparent or it can develop later  (called \"acquired\") . Congenital causes include genetic or structural abnormalities of the development of the pituitary gland and surrounding structures, while acquired causes, which are much less common, can include head trauma, infection, tumor, or radiation. What are signs and symptoms of growth hormone deficiency? Children with growth hormone deficiency are usually  much shorter than their peers   (that is,  well below the 3 rd  percentile line )  and over time, they tend to drop farther and farther below the normal range. It is important to note that growth hormone-deficient children are usually not underweight for their height; in many cases, they are on the pudgy side, especially around the stomach. How is growth hormone deficiency diagnosed? Evaluation of a child with short stature and slow growth pattern may include a bone age  x-ray   (x-ray of the left wrist and hand)  and various screening laboratory tests. The diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency cannot be made on a single random growth hormone level, because growth hormone is secreted in pulses. Some  pediatric endocrinologists  diagnose growth hormone deficiency based on an extremely low level of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which varies much less in the course of the day than growth hormone. IGF- 1 levels are dependent on the amount of growth hormone in the blood but can also be low in normal, young children, so the test must be interpreted carefully. A more accurate but still imperfect way to diagnose growth hormone deficiency is a growth hormone stimulation test. In this test, your child has blood drawn for about 2 to 3 hours after being given medications to increase growth hormone release. If the child does not produce enough growth hormone after this stimulation, then the child is diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency. However, growth hormone stimulation tests can over diagnose growth hormone deficiency. Growth hormone stimulation tests vary and are complicated, so they are usually performed under the guidance of a pediatric endocrinologist. Usually, other tests to check the pituitary or to evaluate the brain ( MRI ) are performed when treatment is considered. How is growth hormone deficiency treated? The treatment for growth hormone deficiency is administration of recombinant human growth hormone by subcutaneous injection (under the skin) once a day. The pediatric endocrinologist calculates the initial dose based on weight, and then bases the dose on response and puberty. The parent is instructed on how to administer the growth hormone to the child at home, rotating injection sites among the arms, legs, buttocks, and stomach. The length of growth hormone treatment depends on how well the child's height responds to  growth hormone injections  and  how puberty affects the growth . Usually, the child is on growth hormone injections until growth is complete, which is sometimes many years. What are the side effects of growth hormone treatment? In general, there are few children who experience side effects from growth hormone. Side effects that have been described include severe headaches, hip problems, and problems at the injection site. To avoid scarring, you should place the injections at different sites. However, side effects are generally rare. Please read the package insert for a full list of side effects. How is the dose of growth hormone determined? The pediatric endocrinologist calculates the initial dose based on weight and condition being treated. At later visits, the doctor will change the dose for effect and pubertal stage and sometimes based on IGF-1 blood test results. The length of growth hormone treatment depends on how well the child's height responds to growth hormone injections and how puberty affects growth. What is the prognosis for growth hormone deficiency? Growth hormone usually results in an increase in height for growth hormone-deficient individuals, as long as the growth plates have not fused. The reason for the growth hormone deficiency should be understood, and it is important to recheck for growth hormone deficiency when the child is an adult, because some children no longer test as if they are growth hormone deficient when they are fully grown.

It's probably the most important piece of data your pediatrician gets. The reason is, it can capture so much about your child's vitality.

It's based on gender and lots of data. We watch for changes in the size of head circumference in infancy because we want to know that the brain is growing. Growth grids have been used since the 1970s, but back in 2000, they were revised to really reflect different cultural and ethnic diversities that exist within our population. Why Percentiles Are Not Like the Grades in School What we want from a growth grid is to really map out the ideal growth for children. This isn't like grades in school. When your child comes in at the 10th percentile, it's really no better or worse than coming in at the 90th. What we care about most is the trend at which your baby or child gains weight, height, or head circumference. After age 2, you can use the growth chart to expand between the ages of 2 and 20. In addition to weight and height at that point, we also look at      body mass index , that number where we try to capture how children's proportionality is. Are they at risk for      overweight  or are they too lean? Everything from      genetics , to environment, to      nutrition , to      activity , to health problems really influence how your child grows. Why we review it each time is to talk about threats to your baby's or child's health and ways that you can take great opportunity to make changes. How to Follow the Grid: When you're looking at a growth grid, what you want to focus on is how your child is changing. One static point on the growth grid isn't as relevant as 5 data points over time. You want to know rates at which your baby or child is growing and the rate compared with the grid. As you follow the grid along from infancy into toddlerhood, you'll notice that each time it will rise. Each data point at each set of time will increase. We care about the rate at which your baby or child grows, not the number. Why You Shouldn't Focus on the Number: Parents often come in to the office and say, \"What percent is she at?\" She might be at the 13th percentile; that might be phenomenal based on where she's been previously, or it might be concerning. Don't focus on the number. Have your pediatrician, family doctor, or nurse practitioner help you understand what the trends are for your baby's growth. Parents, pediatricians, and nurses have been using growth charts since the late 1970s to track growth in infants and children. The charts were revised back in 2000 as data for the first charts (from a small study in Ohio) didn't accurately reflect the cultural and ethnic diversity of our communities. The Hallmark of the Well-Child Check: The hallmark of a well-child check is the review of a child's growth. Growth can be a reflection of a child's overall health, nutrition, or tolerance of possible underlying medical conditions. So understanding what your doctor or nurse practitioner says about your child's growth should be a priority. If your doctor doesn't have a computer in the examination room, ask to see the chart on paper or on a computer in the office. It will not only inform you, I suspect it will delight you to see what your child has done since the last time he was seen. The human body really is a fine-tuned machine, and growth is simply astounding if you really stop to think of it. It's true your baby will at least double his weight by 6 months and triple it by about 1 year of age. If You Have Questions: If you have a challenge understanding how your child is growing or how the growth chart is presented, demand clarification. It's OK if you don't understand the presentation of facts on these grids; have confidence to speak up and ask the doctor or nurse practitioner to explain it.

        "content": "Parents often wonder how tall their toddler or preschooler might be when they grow up. Gradeschoolers and young teens may ask,      \"How tall will I be?\"  It is a natural question for parents and children, and besides being a little fun to try and predict how tall a child might be, pediatricians also find it helpful to make sure a child is      growing as  expected. While no one has a crystal ball, there are ways parents and pediatricians can make an educated guess. Read on.  How is a Child's Adult Height Predicted?  The most accurate method of height prediction comes from using a child's \"bone age,\" determined by an      X-ray  of the hand, but there are several methods you can use at home to get an idea of how tall your child will eventually become. The most common way to estimate a child's adult height is to base it on the parents' heights.  Two Years Times Two Method Did you know the earliest growth spurt, from baby to toddler, actually accounts for roughly half of a child's adult height? A simple method to predict adult height is to double the child's height at age 2. Girls develop more quickly, so doubling their height at 18 months old can also be used as an estimate of how tall they will be as adults. While this method has been around for a long time, no research exists to demonstrate its accuracy.  Mid-Parental Method A slightly more complex method of predicting your child's height is known as the      \"mid-parental method.\"  Add together the measured heights of the mother and father in inches and divide by 2.\t For a boy:  add 2½ inches\t For a girl:  subtract 2½ inches\t Note:  This is just a very rough estimate of the average height of how tall a child will be when fully grown. You can expect a margin of error of about four inches up or down. The taller the parents, the taller the child is likely to be; similarly, the shorter the parents, the shorter the child. Growth Charts  Regular measurements of a child's height, weight and head size and plotting them on a      growth chart  are a good way to see if your child is growing as expected. Pediatricians use standardized growth charts at each      well-child visit . What many people don't realize is that growth charts are also helpful for judging the      onset of puberty  in an older child. As you may know, puberty is occurring at an earlier age these days. The onset of pubic hair or breast budding in girls can occur normally as early as age six! Growth charts can help pediatricians determine whether your child's early development is in the normal range.  Family History & Genetics  Height and growth patterns usually  run in families . Your child's pediatrician may ask about your own height, since your genetic make-up is the biggest factor in how your children grow. You may also be asked how tall other family members are. Additionally, you may be asked how fast and at what age you grew during your childhood (i.e. your growth pattern). Were you short in grade school but kept growing after all of your friends stopped? Did you go through      puberty early  or      late ? These may be important clues for your child's pediatrician. What Else Affects Your Child's Height? While genes play a huge part in predetermining how tall your child will be (e.g. short parents usually have short children) other factors have an impact on how much your child grows. These include:\t Nutrition:  A         child who is overweight  is often taller than classmates, although that does not necessarily mean that he will be taller as an adult. Children who are very underweight might be shorter than expected for age.\t Hormones:  Hormone imbalances, such as low thyroid or growth hormone levels, lead to slower than expected growth and can result in children who are either shorter or taller than would be expected if not diagnosed and treated.         Review red flags  to help you tell if your child is growing normally and will reach his predicted height or if he might have a         growth hormone problem .\t Medications:  Some medications, particularly chronic use of         corticosteroids  (like prednisone), can slow growth.\t Health conditions:  Children with some chronic illnesses, such as severe         arthritis , untreated         celiac disease , or         cancer  may be shorter than expected. \t Genetic conditions:  Children with some genetic conditions can cause either short or tall stature. For example, those with         Down Syndrome , Noonan Syndrome, or         Turner Syndrome  tend to be shorter than other family members, while Marfan Syndrome can cause someone to be taller.   Additionally, exercise, pollution, sleep patterns, climate, fitness, diet, and psychological well-being can also impact growth. If You Have Concerns about Your Child's Height:   If you are concerned about your child's height or think that your child may be growing too fast or too slowly, talk to your pediatrician. If needed, your pediatrician can order further tests. A simple x-ray of the hand and wrist may show how much growth your child has left. Lab tests can also help find the cause of growth problems and how to treat them. You may also be referred to a      pediatric endocrinologist ,      pediatric geneticist , or other pediatric specialist for further evaluation and treatment.  Don't delay! Remember, once your child finishes puberty, growth stops. A short teenager has little or no time to catch up on growth, while a younger child still has time to be treated and grow taller.",

        "content": "What is growth hormone treatment? Growth hormone is a protein hormone that is usually made by the pituitary gland to help your child grow. After training, you will be giving your child an injection of      recombinant growth hormone (rGH)  every day, once per day.      Recombinant  means that this growth hormone shot is created in the laboratory to be identical to human growth hormone. Growth hormone has been available for treatment since the 1950s. However, rGH is safer than the original preparations, because it does not contain human or animal tissue. What are the side effects of growth hormone treatment? In general, there are few children who experience side effects due to growth hormone. Side effects that have been described include headache and problems at the injection site.  To avoid scarring, you should place the injections at different sites such as arms, legs, belly and buttocks. However, side effects are generally rare. Please read the package insert for a full list of side effects. How is the dose of growth hormone determined? The      pediatric endocrinologist  calculates the initial dose based upon weight and condition being treated. At later visits, the doctor will increase the dose for effect and pubertal stage.

        "content": "​    Short stature  refers to any child who has a height well below what is typical for that child's age and sex. The term is most commonly applied to children whose height, when plotted on a growth curve in the pediatrician's office, is below the line marking the third or fifth percentile.  What is a growth chart? A     growth chart  uses lines to display an average growth path for a child of a certain age, sex, and height. Each line indicates a certain percent- age of the population who would be that particular height at a particular age. If a boy's height is plotted on the 25th percentile line, for example, this indicates that approximately 25 out of 100 boys his age are shorter than him. Children often do not follow these lines exact- ly, but most often, their growth over time is roughly parallel to these lines. A child who has a height plotted below the third percentile line is considered to have short stature compared with the general population. The growth charts can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Web site at     https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/data/set1clinical/set1bw.pdf .  What kind of growth pattern is atypical? Growth specialists take many things into account when assessing your child's growth. For example, the heights of a child's parents are an important indicator of     how tall a child is likely to be  when fully grown. A child born to parents who have below-average height will most likely grow to have an adult height below average as well. The rate of growth, referred to as the     growth velocity,  is also important. A child who is not growing at the same rate as that child's friends will slowly drop further down on the growth curve as the child ages, such as crossing from the 25th percentile line to the fifth percentile line. Such crossing of percentile lines on the growth curve is often a warning sign of an underlying medical problem affecting growth.  What causes short stature? Although growth that is slower than a child's friends may be a sign of a significant health problem, most children who have short stature have no medical condition and are healthy. Causes of short stature not associated with recognized diseases include\t Familial short stature  (One or both parents are short, but the child's rate of growth is normal.)\t Constitutional \t   delay in growth and puberty  (A child is short during most of childhood but will have late onset of puberty and end up in the typical height range as an adult because the child will have more time to grow.)\t Idiopathic short stature  (There is no identifiable cause, but the child is healthy.) Short stature may occasionally be a sign that a child does have a serious health problem, but there are usually clear symptoms suggesting something is not right. Medical conditions affecting growth can include:\t Chronic medical conditions  affecting nearly any major organ, including heart disease, asthma, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, kidney disease, anemia, and bone disorders, as well as patients of a pediatric oncologist and those with growth issues as a result of chemotherapy\t Hormone deficiencies , including hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, diabetes\t Cushing disease , in which the body makes too much cortisol, the body's stress hormone or prolonged high dose steroid treatment\t Genetic conditions , including Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, Silver-Russell syndrome, and Noonan syndrome\t Poor nutrition\t Babies with a history of being born small  for gestational age or with a history of        fetal or intrauterine growth restriction\t Medications , such as those used to treat        attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder  and inhaled steroids used for asthma  What tests might be used to assess your child? The best \"test\" is to monitor your child's growth over time using the growth chart. Six months is a typical time frame for older children; if your child's growth rate is clearly normal, no additional testing may be needed. In addition, your child's doctor may check your child's bone age (radiograph of left hand and wrist) to help predict how tall your child will be as an adult. Blood tests are rarely helpful in a mildly short but healthy child who is growing at a normal growth rate, such as a child growing along the fifth percentile line. However, if your child is below the third percentile line or is growing more slowly than normal, your child's doctor will usually perform some blood tests to look for signs of one or more of the medical conditions described previously.

        "content": "Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a rare but serious illness that can cause sudden weakness of muscles, loss of reflexes, and paralysis. Three spikes in cases of AFM occurred in the United States—in late summer to early fall of 2014, 2016, and 2018—with over 660 confirmed cases. Most of the AFM cases in these outbreaks were in children around 5 years old. (See \" How a Summer Cold Led to a Rare AFM Diagnosis ,\" below.) While the condition sounds frightening, keep in mind that AFM is very rare. The chances of a child getting it are less than one in a million. What causes AFM? Several viruses (for example, West Nile virus) are known to cause AFM. New spikes in AFM cases have been caused by non-polio enteroviruses such as    enterovirus D68  (EV-D68). These viruses typically cause respiratory symptoms, including asthma-like illnesses. They are common in late summer and early fall, coinciding with these AFM spikes. In 2014, there was a rise in AFM cases during an    EV-D68 outbreak . Since that 2014 outbreak, enteroviruses have been the most commonly identified viruses in lab samples from patients who had AFM. A recent uptick in children with respiratory illnesses due to rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, including EV-D68, was reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ). Can AFM be prevented? We do not know why some children develop this condition after a common viral respiratory infection and others don't. However, parents can remind children to follow these simple steps to help avoid illness: Frequent    handwashing Staying up to date on recommended    childhood and adolescent immunizations Keeping household surfaces clean by    sanitizing and disinfecting Keeping your children home from    child care  or school when they are sick Wearing    insect repellent  when mosquitos are near \t Immediately seek medical care if your child develops sudden arm or leg weakness, a droopy face, or has difficulty swallowing or speaking . \t   How a Summer Cold Led to Rare AFM Diagnosis   \t By Rachel Scott\t \t  We all have a picture in our minds of how our lives as a family will unfold. But lives can be derailed in a thousand different ways. For us, it was when our perfectly healthy 5-year-old son, Braden, was suddenly paralyzed over the July 4 holiday in 2016.   \t He'd had a cold the week prior. On the 4th he was lethargic and couldn't keep food down. We were so busy we didn't pause to take his symptoms seriously. We now know that his swallowing muscles were being paralyzed—and that paralysis was gradually spreading through his body. Five days later, the paralysis reached his diaphraghm and he stopped breathing. He was intubated and life-flighted to a major hospital. It was there that we got the diagnosis of acute flaccid myelitis. \t We had never heard of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) before Braden's diagnosis—and none of his doctors had ever treated a child with AFM. We learned that AFM is a rare, polio-like disease that causes limb weakness and paralysis following a cold. We soon sought out parents for advice and began advocating for treatments and therapy. It felt like we were caught in a whirlwind and dropped into a new life—new setting, new language, new everything. \t Braden remained in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for nearly two months. He needed a tracheotomy and ventilator to breathe for him, and a feeding tube to feed him. When he was stable, he was transferred to a rehab facility. For nearly six months, Braden worked amazingly hard before he could return home.\t Therapy was—and continues to be—the key to Braden's recovery. While in rehab, we learned how to care for his trach and feeding tube and developed a home therapy routine for him. He continued to work hard upon discharge. Home therapy, outpatient therapy, and several return trips to inpatient therapy have provided an intense boost.\t Our lives were changed. Home nurses were brought in to care for him while he slept; we learned how to run medical equipment and keep his body safe and healthy. His siblings gained a new appreciation for disability and kids who are different. We know more about acute flaccid myelitis than we could have imagined—especially that limb weakness following a cold is a medical emergency and should be taken seriously. Now, Braden is thriving and living his best life—even if that life doesn't match the picture we once had.\t   Rachel Scott is founder of the  Accute Flaccid Myeltis Association  and author of   Alfredo's Magic Wand: A Children's Book About Acute Flaccid Myelitis.  She's pictured above with her family, including Braden (lower left). Is there a treatment for AFM? There is no specific treatment for AFM. However, doctors who specialize in neurologic and infectious diseases will tailor a treatment plan and recommend certain interventions, depending on the case. During the acute phase of the illness, most of the treatment is supportive—helping the child to breathe, for example. Many children with AFM have also benefited from early physical and occupational therapy. A special    AFM Physician Consult and Support Portal  was created to connect medical professionals with neurologists specializing in AFM and other rare, complex neuro-immune disorders.  Polio vaccines remain important—they prevent paralysis.    Prior to the    polio vaccine , which was introduced in 1955, poliovirus was very common in the United States. It paralyzed and killed thousands every year. Thanks to the vaccine,    poliovirus poliomyelitis  has become rare in the United States. Recently, a case of poliomyelitis was reported in New York and    poliovirus was detected in sewage  there. It only takes one person infected with poliovirus to spread the disease if we are not protected by vaccination. That's why routine polio vaccines are still important.

        "content": "My child gets sick in the car quite often. How can we keep this from happening?\t Motion sickness occurs when the brain receives conflicting signals from the motion-sensing parts of the body: the inner ears, the eyes, and nerves in the extremities. Under usual circumstances, all three areas respond to any motion. When the signals they receive and send are inconsistent—for example, if you watch rapid motion on a movie screen, your eyes sense the motion, but your inner ear and joints do not—the brain receives conflicting signals and activates a response that can make you sick. The same thing can happen when a child is sitting so low in the backseat of a car that she cannot see outside. Her inner ear senses the motion, but her eyes and joints do not. \t Signs and symptoms\t Motion sickness usually starts with a vague feeling of stomach upset (queasiness), a cold sweat, fatigue, and loss of appetite. This usually progresses to vomiting. A young child may not be able to describe queasiness, but will demonstrate it by becoming pale and restless, yawning, and crying. Later she will lose interest in food (even her favorite ones), and even vomit. This response can be affected by previous car trips that made her sick, but it usually improves over time.\t Causes\t We do not know why motion sickness happens more often in some children than others. Since many of these children years later experience occasional headaches, there is a belief that motion sickness may be an early form of migraine.\t Motion sickness occurs most often on a first boat or plane ride, or when the motion is very intense, such as that caused by rough water or turbulent air. Stress and excitement also can start this problem or make it worse. \t What you can do \t If your child starts to develop the symptoms of motion sickness, the best approach is to stop the activity that is causing the problem. If it occurs in the car, stop as soon as safely possible and let her get out and walk around. If you are on a long car trip, you may have to make frequent short stops, but it will be worth it. If this condition develops on a swing or merry-go-round, stop the motion promptly and get your child off the equipment. \t Since “car sickness” is the most common form of motion sickness in children, many preventive measures have been developed. In addition to frequent stops, try the following.\t If she has not eaten for three hours, give your child a  light  snack before the trip—which also helps on a boat or plane. This relieves hunger pangs, which seem to add to the symptoms.\t Try to focus her attention away from the queasy feeling. Listen to the radio, sing, or talk. \t Have her look at things outside the car, not at books or games.\t If none of the above works, stop the car, remove her from her car seat, and have her lie on her back for a few minutes with her eyes closed. A cool cloth on the forehead also tends to lessen the symptoms. \t Medications\t If you are going on a trip and your child has had motion sickness before, you might want to give her medication ahead of time to prevent problems. Some of these medications are available without a prescription, but ask your pediatrician before using them. Although they can help, they often produce side effects, such as drowsiness (which means that when you get to your destination your child might be too tired to enjoy it), dry mouth and nose, or blurred vision. \t When to call the pediatrician\t If your child has symptoms of motion sickness at times when she is not involved with a movement activity—particularly if she also has a headache; difficulty hearing, seeing, walking, or talking; or if she stares off into space—tell your pediatrician about it. These may be symptoms of problems other than motion sickness.",

        "content": "​By: Caitlin Haxel, MD, FAAP \t & Juan Villafane, MD, FAAP Passing out or fainting―also known by the medical term syncope―is common among young people, especially teenagers. \t As many as \t   1 in 4  healthy children and adolescents have fainted at some point. Has your child?   Although the experience can be frightening, it's      usually  not caused by anything serious. Most young people recover quickly after fainting, typically in less than one minute. \t It's important for parents to learn about common fainting triggers such as dehydration and get prompt treatment when needed. A visit to the pediatrician or cardiologist may be necessary to rule out rare but potentially serious causes of fainting. What causes a healthy child to faint? Most often, fainting happens in otherwise healthy children when there is a temporary drop in the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the brain (blood pressure). Usually, the child recovers quickly. This is called      simple fainting. Triggers for simple fainting can include:\t Not drinking enough fluids ―especially during            hot weather  or in overheated spaces. Dehydration is the most common cause of fainting in children. Not drinking enough fluids also reduces blood volume and lowers blood pressure. \t Standing still for a long time in one place . This can cause the blood to pool in the legs because of gravity or standing up quickly. \t Overheating ―especially in overcrowded environments. \t Strong emotions in response to pain, blood, or something shocking or scary . This can cause the part of the brain that controls blood pressure, breathing rate, and heart rate to suddenly switch gears and get out of sync.\t Hyperventilating or breathing too fast . This can happen due to anxiety or fear, because it causes rapid changes in our blood supply to the brain.  \t Breath-holding spells . These are common in young children during            temper tantrums  or when they are in pain.            Breath-holding spells  generally are not serious, and most children outgrow them by 6 years of age. \t Certain movements , such as coughing, swallowing, weight lifting, going to the bathroom, or even hair-grooming may stretch or press on sensitive nerve endings. This trigger is rare and usually affects teens; with the vast majority outgrowing it. The choking game: beware of dangerous internet challenges!\t The  \"choking game,\" the \"fainting  game,\" \"pass out,\" and \"blackout\"―names of a few of the \t \t  dangerous internet challenges  on social media where kids try to fainting on purpose. The \"challenge\" involves cutting off blood and oxygen to the brain by wrapping a belt or a similar object around the neck to experience a \"high\" when letting go.\t Statistics  compiled by the non-profit group Games Adolescents Shouldn't Play (GASP) show hundreds of adolescents worldwide have died from the choking game during the past two decades. Middle school students with symptoms of depression or behavior problems may be at an especially high risk of playing the choking game, according to a recent \t \t  study . \t Signs your child might be trying it include bloodshot eyes and frequent headaches. Talk with your kids about how internet challenges that may seem harmless and funny can easily land them in the emergency room. What are some warning signs and symptoms before fainting?  About 5 to 10 seconds before fainting, there are a number of warning signs including: Dizziness or lightheadedness Nausea A surge of warmth and sweating, or sudden cold feeling Blurry or spotty vision \"Ringing\" in the ears Pale or ashy appearance  Faster heart rate (called  tachycardia) If my child has fainted before, should I tell her teachers and coaches? Yes. They can help watch for signs and help her to the floor if it happens again and help avoid risks like having her stand at the end of a row in crowded bleachers. What to do when a child faints:  1.      If possible, try to catch and ease a child to the floor. 2.      Have the child raise both legs for 10 minutes while lying down. If the child has food in her mouth, lay her on her side with her face turned toward the floor so she                        does not choke  on the food. 3.                     Call 911  or go to the nearest emergency department if the child: Isn't waking up after a short amount of time Has injuries from the fall and is bleeding a lot Fainted suddenly after taking medicine, being stung by an insect, or eating something she may be allergic to Was exercising when they fainted Is having trouble breathing, talking, or moving\t Can fainting be a sign of a more serious medical condition? In some cases, fainting can be a sign of an underlying health problem or condition, such as:\t Iron-deficiency .            Anemia , when there's insufficient iron in the blood to deliver enough oxygen to brain, can cause of fainting in rapidly growing teens—especially girls who get            heavy periods .\t Internal bleeding . A blow to the head (such as a            concussion ) or belly. \t Diabetes . Sudden drops in blood sugar can cause fainting. The brain needs sugar for energy.            Diabetes  also can cause increased urination that leads to dehydration. If a child with diabetes faints, it is considered a diabetic emergency.            Use this form  from \"Helping the Student with Diabetes Succeed: A Guide for School Personnel\" to prepare a hypoglycemia emergency care plan.\t Eating disorders. \t Anorexia and bulimia  can cause fainting from dehydration, low blood sugar, and changes in blood pressure or circulation caused by starvation, vomiting, or over exercising.\t Heart issues.\t Irregular heartbeats  (cardiac arrythmia) or structural problems (heart or valve) can cause fainting. Fainting that happens during exercise always needs medical follow-up.\t Migraines.  Fainting is a symptom of certain types of            migraine  headaches. \t Alcohol and drug use . Alcohol makes blood vessels dilate or widen which can cause the blood pressure to drop. Some            illegal drugs , like methamphetamines, affect heart function and can lead to fainting. \t Pregnancy.  Changes to the circulatory system in pregnancy can affect blood pressure and increase the body's need for fluids. \t Postural orthostasis tachycardia syndrome (POTS) . This condition affects an estimated            1 in 100 teens  who get a rapid heartbeat and lightheadedness or fainting when standing, especially after lying down. Episodes often start after viral illness, trauma, or major surgery. \t Addison's Disease/adrenal insufficiency . Children with this condition don't produce enough hormones, such as cortisol, that help control the response to stress, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels. How is more serious fainting diagnosed and treated? For child who faints on several occasions, or if there are signs of a more serious medical condition, your pediatrician may refer your child to a      pediatric cardiologist . While there, your child may receive various kinds of heart tests.  See \t   Common Types of Cardiac Testing.  Red flag symptoms of possible heart issues with fainting:   Fainting during exercise Abnormal or especially fast heartbeats, particularly if they occur prior to fainting Family history of            sudden cardiac death . Your pediatrician may ask about any close relatives who died from unintentional injuries or            drowning , which may have involved cardiac-related fainting. Can I prevent my child from fainting? Your pediatrician can recommend ways to help prevent simple fainting.  Here are some ideas:\t Stay hydrated and eat well . Make sure your child drinks plenty of water or other            healthy beverages  each day. Limit caffeine and avoid skipping meals. \t Monitor blood pressure . If your child's blood pressure is low or normal, your pediatrician may suggest a change in his or her diet. .\t Flex muscles  in the legs, shift positions, and bend at the waist occasionally when standing for a long time to help circulation and blood flow to the brain.\t Take breaks from the heat . Avoid standing for long periods in warm environments, such as practice fields in the sun or crowded places. Limit time in hot showers, saunas, hot tubs, and Jacuzzis. \t Help your child learn to recognize the early signs of fainting . When his symptoms start, remind him to put his head between his legs or lay down. Are there medications to help prevent fainting? Medications may be prescribed in certain cases. Some types of steroids, beta blockers, and anti-arrhythmic drugs and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) anti-depressants  may  help some patients. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these medications in children and teens. Remember: Most children and teens who faint recover quickly and without any lasting harm. Knowing how to help prevent fainting spells, like getting plenty of fluids, can help avoid the scary experience of passing out.      Any time your child does faint, be sure to tell your pediatrician .

        "content": "By: Namrata Patel, MD & Steven Leber, MD, PhD, FAAP\t \"My head hurts.\"  Across the U.S., parents hear this complaint from their children and teenagers at a rate so frequent that it can be hard to know whether it is, in fact, a painful headache (or just an  excuse  to stay home from school). Head pain in babies and children too young to tell you their head hurts are often fussier, crankier, and unable sleep.  While most headaches are harmless and go away within a few hours, recurrent headaches of any type can cause school problems, behavioral problems, and/or depression. In this article, learn when to involve your pediatrician.      It's important to know when headaches may be a symptom of something more serious. \t   Home Care for Children's Headaches  Anyone who has ever had a mild, occasional headache knows rest and relaxation is often the best treatment. Other things like ice packs, warm shower or baths, naps in a dark room, and head and neck      massage  may also help.  Use Caution with Over-the-Counter Pain Medicine\t Don't be tempted to turn to over-the-counter pain medication every time your child complains of head pain.\t If you do, be sure to always read the label for any medication to determine the right dose based on your child's weight.  \t Acetaminophen  (Tylenol): You can give your child one dose to help reduce headache. Do not exceed the maximum dosage and frequency for children, 22-33 milligrams per pound within a 4-hour period.\t Ibuprofen  (Motrin/Advil): If acetaminophen does not initially work, you can also give one dose of ibuprofen. Do not exceed the maximum dosage and frequency for children, 13-22 milligrams per pound within a 12-hour period.  Keep track of how often you are giving these medications. If you are using more than 3 doses total per week, consult your pediatrician to determine if other medication is required. Using more than three doses per week can also lead to                        medication overuse headaches  (also known as analgesic rebound headaches). Children and teenagers can get these types of headaches from taking pain medicine too often, and therefore, being dependent on the medication. The over-the-counter medications no longer work to reduce pain, and the headaches become more frequent and more painful! Not good. \t Keep a Headache Diary  There are a number of types of headaches, as well as potential causes. So, it can be helpful to see if a pattern develops. There are many different apps and online tools available to help you and/or your child. Your pediatrician will use this information to determine the best course of treatment.  What to include in a headache diary? Date and time of headache How long did the headache last?  What symptoms did your child experience?  What helped relieve the pain?  What made the pain worse? Did anything specific happen that day (a test coming up in school, infectious symptoms, eating a certain food, trouble sleeping, etc.)? Common Types of Headaches: Each type of headache may be treated differently. A detailed history and physical exam help your pediatrician figure out what kind of headache your child has. Based on your child's diagnosis, your pediatrician will create a plan with you on how to best relieve your child's pain.  \t Common symptoms:\t Call pediatrician if your child has:\t Seek emergency care if your child has:                Tension headaches Mild or moderate headache Typically develops during the middle of the day Constant, dull or achy pain  Sensation of tightness that feels like a band or circle around the head  Pain located in the forehead or on both sides of the head Neck pain  Fatigue   Daily headaches Headaches caused by straining from coughing, sneezing, running or having a bowel movement. Headaches that occur along with pain in the eye or ear, confusion, nausea or vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, or numbness. Headaches that keep coming back and get worse. Headaches following a head injury that don't go away after a week. Headaches severe enough to wake from sleep.    ​  ​  ​ ​ Sudden, severe head pain happening for the first time--especially if your child has double vision, seems confused, sleepy, hard to wake up, has numbness or projectile vomiting. Headache with a stiff neck, or complaints of neck pain, especially with a fever.  ​  ​  ​  ​              Migraine headaches Throbbing pain that is often on one side of head, but can be on both sides--particularly in children Light and/or noise sensitivity  Fatigue Nausea and vomiting Mood changes An aura: flashes of light, zig-zag lines or other odd vision changes that may appear before or during a migraine \t Note: Some symptoms of a migraine may be slightly different in children than adults.              Congestion headaches Pain and pressure above a sinus, often above the eyebrow, behind the eye, and under the cheekbone  Pain may be on just one side of the face/head Blocked or runny nose              Medication overuse (analgesic rebound headaches) Pain starting behind the eyes and moving up the front of the head, or dull ache around the forehead Grogginess Irritability Flu-like aches and pains May start after pain reliever use ends Caffeine in sodas and energy drinks can also be a culprit              Headaches after a head injury Pain that feels like pressure inside the head Dizziness Mental fogginess Nausea Fatigue Moodiness Blurry vision   Does my child need a CT-scan?\t Imaging  of the brain, blood tests and invasive procedures are NOT required to diagnose headaches. In some cases, brain imaging or a lumbar puncture is needed if a more serious condition is suspected. If necessary, the pediatrician will discuss what further tests are needed and why. The pediatrician may also recommend that your child see a pediatric neurologist who can help provide further recommendations for your child's headache. Remember: Many times, when children get headaches, they'll be gone as quickly as they come. Rest, rehydration, and healthy routines will usually keep them go away. But, be sure to call your pediatrician any time you have concerns about your child's headache pain.

        "content": "Meningitis is a swelling (inflammation) of the tissues that cover the brain and spinal cord. Sometimes, the swelling affects the brain. Meningitis can be caused by medications, injuries, and conditions such as cancer and    lupus , but the most common cause is infection.\t Vaccines  protect against some—but not all—meningitis infections.  Learn about the different types of meningitis in children, which kids are most at risk, signs to know and other important information.  5 types of meningitis infections\t Bacterial meningitis  (several types of bacteria are involved) is usually spread from person to person. The bacteria can be found in or on the bodies of healthy children and adults. That does not mean they will become sick, but they can spread the bacteria to others. Bacterial meningitis can be deadly, so it is important to get medical help right away.\t Viral meningitis . Most meningitis infections are caused by viruses. Viral meningitis may be mild, but it is often more serious in infants less than three months of age and in other high-risk children. Certain viruses, such as    herpes simplex , can cause severe cases of viral meningitis, even in older children and adults.\t Amebic meningitis  is caused by an    amoeba  called    Naegleria fowleri . It infects people when the amoeba travels up the nose to the brain. It does not spread from person to person. The amoeba live in warm freshwater lakes and rivers    where people swim .    Naegleria fowleri  can also be found in contaminated pools and splash pads, tap water, and soil. People cannot get infected by drinking water that is contaminated with the amoeba. \t Parasitic meningitis  is much less common than viral and bacterial meningitis. The parasites are mostly found in animals. People get infected when they eat contaminated foods or if they accidentally swallow soil that is contaminated by feces of infected animals.\t Fungal meningitis  is caused by several types of fungi that live in the environment (in the soil). This infection can also be spread to patients during medical procedures if infection control practices are not followed.    Fungal meningitis outbreak Recently, there was an outbreak of    fungal meningitis  affecting people who had epidural anesthesia at two locations in Matamoros, Mexico, between Jan. 1 and May 13, 2023. Fungal meningitis can take weeks to develop, and mild symptoms can quickly become severe or deadly. Symptoms of fungal meningitis include fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity and confusion. Even if you do not have symptoms, you are at risk and should seek immediate medical attention. Children at higher risk of meningitis Children are at a higher risk of meningitis caused by a bacterial or viral infection. Children more likely to get the illness include: Newborns and babies  (Because their immune systems are not well developed, the bacteria can get into the bloodstream more easily.) Children with frequent    sinus infections Children with recent serious    head injuries  and skull fractures, or who have just had brain surgery Children with    cochlear implants Children who are not up to date on recommended vaccinations With early diagnosis and proper treatment, 7 out of 10 children who get bacterial meningitis recover without any complications. Meningitis can lead to serious nervous system problems, deafness,    seizures , paralysis of the arms or legs, or    learning difficulties .  Signs and symptoms of meningitis in babies and children Get medical attention right away if your child has any of these signs:\t Newborns  may have symptoms of    fever , decreased appetite, listlessness, or increased crying or irritability. The signs can be subtle, so it is better to call for medical advice.\t Infants and young children  may have symptoms of fever, vomiting, decreased appetite, excessive crankiness and sleepiness, and a rash. Seizures along with a fever may be the first signs of meningitis. Note that    febrile seizures  have similar symptoms. \t Older children  may complain of a    headache , back pain, a stiff neck and may be sensitive to bright light. A purple rash may also appear on any part of the skin; however it stands out most on the lower legs and feet, forearms and hands. With early diagnosis and proper treatment, 7 out of 10 children who get bacterial meningitis recover without any complications. Meningitis can lead to serious nervous system problems, deafness,    seizures , paralysis of the arms or legs, or    learning difficulties . Testing and treatment for meningitis If your child has symptoms of meningitis, it is important to see a doctor right away. Meningitis can quickly become serious or deadly. It must be detected early and treated aggressively. Lab tests are used to diagnose meningitis. This involves taking samples of blood, swabbing the nose or throat, or taking fluid from around the spinal cord (also called a spinal tap or lumbar puncture). To draw fluid, a special needle is inserted into your child's lower back. Testing of this fluid can help determine whether your child has meningitis. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial meningitis.  Most people who have viral meningitis get better in 7 to 10 days. A child with a mild infection usually can recover at home with rest, fluids and over-the-counter pain medications.  Vaccines to protect against bacterial meningitis Vaccines help protect against some types of bacterial meningitis. They help prevent all but one of the most common types of  Neisseria meningitidis  bacteria (types A, B, C, W and Y, but not X) known to cause meningococcal disease around the world.\t Haemophilus influenzae  type b (Hib) and pneumococcal vaccines can help prevent some other causes of bacterial meningitis. And, the measles, mumps, influenza and chickenpox (varicella) vaccines can help protect your child from less-common causes of viral meningitis.  Make sure your child receives the recommended vaccines by talking to their pediatrician.

        "content": "​​​​​​​​​​Roughly 39 million people in the United States suffer from migraines. While they most often strike adults, many children also experience intense, throbbing headaches and other symptoms of migraines. Read on for helpful information about the signs, symptoms and causes of migraines and how to help children and teens dealing with them. What is the difference between a migraine and a hea​dache?  Migraine pain usually is more severe. It often includes throbbing on one side of the head that often worsens with activity. Migraine headaches also tend to strike with other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, vision problems (seeing spots or flashing lights, for example), light and sound sensitivity, and tingling.   At what age can children get m​igraines?    Any child can get a migraine. About 10% of children age 5-15 and up to 28% of teens get them. Half of people who get migraines have their first attack before age of 12. Migraines have even been reported in children as young as 18 months! ​​​​Childhood mi​​​grai​nes: a coli​c connection?​\t   Recent research suggests that children who had colic as babies may be more prone to develop migraines. One study found children with migraines were seven times more likely to have been colicky infants.​​ What are some migraine causes, risk factors and ​triggers?\t Family history.  Migraines tend to run in fam​ilies. If one parent has migraines, there is roughly 50% chance that their child will too. If both parents have them, the chance is close to 90%.  \t Gender.  Before      puberty , boys have more migraines than girls. That flips in the teen years and by age 17, as many as 8% of boys and 23% of girls have had a migraine.  For adults, migraines are more common in women. \t Stress & sleep.  Irregular sleep schedules – getting too much or too little sleep – can be migraine triggers.  So are changes in      stress  levels.   \t Exercise.   While exercise can sometimes trigger migraines,      regular exercise  may help prevent or reduce the number of attacks.  \t Food & fluids.  Skipping meals and eating certain foods and      additives  can set off migraines. Common triggers include aged cheeses and meats, chocolate, citrus fruits, red and yellow food dyes,      monosodium glutamate  (MSG), and the      artificial sweetener  aspartame. Too much caffeine and spicy foods can also trigger migraines, but sometimes help headaches because they act as vasodilators and expand blood vessels. Not drinking enough water and other      beverages  can cause dehydration, another migraine trigger. \t Weather.  Stormy weather with changes in barometric pressure, extreme heat or cold, bright sunlight and glare, high humidity or very dry air all can be triggers.  Are there differen​​t stages of migraines?  Migraines often develop in stages: \t Premonitory or warning phase : tiredness, stiff neck, mood changes (can last up to 24 hours). \t   Aura : seeing spots, squiggly lines, dizziness, weakness, numbness and/or confusion. These symptoms, which don't happen with all types of migraines, may last up to an hour. \t Headache or attack : severe, throbbing/pulsating pain with nausea, vomiting and light sensitivity. \t Resolution:  sleep ends the headache pain for some children. \t Recovery : feeling tired (lasts hours to days).  How is a m​igraine diagnosed?  The      diagnosis of a migraine​  is usually based on a thorough medical history along with physical and neurological exams. Occasionally, tests like bloodwork, MRI or lumbar punctures may be recommended.  ​Mild, m​ode​​rate ​or s​​evere?​\t   To measure how strongly migraines impact a child's school, home, and social activities, pediatricians and pediatric neurologists use a tool called the Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment (PedMIDAS), which consists of 6 questions:\t In the last three months, how many...​\t   Full days of school were missed due to headaches? Partial days of school were missed due to headaches? Days did you function at less than half your ability in school because of a headache? Days were you not able to do things at home (e.g., chores, homework, etc.)? Days you did not participate in other activities due to headache (e.g., play, go out, sports, etc.)? ​​Days did you participate in these activities, but functioned at less than half your abilities?\t The total number of days are then added up. A score of less than 10 is considered little or no impact; 11-30 is mild; 31-50 is moderate, and more than 50 is severe. How are mig​​raines treated? \t Lifestyle changes.  Keeping healthy,  regular  routines  can help  prevent or reduce the frequency and severity of migraines:   \t Sleep hygiene.  Children, especially those with migraines, should get 8-10 hours of sleep daily. If your child has trouble  sleeping , your pediatrician may recommend tests to monitor for snoring or sleep disorders, which have been linked to migraines.  Make sure TVs, cell phones, tablets and other         media devices  are turned off an hour before bedtime, since they can interfere with sleep.  ​         Healthy diet.  Eat three regular meals each day at consistent times.  Avoid heavily processed foods, which tend contain more migraine triggers like additives and artificial colors and sweeteners. Drink plenty of water and other healthy beverages to stay hydrated.  ​Helpful tip: keep a headach​e d​iar​y\t   If your child has migraines, keeping a                     headache diary  can help you start to recognize triggers and see which therapies are most helpful. Simply write down when the headache started, where the pain was located, how severe the pain was, how long it lasted, any other symptoms, and if medications were effective. You may also want to keep track of how much sleep your child had, meals, fluids as well as weather changes and amounts of exercise and stress.​  \t Acute medications.  Your child's doctor may recommend or prescribe medications that can help during a   migraine attack. These work best when taken at the first sign of an attack. Keep in mind that      medication overuse headaches  may start if these are used daily or frequently. Examples of medicines that can help during a migraine include:  Analgesic pain medicines such as         acetaminophen  and products that combine ​acetaminophen, aspirin and caffeine, and nons​teroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as         ibuprofen  and naproxen.  \t Triptans , a category of drugs called selective serotonin receptor agonists. Evidence shows that combination sumatriptan/naproxen tablets and zolmitriptan nasal spray can stop headache pain within two hours.   \t Preventive medications.  There are some medications that when taken daily can help reduce the severity and/or frequency of migraines .  These tend to be “off-label,\" meaning they are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for migraines. Their risks and benefits should be discussed with your doctor. Options include:  Cardiovascular drugs: propranolol  Antidepressants drugs: amitriptyline  Anti-seizure drugs: topiramate  Antihistamines: cyproheptadine  ​Do Botox treatments help children with Migraines? ​​​ Although botulinum toxin (Botox) is approved and shown to be effective for adults who get chronic migraines, a recent American Academy of Neurology                     report  found that it is not effective for children and teens.\t   Are there any alternative therapies​​ shown to help migraines?  There are some alternative or      natural  and non-pharmaceutical approaches to migraine treatment that may help. These include: \t Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) , which focuses on coping skills, positive thinking, sticking to healthy habits, and relaxation techniques to help ease migraine pain. Research also has found that CBT combined with migraine medications is more helpful in treating migraines that medication alone.   \t Herbs, vitamins and minerals.  Certain extracts and supplements may help with migraines, although some should be avoided for safety reasons. Talk with your child's doctor before using any herbal or vitamin supplements. Common supplements include:  Feverfew: this plant contains parthenolide, which some small studies suggest may help prevent migraines in some people. However, the evidence remains mixed.  Riboflavin (vitamin B-2), coenzyme Q10 and magnesium supplements may decrease the frequency of migraines.  Butterbur extract: plant containing petasins is         NOT recommended  because of long-term liver disease risk.  How can I help my child avoid missing s​​chool from migraines?  Children who suffer from migraines are      absent from school  twice as often as other students. Talk with your child's teachers and school nurse about ways to help avoid missed class time. A letter from the doctor explaining your child's diagnosis and the medications they take when they feel a migraine coming on can help the conversation. Helpful      accommodations  may include making sure your child has ready access to water and snacks, for example.

        "content": "By: Elizabeth Mayne, MD, PhD, FAAP & Courtney Wusthoff, MD, MS, FAAP \"Stroke\" is an injury to the brain or the blood vessels in the brain. If a blood vessel is blocked, it can't deliver oxygen or nutrients to the brain.  Unlike other parts of the body, the brain cannot survive for long without blood flow – if an area of the brain runs out of oxygen or energy, it can become injured or even die. This is an \"ischemic stroke.\" A \"venous sinus thrombosis\" happens when a blood clot forms in one of the veins in the head. Another type is a \"hemorrhagic stroke,\" which is bleeding inside the head.\t Stroke is an emergency—if you think your child is having a stroke, call 911! Children have strokes? Strokes are less common in babies and kids than in adults, but they do happen! Babies have a higher risk than children or teenagers.  What causes a stroke in children? Children have strokes for different reasons than adults.      Premature  babies may have brain bleeds because their blood vessels are very fragile. Babies have blood that clots more easily than older kids, which can cause stroke in the weeks around birth.  Blood diseases, like      sickle cell  or hemophilia, can also cause stroke. Genetic diseases that affect the blood vessels or the blood can cause stroke in kids of any age. Other children might have a stroke after injuries to the head or neck if they damage the blood vessels inside. Rarely, infections can create narrowing of the blood vessels in the brain and cause a stroke. Children with heart problems are also at risk.  What are common symptoms of stroke? Sometimes, it is hard to tell if a child is having a stroke because babies and younger kids can't always tell us what's happening.  In infants: seizures that keep happening in one part of the body sleepiness that is so severe that a baby won't wake up to feed normally weakness or stiffness on one side of the body or in one arm or leg. One sign can be a hand preference before your baby turns one. Other children may have developmental delays.  In children: sudden weakness on one side of the face and body, or not using one side of the body normally falling to one side repeatedly new difficulty talking - slurred speech (\"like they are drunk\"), no words coming out, or words that do not make sense loss of feeling in one side of the body or face vertigo (\"feeling like the room is spinning or moving\") with balance problems and difficulty walking or double vision sudden, very bad            headache  that is different from your child's normal headaches  How is stroke diagnosed? If you think a child is having a stroke,      call 911  or go to your nearest emergency department.  A doctor will talk to you and examine your child. Depending on what they see, your child may have some of these tests: pictures of your child's brain and of the blood vessels in the head and neck with a CT or an MRI scan heart tests including an            EKG  or an ultrasound picture of the heart (an \"echocardiogram\") to see how well it is working blood tests to look for bleeding or clotting problems, infections, or blood conditions.  How is stroke treated? In some cases, emergency treatment may be possible to stop the stroke from getting worse if a diagnosis is made within the first hours after a stroke starts. If your child had an ischemic stroke or a venous thrombosis, doctors may use aspirin or blood thinners to prevent it from getting worse or happening again. For children with brain bleeds, a neurosurgeon will work closely with your doctor to help take care of your child. How does my child recover from a stroke? The most important treatments for children with strokes are time and physical, occupational or speech therapy. Even though the brain does not heal as easily or as completely as other parts of the body, children's brains can often adapt to their injuries. Through physical, speech, and occupational therapy, many kids can continue to improve for 6 or even 12 months after their stroke. Your child's doctor and therapists will work with you to make a plan for how to best help her recover.  Can this happen again? Overall, the risk for another stroke in childhood is low. All of us are at risk for stroke as we age, so it is important for you and your child to avoid things that increase the risk of stroke in adulthood, like high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking.

        "content": "​Understanding the risks and benefits of different birth control methods is important for all women. For women with a congenital heart defect (CHD), choosing the right  birth control  is critical to maintaining a healthy heart.   Questions to Ask Yourself: Selecting birth control when you have a CHD requires you to think about all aspects of your life.  Some typical questions might be: Do I ever want to become pregnant? If so, when might that be?  Will pregnancy be too risky with my heart condition?    Some women with a CHD have a very high risk for medical complications if they become pregnant. If this is you, it is important to use a very effective form of birth control or to consider permanent sterilization. If pregnancy could be dangerous to your health but you would like to have a family, talk to your doctor about other options, such as adoption or surrogacy. Deciding not to have children is a perfectly acceptable option, too, if that is what you choose. Types of Birth Control: Women with a CHD who are able to have a safe or low risk pregnancy but are not ready to become pregnant yet have many options for birth control.  Some methods are more effective than others and some also last longer than others.  Some methods contain the hormones estrogen and/or progesterone (e.g. oral medications, skin patches, vaginal rings, implants). Some forms of birth control use a \"barrier\" method to block sperm from entering the uterus (e.g. condoms, copper intrauterine devices or IUDs, diaphragms). Benefits & Risks of Birth Control Methods: There are different risks and success rates for the various forms of birth control. Condoms  ​have little physical risk to women. They are also highly effective at protecting against  sexually transmitted diseases . However, they do not always work well at preventing pregnancy. In fact, they have a failure rate as high as 30%. Birth control pills  are usually reliable at preventing pregnancy. However, some forms bith control pills contain estrogen which can increase the risk of stroke and other medical complications related to the increased risk of blood clots. Estrogen is not recommended if you have a CHD and are at increased risk of forming blood clots, especially if you have an artificial heart valve or have had a Fontan operation. Progesterone-only birth control methods  have a lower risk of blood clots. Progesterone can be taken as a pill, placed as an implant under the skin, given as monthly injections or used in an IUD. A progesterone pill must be taken at the same time every day. Progesterone forms of birth control are often good choices if you have a CHD. They can be highly effective when they are used the right way.  Progesterone IUD  is a very effective method if you do not want to become pregnant for at least a few years.    Two forms of birth control are recommended  if you are sure you never want to become pregnant or are at very high risk for a dangerous pregnancy. You may consider a tubal ligation or other permanent form of birth control, as well. If you have a long-term male partner, you may consider asking him to have a vasectomy.    Talk to your gynecologist about which form of birth control is best for you based on the recommendations of your congenital cardiologist.  ​ ​ Additional Information & Resources:  Sexually Transmitted Infections Prevention Sexuality Education for Children and Adolescents  (AAP Clinical Report) Birth Control Methods Fact Sheet  (WomensHealth.gov)​ Additional information regarding congenital heart defects and lifelong cardiac care is available at the Congenital Heart Public Health Consortium (CHPHC) website,  www.chphc.org .

        "content": "By: Shahnawaz Amdani, MD, FACC, FAAP & Majd Makhoul, MD, FAAP, FACC, FASE Rare and often underdiagnosed, cardiomyopathy is one of the common causes of    sudden cardiac death  in children under the age of 18. Because the disease can be present without symptoms, families should be aware of any family members who have    heart disease  or who die unexpectedly before age 50. Here's what else you need to know about cardiomyopathy in children, teens and young adults. What is cardiomyopathy? Cardiomyopathy is a chronic heart condition that involves the deterioration of the heart muscle (myocardium). The heart muscle becomes abnormally shaped, thickened and/or stiffened.  Eventually the heart is unable to pump effectively and cannot supply the body with enough blood to function. In severe cases, cardiomyopathy can lead to heart failure or sudden death. There are 5 forms of cardiomyopathy: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARCM) Left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) Who gets cardiomyopathy? Cardiomyopathy predominantly affects adults, but may also affect infants and children. According to the  North American Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry , 1 to 1.5 out of 100,000 children in the U.S. is diagnosed with cardiomyopathy each year. This is a conservative number, though, because it does not include all types of cardiomyopathies. Cardiomyopathy can occur in any child regardless of age, gender, race, or economic background. Causes of cardiomyopathy in children There are many causes of cardiomyopathy in children, including some that are not fully understood. Common causes include:\t Inheriting  the condition from one or both parents A viral infection Some congenital and acquired cardiac abnormalities  Effect of    chemotherapy  drugs  Metabolic, mitochondrial, or systemic diseases in parts of the body other than the heart Persistent arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) Toxins affecting other organs  Despite advances in    genetic testing , the exact cause remains unknown in two-thirds of diagnosed children. Symptoms of pediatric cardiomyopathy Occasionally, symptoms of pediatric cardiomyopathy can be mistaken as a cold, flu, asthma attack, or stomachache. Some affected children have no symptoms while others may experience any of the following symptoms: Shortness of breath or rapid breathing Dizziness and    fainting  \t Irregular  or rapid heartbeat Abdominal bloating or swelling Chest pain Extreme fatigue Infants may experience poor weight gain, extreme sleepiness, difficulty feeding or excessive sweating. Warning signs of sudden cardiac arrest: Recognizing the warning signs of sudden cardiac arrest is also important. If your child experiences any of the following, he or she should see a pediatric cardiologist for an extensive cardiac evaluation: Chest pain or discomfort during physical activity Fainting or near fainting without warning or during physical activity \t Seizure  without warning or during physical activity Excessive fatigue associated with exercise Unusually fast heart rate or rhythm with an unknown cause How is pediatric cardiomyopathy diagnosed? A    pediatric cardiologist  confirms the diagnosis through an    echocardiogram  (echo) and    electrocardiogram  (EKG, or ECG). In some cases, other medical tests are necessary. Genetic testing may be recommended to investigate the underlying cause. Since pediatric cardiomyopathy is rare, it is recommended to locate a children's medical center with a wide range of experience in managing children with cardiomyopathy. Early diagnosis and treatment of the disease is essential to preventing complications and progression to heart failure. Treatment options for cardiomyopathy There is no cure for cardiomyopathy yet, but the disease is treatable. Symptoms and complications can be well-controlled by medications, surgery, and/or implantable devices. The type of cardiomyopathy and its severity determines the treatment plan. It is important to talk to a cardiomyopathy specialist to determine the best treatment course for your child.\t Medication  is usually the first treatment option to improve the functioning of the heart.\t An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)  may be needed in children with irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmia). \t A surgical procedure called a myectomy  may relieve symptoms in children with HCM.\t A ventricular assist device and heart transplant  may be necessary if medical management is ineffective in children with advanced heart failure. Genetic screening for cardiomyopathy Cardiomyopathy is often genetic, so it is important to consider a family's inheritance risk and discuss family screening. A pediatric cardiologist and a    pediatric geneticist  should work together to form a screening plan and discuss genetic testing options with your family. How does a cariomyopathy diagnosis impact a child's lifestyle?    Although cardiomyopathy is a chronic condition, many children with cardiomyopathy lead a relatively normal life with few limitations. A diagnosis will likely involve more visits to the cardiologist and taking daily medications.  Other adjustments may include diet changes and school accommodations. Restriction from competitive or contact  sports  may be needed in a few cases, but these need to be made using a collaborative shared decision-making model between the patient, parent and pediatric cardiomyopathy specialist.

        "content": "​​​​The first thing most parents want to know about their unborn baby is whether the baby is healthy. From the moment parents hear the words,  \" Your child has a heart defect ,\"  they are thrust into a world they were not expecting.   Even before the child is born, the joy of giving birth is often couple d with so many unique and complicated feelings—ranging from fear, guilt, sadness, shame, and confusion. Many feel ashamed of these feelings and try to suppress them, but it is important to remember these feelings are common and expected. About Congenital Heart Defects Congenital Heart Disease (CHD)  is the most common type of birth defect affecting 8 out of every 1,000 newborns.   Each year, about 35,000 babies in the Unites States are diagnosed with CHD. Nearly 25% of those are  critical congenital heart defects —ones that require surgery or other interventions within the first year of life to survive. Parents of these children often sit by their child's side in the hospital hoping and praying their child survives.  As a result of dramatic advances in the medical and surgical management of CHD, 85% of infants with CHD are now expected to survive to adulthood, and CHD is regarded as a chronic disease rather than a terminal one. However, survival rates for children with critical congenital heart defects is lower; they often need specialized medical care throughout their lifetime.   Understanding Unique Parenting Challenges All parents are caregivers, but parents of children with CHD have extra challenges.  Learning \"normal\" and more specialized parenting skills: Aside from the typical stresses and adjustments new parents face, in most cases, parents who have a baby with CHD are also struggling to care for a baby who may have spent months in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and may have tubes or attachments to his or her tiny body.  When babies have open-heart surgeries, their ability to learn to eat can be compromised. Some babies have to be fed through a feeding tube. In addition to feeding issues, many children with CHD have trouble gaining weight and must go on special high-calorie diets.  Becoming an expert and advocate.  Knowledge is power. Parents often immerse themselves into learning as much as they possibly can about their child's diagnosis, medication, and treatment plan. It is important to avoid \"internet overload\" by sticking to reputable websites.  See the additional resources at the end of this article.    Making changes to safeguard their child's health: Infants and children with CHD have weaker immune systems than the average child. They can end up in the hospital for illnesses that others recover from on their own. Thus, many parents take extra precautions to try to keep their child healthy. This may mean having serious talks with friends and family about getting their annual flu shot and a Tdap shot to prevent whooping cough.  See  How to Cocoon a Newborn: Only an E-Mail Away!  for more information and tips.   As their child grows, parents must strike a balance between letting their child live \"normally\" and protecting them. Walking the line between healthy limits and over-protectiveness is an ongoing concern.  Struggling with the financial component of care:  For a child with CHD, surgical costs can be astronomical, even with health insurance. The costs of medicines and doctor appointments add up quickly, too. Many children with CHD are on multiple medications, some taken several times a day. It's not unusual for children who've had open-heart surgery to come home on six or more different medications.  Caring for their other children: If there are siblings in the family, parents must also take their needs into consideration. Young children, especially, may have fears and anxieties about their brother or sister's condition that they aren't voicing. It is important to spend one-on-one time with each child and time together as a family that isn't focused on the CHD. Educating the school and others:  Often, sending a child with CHD to preschool or school, or even having siblings in school, can pose challenges for parents. Again, avoiding major illnesses is a concern. Educating school staff about CHD and their child's limitations can also be difficult. Sometimes, parents get everyone together who will be working with their child, so that they all understand the condition or defect.  Living with persistent uncertainty: Even if their child doesn't need any more procedures, there will always be doctor appointments that will inevitably dredge up some old memories and new fears. As children grow, it is also natural for parents to feel fear about the inherent risks of CHD and the knowns and unknowns about their child's  lifelong care . The journey is never over, so support plays a big role in these parents' lives.  Why Support is So Important Parents need for all kinds of support – informational, emotional, and instrumental – to be able to face the stress of caring for a child with CHD.   Connecting with other parents of children with a CHD: Parents and other family members are  encouraged to connect with others  who also have a child in their family with a heart defect. Other parents, for example, can provide a credible model of how to cope in a positive way with exceptional life circumstances.  Talking to a trained mental health professional:  Parents who seek the assistance of mental health professionals typically experience reductions in stress, depression and anxiety, as well as improved sleep and life satisfaction.  The Silver Lining  Life with a child diagnosed with CHD can be overwhelming, stressful, and in some cases tragic. However, some families have recognized a silver lining in having a family member with a complex medical condition like CHD. For example, siblings can be more resilient—demonstrating increased compassion, a greater sense of wonder and joy, and a greater appreciation for life. Many parents' outlook on life and priorities can change, as well, to appreciate the \"little things in life\" a lot more.

        "content": "By: Markus S. Renno, MD, MPH, FAAP & Tim Thomas, MD, FAAP Many children say their chest hurts at some point during their growth and development.  Chest pain​  in children is rarely due to the heart. Still, you should feel free to ask your pediatrician about it to figure out the reason for the pains. Many times, the cause can be determined by answering a few questions about the discomfort and by undergoing a careful physical exam. What is the most common cause of chest pain in children? Most children complaining of chest pain have musculoskeletal chest pain, which is pain originating from the muscles or bones in the chest, and their connections. There are three common causes of musculoskeletal chest pain: A spasm or cramp of the chest wall muscles and nerves. These come and go and can be quite painful. These pains are sometimes referred to as “precordial catch syndrome\". ​Coughing really hard or often during a cold can also cause chest pains. “Costochondritis\" is pain caused by inflammation of the cartilage connecting with the bones of the chest. Musculoskeletal chest pain is not due to any problem with the heart and is not dangerous. Pain medicines like ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce any inflammation that is present. Talk to your pediatrician about      how to safely use ibuprofen  and any other pain medicines.  What else causes chest pain in children? Other common causes of chest pain include:\t Pneumonia  (lung infection) can cause irritation around the lungs that can be quite painful, especially with breathing. This is sometimes called pleurisy. Children sometimes describe their breathing difficulties from            asthma  as chest pain. Acid reflux from the stomach up into the esophagus can burn and feel painful. This is called            gastroesophageal reflux disease  or heart burn. Some children describe emotional responses to stress and anxiety as chest “pain\". Others may complain of discomfort to gain attention. Your pediatrician may determine this as the cause of your child's chest pain by a process of elimination. In rare cases, a heart problem will cause chest pain in children.  ​Warning signs that should raise concern for a heart problem:\t   ​​Chest pain during physical exerti​​on, exercise or activity​\t Chest pain and pressure that does not go away\t Chest pain after an unexpected decrease in the ability to exercise over days to weeks\t Chest pain that is followed by                           passing out  or nearly passing out\t Chest pain in children born with                           heart defects  (congenital heart disease)\t Chest pain in children who have had                           Kawasaki disease\t Chest pain in children who have a genetic cause of                           high cholesterol\t Chest pain in children with a family member who died of unexplained reasons\t Chest pain in children with a family member who has                           cardiomyopathy  \t   ​What is a heart attack, and can it happen in a child?\t The coronary arteries are tiny arteries that wrap around the heart to bring oxygen to the heart muscle. When these get blocked for any reason, the heart does not get enough oxygen. This is what is commonly referred to as a heart attack.  It is very unusual for a child to have a heart attack, unless they have an abnormal coronary artery course or origin, or disease of the heart muscle. Examples of these include: Hypertrophic            cardiomyopathy  is an abnormality of the heart muscle that makes it very thick. This is present in about 1 out of 200 people. Because of how thick the muscle is, it sometimes needs more oxygen than the coronary arteries are able to provide. Not only does this injure the muscle, but over time, it also puts the heart at risk of an            abnormal heart rhythm , which can be life-threatening. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of            sudden cardiac death  in young athletes in the United States. About 1 out of 100 people are born with a coronary artery that starts in an unusual place. In rare cases, this abnormality can cause life-threatening symptoms. An abnormal coronary artery is the second most common cause of sudden cardiac death in children in the United States. This is why chest pain that occurs caused by exercise is a red flag. Children with a history of congenital            heart defects ,            Kawasaki disease , and genetic causes of            high cholesterol  are at higher risk than others for having a heart attack from blockage of a coronary artery. Ask your pediatrician if any of these apply to your child. Myocarditis happens when the immune system causes damage to the heart muscle. This often occurs while it is fighting an infection by a virus. Myocarditis can be life-threatening and result in poor heart function and            abnormal heart rhythms . Fortunately, myocarditis is very rare in children, happening in about 1 out of 100,000 children each year. Remember Talk with your pediatrician about any concerns you have about your child's health.

The cause of a heart defect is most often unknown. Some defects may be small and may cause your child few problems; others are life-threatening. Types of Congenital Heart Defects There are 18 types of congenital heart defects recognized and ​many additional anatomic variations. The more common heart defects are listed below:​   Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) Atrioventricular Canal Defect Coarctation of the Aorta (CoA) Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS) Pulmonary Atresia Pulmonary Stenosis (PS) Tetralogy of Fallot Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection (TAPVC) Transposition of the Great Arteries Tricuspid Atresia Truncus Arteriosus Ventricular Septal Defect Outlook for Children Born with a Heart Defect Even if your baby is born with a heart defect, it is very likely nowadays that he or she can live a normal adult life and overcome the problem. The many advances in the diagnosis and treatment have made it possible to correct defects via  surgery  and heart catheterization .  Even the most difficult cases have hope now.

        "content": "By: Meena Bolourchi, MD, FAAP  What should you expect when you or your child goes to see a      pediatric cardiologist ?  There are a number of special tests pediatric cardiologists may do to learn more about your child's heart. Read each section below to learn more about each specific test. Routine Studies in the Office:  Electrocardiogram  An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a quick test using stickers on the chest, arms, and legs to measure the electrical activity of the heart. This test is useful for the detection of heart rhythm abnormalities as well as enlargement of the heart chambers.  Echocardiogram An echocardiogram is an ultrasound movie of the inside the heart―like the ultrasounds done during pregnancy. Images are obtained by placing an ultrasound probe on the chest, the belly, and the neck to see the heart from every angle. A first-time echocardiogram can be lengthy, so be prepared for it to take up to 30-60 minutes. Fortunately, echocardiograms can detect most congenital heart defects or problems of the heart muscle function. Ambulatory Heart Monitors:  Holter Monitor\t A Holter monitor is a small machine that records your child's heartbeat for a 24-hour to 48-hour period at home. There are 3 to 6 stickers placed on the chest that connect to wires and a small device that can fit in your pocket. If your child has symptoms, such as chest pain or palpitations, your child (or you) can press a button on the device so that your cardiologist can pay extra attention to the heartbeats at the time of the symptoms. Event Monitor While similar to the Holter monitor, the Event monitor is different in that it can be worn for one month at home. Just like the Holter monitor, there are up to six stickers placed on the chest. This device records the heartbeats whenever your child has symptoms and presses the button. This test is useful if your child's symptoms occur less frequently, such as a few times a month.  Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor An ambulatory blood pressure monitor is a type of blood pressure cuff that can be worn at home for 24 hours to measure blood pressure multiple times a day. Every blood pressure is recorded and is shown to your child's cardiologist when the monitor is returned. This information is helpful to differentiate between a nervous child who has a high blood pressure in the doctor's office versus a child who truly has high blood pressure. Further Imaging Studies:  Chest X-rays The chest X-ray gives the pediatric cardiologist information about your child's lungs and the heart's size and shape. The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is extremely small and doesn't cause any long-term side effects. Cardiac MRI MRI is another way to take pictures of the heart and measure function. It also avoids radiation and uses a painless, giant magnet to take high-resolution pictures of the heart in motion over about 30-60 minutes.  Children under age 6 often need anesthesia to lay still for up to 1 hour.  Older children and young adults can typically do the 1-hour test without anesthesia, as they can take a nap or watch a movie while in the scanner.  Babies in the first couple months of life can do a \"feed and wrap\" test where they avoid needing anesthesia by falling asleep after being fed and wrapped in a blanket.   Patients who have metal in their body, such as dental braces, may not be able to do this test due to the magnet.  Cardiac CT  A cardiac CT (also known as a CAT scan) is a fast, painless imaging study that uses radiation to get detailed pictures of the anatomy of the heart and the surrounding blood vessels. Some CT scans might require contrast or dye given through an IV to so the chambers of the heart and the blood vessels light up. Your child will need to lie very still for a few minutes at a time over a 30-minute period, and younger patients sometimes need to be lightly sedated. Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) A TEE is a heart scan with an endoscopy and provides a computerized picture of the heart in action. A small wand is placed inside the esophagus (food pipe) to get a closer look at the heart. This test is usually done before and after open heart surgery, or if certain structures were not seen well on a traditional echocardiogram. Children receive some type of sedation for this test and are not able to eat or drink for up to 8 hours prior the study.  Stress Testing: Exercise Stress Testing The exercise stress test involves uses a treadmill or bicycle while being connected to an ECG monitor. The level of difficulty increases every few minutes, and the test stop whenever you get tired. A pediatric cardiologist may recommend this test for schoolage children or young adults if they have chest pain, trouble breathing, or fainting with exercise.  Stress Echocardiogram An echocardiogram compares the function of the heart at rest versus under stress. It is done immediately after exercising on a treadmill or bicycle. If a child is are unable to exercise, a medication such as dobutamine can be used to create the same effect on the heart as exercise. Interventional Cardiac Procedures: Cardiac Catheterization A catheter or wire is inserted in the blood vessel(s) of the groin and/or neck to reach the heart. This way, the blood pressure and oxygen level of each chamber of the heart can be measured directly and your child's cardiologist can make decisions about the next best steps in care. It is also possible to do interventions during the catheterization. For example, if a heart valve or a blood vessel is too small, a balloon can be inflated, or a stent can be placed to make that structure bigger. In order to take pictures of the heart during the procedure, contrast or dye may be injected and then a video of your child's heart in action is taken using a type of x-ray radiation called      fluoroscopy . After the catheterization, the small catheter tubes and IV line are removed and a bandage is placed over the area. This procedure may require your child to stay overnight in the hospital for further monitoring.  Electrophysiology Study For children with arrhythmias or abnormal heart rhythms, an electrophysiology (EP) study can be used to find the area within the heart that is sending the abnormal signals. This test is performed by a pediatric electrophysiologist, a pediatric cardiologist with special training in the electrical conduction system of the heart in children. The EP study is done during a heart catheterization and usually with general anesthesia or sedation. Catheters are inserted into the blood vessel(s) of the groin and/or neck to reach the heart to create an electrical map of the heart. Once the location of the abnormal signal is found, the pediatric electrophysiologist can either burn or freeze the trouble area to get rid of the arrhythmia altogether. An EP study can take from 4 to 6 hours to complete, and your child will may need to stay overnight in the hospital.

        "content": "Healthy teeth and gums are important for everyone―especially for children with heart conditions.  Young children with  congenital heart defects (CHD)  are at greater risk for  tooth decay  because their baby teeth may have weak enamel. Children with cyanotic heart disease may have weaker teeth due to poor oxygenation. Cardiac medications that may cause dry mouth can also increase risk for cavities. There are complicated background factors often associated with nutrition, medication, and the demanding situation of these children's families that all play a part in their dental health.  What's the connection between your teeth and your heart?  Did you know in the middle of each tooth is a blood vessel?  Our teeth and our heart share the same blood―meaning the same bacteria that can lead to cavities in teeth can travel to the heart and cause a dangerous infection called  endocarditis . Children with artificial valves or other prosthetic materials and those with cyanosis are especially susceptible.  What is  endocarditis ?  Endocarditis  is an infection that occurs when germs enter the bloodstream and travel to the heart. Certain types of bacteria are the cause in most cases. Although rare, it is a very serious condition requiring hospitalization and long treatment. The best way to reduce the risk of  endocarditis  is to look after teeth and gums. A healthy mouth and teeth are also thought to protect the body from other illnesses.  Endocarditis  and other infections can also occur after damage to or cutting the skin, such as having oral  piercings , so it is recommended that these are avoided.  What can I do to help protect my child's health?  Prevention is the best medicine, and there is much you can do to prevent cavities!  Daily care and  regular dental visits  beginning at 12 months of age are the keystones to good oral health.  Finding a pediatric dentist is the first step.  Your child's cardiologist may have a recommendation for a pediatric dentist who has experience treating children with heart conditions and can tell you whether your child requires antibiotics for routine cleanings or other procedures. You can also ask your child's cardiologist about any additional considerations for your child's dental visits, such as the use of  sedation or anesthesia . Talk with your child's dentist before the appointment.  Discuss your child's diagnosis and any medications he or she takes. Certain drugs such as aspirin, Warfarin, and other blood thinners may complicate dental treatment. However, dental treatment is safe with the appropriate precautions. Ask your child's dentist to contact your child's cardiologist to coordinate care and decide whether your child should have any medication changes before any dental procedure.  Preventing tooth decay starts in the home . Reduce the amount of sugar your child  eats  and drinks to keep bacteria from starting the decay process. Good oral hygiene, such as regular brushing in the morning and before going to sleep and flossing, are great ways to remove the acid made by the bacteria that causes decay. Your child's dentist will have suggestions for other ways to keep your child's teeth healthy.

        "content": "By: Orhan Kilinc, MD, FAAP, and Christopher S. Snyder, MD, FAAP   The heart is one of the most active muscles in the body, beating some 50 million times in a child's first year of life. It's normal for a child's heartbeat to speed up or slows down as they play, sleep and grow.  But what if your child's heartbeat seems faster or slower than it should be, or has an unusual pattern? In this article, the American Academy of Pediatrics describes normal heart rate fluctuations in kids, and what might be cause for concern.  Reasons for irregular heartbeats\t Ordinarily, special \"pacemaker\" cells in the heart send electrical impulses from upper to lower chambers (atria and ventricles), which take turns squeezing and relaxing to pump blood throughout the body. There are many factors that can influence this rhythm. These include    physical activity , stress or excitement, for example.  Fever ,  dehydration , and medical conditions like    anemia  can also play a role. So can certain medications or consuming    energy drinks  and other caffeine-containing beverages. In addition, some children are born with    congenital conditions  that affect the heart's muscles or electrical pathways and the way it pumps. Irregular heartbeats that are usually normal  Irregular heartbeats, also called arrhythmias, are a common reason for referral to a pediatric cardiologist. Most often, these irregularities turn out to be perfectly normal. Examples of these common but usually harmless arrhythmias include: \t Respiratory sinus arrhythmia  - the most common irregular heart rate in children. It's caused by the normal change in how fast blood returns to the heart when they breath in or out. The heart beats faster when they inhale, and slower when they exhale. The name \"arrhythmia\" is actually misleading, since this variation in heartbeats occurs in all healthy children in varying degrees. \t Premature or \"skipped\" heart beats  - seen in up to 75% of pediatric patients. These irregular beats may start in either the top chambers (premature atrial contractions) or the bottom chambers (premature ventricular contractions) of the heart. Patients feel like their heart \"skipped\" a beat due to a pause in the rhythm followed by a more forceful beat.  Normal Heart Rate Range for Children & Teens\t   Variations in a child's heart rate is normal. Generally, though, a child's heart rates slows as they get older. For example, a heart rate of 130 to 150 beats per minute is normal for a newborn infant, but it would be considered fast for a school age child. An athletic teenager may have a heart rate of 50 at rest but could have heart rate of 180 during heavy exercise.\t   To check your child's pulse or heart rate, gently feel for a slight beat inside the wrist, the crook of the elbow, or side of neck. Count beats for 15 seconds, and then multiply by 4.\t \t  A ge Awake Rate  (beats per minute)  Sleeping (beats per minute) newborn  100 to 205  90 to 160  infant  100 to 180  90 to 160  1- to 2-years old  98 to 140  80 to 120  3- to 5-years old  80 to 120  65 to 100  6- to 7-years old  75 to 118  58 to 90  Adolescent  60 to 100  50 to 90  Irregular heart rhythms that may need evaluation & treatment  There are other types of irregular heartbeats that may need be treated or monitored. These include:   Abnormally fast heartbeats \t Supraventricular tachycardia  (SVT)   is the most common abnormal pediatric heart rhythm, affecting as many as 1 in 250 children. It happens when electrical signals in the upper chambers of the heart misfire and cause a sudden burst of abnormally fast, \"racing\" heartbeats that last for seconds, minutes or longer. About half of children with SVT, sometimes called atrial tachycardia, are diagnosed as infants. Episodes of SVT usually go away by a child's first birthday, although it can return.      There are different types and causes of SVT, including: \t Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome  affects children born with an extra electrical pathway in the heart. That extra pathway may allow impulses to move in a different direction and faster than usual. Atrial flutter & atrial fibrillation  happens when electrical signals from the upper chamber of the heart are faster than those in the lower chamber, causing the heart to flutter rather than fully squeezing for a regular beat. Atrial fibrillation is another type of abnormally fast, quivering heart rhythm that is similar to atrial flutter, but the abnormally fast beats are less regular. These conditions make it difficult for the heart to pump blood effectively and increases the risk of problems like blood clots. Both are much less common than other types of SVT. Research suggests they may be inherited genetically or linked to    congenital heart abnormalities  or heart muscle disorders like    cardiomyopathy . \t Ventricular tachycardia  (VT) is a series of heartbeats starting in the lower chambers of the heart, rather than the upper chambers like normal, that cause an abnormally fast rhythm. It is rare in children, but early identification can be lifesaving since it can raise the risk of    sudden cardiac arrest . One type of VT is    Long QT syndrome , an inherited condition that affects an estimated 1 in 2,500 people. It causes the lower chambers of the heart to take too long to contract and release, causing a fast and chaotic heart rhythm.   Abnormally slow heartbeat  Bradycardia  – when the heart rate is below the normal low range for a child's age. In children, two of the most common types are: \t Sinus bradycardia  is seen more often in premature infants. Possible causes include medications the baby was exposed to before birth, breathing problems or a drop in body temperature called    hypothermia .\t Heart block  is when electrical signals are prevented from passing from the upper to lower chambers of the heart. The condition often is caused by structural problems in the heart that affect the atrioventricular (AV) node, a cluster of specialized heart cells in the right atrium that act as a natural \"pacemaker.\" Signs & symptoms of an abnormal heart rhythm in children  Infants with abnormal heart rhythms may seem extra irritable or fussy, have feeding difficulties, appear pale, and lack energy. Older children tend to have more specific symptoms such as feeling a fluttering or pounding known as heart palpitations,    lightheadedness or fainting , chest pain or discomfort, and difficulty breathing.  How are abnormal heart rhythms diagnosed?  If your child's doctor suspects a heart rhythm problem after the physical exam, he or she will recommend    cardiac testing , which may include:  Electrocardiogram  (ECG or EKG). This fast and simple test usually is the first one recommended to check for abnormal rhythm. It is usually able to confirm a diagnosis, but sometimes additional testing may be needed.  Wearable heart monitors . If a heart rhythm problem seems to come and go, or happens only in certain settings, a wearable heart monitor may help with diagnosis. Devices such as a Holter monitor let an older child press button when they feel symptoms over the course of a day or more. The doctor can then look at what the monitor showed was happening in the heart at that moment.  Stress test.  If the abnormal heart rhythm tends to happen mostly during exercise, the doctor may order an exercise stress test. Your child rides a stationary bike or runs on a treadmill while the doctor monitors the heart rhythm.  Tilt-table test.  For children with abnormal rhythms linked to fainting, a    tilt test  can show how heart rate and blood pressure changes when a child goes from lying down to standing up.  Imaging tests.  Although uncommon, certain heart rhythm conditions may signal problems with the heart's structure. In these cases, imaging tests such as an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) may be needed.  Your pediatrician will likely refer you to a    pediatric cardiologist  for follow up. A pediatric electrophysiologist, who specializes in testing for heart rhythm disorders, may also be part of your child's care team.  Treatment for arrythmia  Although heart rhythm disorders can be worrisome, treatments and cures are available. Many heart rhythm problems can be controlled with medications. Implantable devices such as artificial pacemakers can also help keep heart rhythms regular. Other options include corrective surgery and other procedures such as    radiofrequency ablation , which uses radio waves to heat up certain heart cells in the heart to prevent them from letting electrical currents through.

        "content": "​​​​A congenital heart defect (CHD) is the most common type of  birth defect . It is estimated that 2 to 3 million people in the United States have a CHD. Over the last few decades, treatments for CHDs have improved—meaning more children born with a CHD are growing up to have children of their own.  If you have a CHD, you might wonder what the risk is for your child to also have a CHD. You might also wonder whether pregnancy will affect your health. These are very important questions to discuss with your congenital cardiologist and perhaps other specialists, such as a maternal-fetal-medicine specialist and a geneticist or genetic counselor.  What causes a congenital heart defect? CHDs are caused by genetics, the environment, or a combination of both. Some known genetic causes include: Chromosome abnormalities:  Extra or missing chromosomes. Gene mutation:  A change to the DNA sequence or order that makes up a gene. About genetic testing:  There are two types of tests used with genetic testing: chromosomal and DNA. Recent advances in these tests have made it more possible to find the genetic cause of CHDs for many patients. Sometimes, however, a genetic change cannot be identified, but the cause can still be genetic.   How to reduce your baby's risk of a congenital heart defect: If you have a CHD, your baby has a higher risk of being born with a CHD. In fact, there is about a 5% chance your child will have a CHD, too. A geneticist or genetic counselor can help you determine if genetic testing might be helpful for you prior to becoming pregnant.  See  Preconception Counseling for Women with a Congenital Heart Defect   for more information.   You might be asking yourself: What can I do to lower my baby's chance of being born with a CHD? How might I be able to improve my baby's outcome if he or she has a CHD?    These are important questions to ask your medical care team, but some research suggests taking folate prior to conception and during pregnancy may decrease the risk of a CHD.   How a congenital heart defect is diagnosed in an unborn baby: A CHD can be diagnosed very early in pregnancy (around 18 to 20 weeks) via an ultrasound of the baby's heart, called a fetal echocardiogram.   If you have a CHD caused by a genetic change, your maternal-fetal-medicine specialist can perform either an  amniocentesis  or  chorionic villus sampling  to determine whether your unborn baby has the same genetic change. Both of these tests are done by inserting a needle into the womb to get a small tissue sample for testing.

        "content": "Heredity is clearly an important risk factor for conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. However, researchers are steadily gathering strong evidence about how diet influence development of diseases. Experts agree that healthy eating habits from an early age can lower the risk of developing several deadly diseases later on. A diet designed to lower the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other serious diseases is one that benefits the whole family, adults and children alike. \t Risk Factors for Heart Disease \t Heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States and most industrialized countries. The chief risk factors are:\t Smoking\t High blood pressure\t Diabetes\t High blood level of cholesterol\t Physical inactivity\t Obesity  \t Family history  of early-onset heart disease\t Following a Heart-Healthy Diet From an Early Age \t American children and adolescents, on average, eat more  saturated fat  and have higher blood cholesterol levels than young people their age in most other developed countries. The rate of heart disease tends to keep pace with cholesterol levels. One study found early signs of hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) in 7% of children between ages 10 and 15 years, and the rate was twice as high between ages 15 and 20. \t According to the  American Heart Association , a heart-healthy diet from an early age lowers cholesterol and if followed through adolescence and beyond, should reduce the risk of coronary artery disease in adulthood.\t All children older than 2 years should follow a heart-healthy diet, including  low-fat  dairy products. For children between the ages of 12 months and 2 years with a family history of obesity, abnormal blood fats, or cardiovascular disease, reduced-fat milk should be considered.\t Is There a Family History?\t When you and your children first saw your pediatrician, you were probably asked if there was a history of heart or vascular disease in your family. If your children were young, their grandparents were probably relatively young as well and may not have had a  heart attack  or stroke (even though they may have been headed for one). If heart disease in the grandparents becomes apparent later on, be sure to bring it to your pediatrician’s attention at the next checkup. \t Cholesterol Testing for Adopted Children  \t Complete biological family medical histories are not usually available to  adopted children  and their parents, even for those adopted in open proceedings. To prevent the development of diseases linked to high blood cholesterol levels, adopted children should be screened periodically for blood lipid (fat) levels throughout childhood. \t Additional Information  \t Healthy Active Living for Families \t The 5 Food Groups: Sample Choices\t Overcoming Obstacles to Physical Activity  \t What About Fat and Cholesterol? \t Your Family Health History & Genetics",

        "content": "​​​​​By: Juan Villafañe Jr., MD, FAAP & S. Kristen Sexson Tejtel, MD, PhD, FAAP ​When doctors listen to a child's heart, what they usually hear is a simple rhythm: \"lub-dub, lub-dub, lub-dub...\" Sometimes, they'll hear an extra sound in between the lub and the dub. That extra sound is called a heart murmur.  Although the name is unsettling, heart murmurs are very common in children. Usually, they are normal sounds made as the blood is pumped through the heart chambers, valves and arteries--like a whooshing or swishing noise. Rarely, they may need to be checked by a specialist to rule out any problems.  What kind of murmur is it?  There are two kinds of heart murmurs: innocent murmurs and pathologic murmurs. The doctor will listen to the murmur's loudness, timing and how long it lasts in the cardiac cycle, ​​which is the end of one heartbeat to the start of the next. Sometimes, it​​ is hard to tell the difference between the two kinds of murmurs just by listening. Some heart abnormalities may not produce a murmur at all. In those cases, an      echocardiogram  may be helpful.  If your doctor has a question about your child's heart murmur, they may refer you to a      pediatric cardiologist . Pediatric cardiologists have special training to look for heart problems that affect children. Innocent murmurs (functional murmurs) Innocent murmurs are harmless, but common. Over two-thirds of school-age children may have an innocent murmur. They may get louder if a child is excited, stressed, or ill. Many disappear as the child grows, although some do last into adulthood. Your doctor can detect these murmurs by simply listening to your child's heart with a stethoscope.  Children with innocent heart murmurs do not have a related heart problem. They do not need any medical treatment, surgery,      sports  restrictions, or follow-up with a pediatric cardiologist.  Even when pediatricians believe a child's murmur is innocent, however, they may still recommend a second opinion from a pediatric cardiologist to be certain. A referral to a pediatric cardiologist does not mean that the murmur is abnormal. Pediatricians are more likely to refer an infant with a heart murmur that occurs during the first six months of life.  Pathologic murmurs Rarely, a murmur can indicate a problem with the heart. This is called a pathologic murmur. Pathologic murmurs are much rarer and occur in less than 1% of the population. Sometimes, they may be related to congenital heart defect that a baby was born with.  Why does it sound like that? Pathologic murmurs are usually loud and may include an extra sound called a click, which is heard with a stethoscope. \t Causes of pathologic murmurs may include: abnormal connections between the right and left heart chambers.  abnormal connections between the major blood vessels coming from the heart.  blood that flows through a thickened or leaky heart valve.  Sometimes, the murmur gets louder when the patient changes position, such as standing up. Certain conditions are linked to pathologic murmurs, including:\t Mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation:  The mitral valve moves in an abnormal way and leaks.\t Hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy :  An abnormal thickening of the heart.  Pathologic murmurs often are not life-threatening While not normal, pathologic murmurs often are not life-threatening. They usually are heard when a child has a minor heart defect. But, if a child has a heart murmur and also develops symptoms such as shortness of breath, trouble eating or gaining weight, sweating while eating, or cyanosis (a blue tint to lips and skin), it could be a more serious condition that needs medical attention right away.  Your child's pediatric cardiologist may do some      testing , using an electrocardiogram and an echocardiogram, to confirm any heart abnormality.  Conditions that may be linked with pathologic heart murmurs  Certain syndromes or genetic      conditions  may be associated with a cardiac abnormality related to heart murmurs. These include:\t Down syndrome.  All children with            Down syndrome  should have a cardiac evaluation. Many of these patients may have a simple or more complex heart defect. \t Patent ductus arteriosus.  Premature infants  may have this condition. It occurs when a blood vessel (ductus arteriosus) does not close. This causes blood to circulate abnormally between the two major arteries near the heart. It is often found shortly after birth and can be confirmed by echocardiography.  Do murmurs need treatment? Innocent murmurs do not require treatment. If your child has a pathologic murmur, your pediatrician and pediatric cardiologist will talk with you about whether treatment is needed. Depending on the type of pathologic murmur your child has, they may need medication and follow-up care, or referral to a      pediatric heart surgeon .

        "content": "By: S. Kristen Sexson Tejtel, MD, PhD, FAAP & MPH, FAAP & Alan Riley, MD, FAAP Congenital heart disease is the term for defects that affect the heart that are present at birth (congenital). If your child has congenital heart disease, this means there's a problem with their heart's structure or the way it works.  There are many different types of congenital heart disease. Some are simple and don't need to be treated. Others are more complex and may need medication or surgery. If your child has congenital heart disease, read on for tips to help them stay healthy, active and fit. Why congenital heart disease puts kids at increased risk for obesity Children who have congenital heart disease are at a higher risk of having  overweight and obesity . There are several reasons for this, including:  \t Needing more calories in early life:  Babies with congenital heart disease tend to have a hard time gaining weight, since they burn more energy breathing faster and trying to eat. To help them grow, they're given high-calorie formula or supplements. But after surgery or over time as their child's symptoms get better, parents often keep using the same higher-calorie feedings. \t Having common risk factors:  Studies show that certain groups of kids are more at risk for obesity, including those who:  have a body mass index ( BMI ) between the 85th and 95th percentiles have a family history of obesity in one or both parents gain weight faster than they grow in height at a young age OR whose BMI increased quickly before age 7 years old have excessive weight gain in adolescence were very active and have become inactive are inactive in general, especially adolescents Many kids with congenital heart disease fall into one or more of these groups.\t Exercise restrictions:  In the past, doctors used to limit physical activity for kids and teens with congenital heart disease. Unfortunately, kids who begin an inactive lifestyle are more likely to stay that way. Now experts know that exercise and active play has many benefits and it's safe for most children with congenital heart disease. Even when it's doctor-approved, parents may worry about how exercise will affect their child. It can also be hard for kids who were told at first to limit their activity to get moving. Maintaining a healthy weight Your pediatrician will monitor your child's weight to make sure they're staying in a healthy range. If your child is gaining weight too fast, your doctor will talk to you about making some lifestyle changes. This includes changes in  diet , exercise, and reducing  inactivity .      Eating a healthy diet Dietary recommendations for kids and teens with congenital heart disease are the same as for any child. Keep these guidelines in mind when you plan meals.  Increase your child's dietary fiber to at least 14 g for every 1000 calories eaten. Foods that contain fiber include: Fresh fruits and  vegetables Whole-grain foods such as brown rice, whole-grain pasta, corn, peas, and breads Decrease your child's intake of dietary fat to less than 30% of their daily calorie intake. There are some simple ways to cut fat such as: Choose lower-fat or fat-free toppings like grated low-fat Parmesan cheese, salsa, herbed cottage cheese, nonfat/low-fat gravy, low-fat sour cream, low-fat salad dressing, or yogurt. Select lean meats such as skinless chicken and turkey, fish, lean beef cuts (round, sirloin, chuck, loin, and lean ground beef with no more than 15% fat content) and lean pork cuts (tenderloin, chops, ham). Buy \"choice\" or \"select\" grades of beef rather than \"prime.\" Trim off all visible fat. Remove skin from cooked poultry before eating. Include healthy oils such as canola or olive oil in your child's diet. Choose vegetable oils without trans fats made from canola, corn, sunflower, soybean, or olive oils.  Use nonstick vegetable sprays when cooking. Stick to fat-free cooking methods such as baking, broiling, grilling, poaching or steaming when cooking meat, poultry, or fish. Limit cholesterol to less than 300 mg daily. That means limiting full fat dairy, red and processed meat, fried foods, and baked goods.  Limit sodium to less than 2500 mg daily. Eliminate or limit  sugar-sweetened beverages  to less than 4 ounces per day. Encourage your child to  drink water  instead. Get familiar with actual serving sizes. For example, one piece of bread is one serving, not two (even though we use two for sandwiches).  Use the    Nutrition Facts label  on food packages to find foods with less saturated fat per serving. Pay attention to the serving size as you make choices. Remember that the percent daily values on food labels are based on portion sizes and calorie levels for adults. You'll need to adjust for your child. Staying active All kids and teens, including those with congenital heart disease, should  regularly participate  in physical activity or sports. Medical professionals recommend that children do  60 minutes  of physically active play or sports per day, every day.  Regular physical activity helps prevent weight gain and early-onset adult heart disease such as heart attacks and strokes. Many studies show that exercise can also help prevent diabetes,  high blood pressure  and high cholesterol. Most children with congenital heart disease live well into adult life. But when you have congenital heart disease, your heart may be more easily damaged by obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. This is why regular exercise is so important for everyone with congenital heart disease. When physical activity restrictions may be advised The majority of children with congenital heart disease don't need physical activity restrictions. However, some do. If your child is taking blood thinners or they have fragile implantable devices, abnormal heart rhythms, depressed heart function or decreased blood flow to the heart during exercise, their doctor may recommend restricting certain activities. Your pediatric cardiologist can advise you on the best physical activities for your child at your visits, even if activity restrictions are needed.  Be sure to check with your cardiologist before your child starts a new sport or exercise routine.  How to make physical activity a priority Daily physical activity is essential for everyone, including kids and teens with congenital heart disease. Here's how you can improve your child's activity levels:  Make sure your child gets at least an hour of moderate to vigorous activity every day. They should engage in vigorous activity at least 3 days a week. Manage your family's  media use  (computer, video game, TV, tablet, smart phone, etc.) to ensure a healthy balance of online and offline activity. Keep TVs, electronics and screens out of your child's bedroom. Support the recommendations for daily physical education at your child's school. Tips to create an active lifestyle In today's busy world, it's harder and harder for children to play and run outside on a daily basis. That makes organized sports and exercise activities good options. Let your child participate in choosing an activity or sport to try. If they enjoy it, they'll want to keep doing it.  Planning activities with friends can also encourage your child to stay active. Team sports are a great way to get exercise with friends. Getting family members involved can go a long way too. Take family walks, hikes or bike rides. Do a workout video or stretches together. Put on a fun dance video game. Try family bowling, roller skating, or laser tag. Wearable step counters or heart rate monitors are another way to make exercise fun. Most devices allow you to set goals. This encourages more physical activity. Your child may be inspired to see how many steps they've walked in a day or how long their heart was elevated during a workout.  Remember that sports and exercise should be fun. Kids will be more likely to get exercise or participate in sports that they enjoy. The goal is to build a life-long habit of regular exercise. Forcing exercise that your child doesn't like or doesn't find rewarding won't last. Be creative and find ways to get out there and have fun with exercise.

        "content": "​By: Christopher Snyder, MD, FAAP & Brad McQuilkin, MD, FAAP Many parents think of cholesterol as a health concern that only affects adults. But did you know that around 1 in 250 children have high cholesterol levels that aren't related to diet, exercise or lifestyle? These kids have a genetic condition called      familial hypercholesterolemia , or FH. Even if they eat healthfully and live an      active  life, they are at risk for early heart disease. Here's what parents and families need to know about FH—especially the most serious form of this condition that can be life-threatening for children and teens.\t   Cholesterol and your child's health\t Cholesterol  is a waxy, fat-like substance found normally in every cell of our bodies. The liver produces cholesterol to keep our cells working smoothly. Cholesterol also supports the production of hormones and vitamins essential for continued good health. When we eat animal products like dairy, eggs or meat, we take in extra cholesterol. In most cases, our bodies can remove what we don't need. But for people with FH, a mutation in the      genetic code  gets in the way of this process. As a result, LDL cholesterol (often called \"bad\" cholesterol) builds up in the arteries from birth. This buildup, called      plaque , can lead to heart attacks and      stroke  early in life. A health threat many families don't know about If this is the first time you've heard of FH, you're not alone. Millions of people worldwide live with FH, but only 30% know they have it. There are two forms of FH, and they're different based on the way the FH gene mutation is passed from parent to child. What are the two types of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)? The most common form of FH is known as         heterozygous FH (HeFH) . A child with HeFH has inherited an abnormal copy of the FG gene from         one  birth parent. An estimated 1 in 250 people have HeFH. When a child inherits an abnormal copy of the FH gene from both parents, they have a condition known as        \t homozygous FH  (HoFH) . HoFH is a         rare  condition that needs immediate treatment. Finding FH early can reduce heart health risks As frightening as all this may sound, there's good news. Identifying and treating FH early can reduce risks for coronary artery disease by as much as 80%. The process begins with knowing your      family health history .\t Be sure to tell your pediatrician if a parent, grandparent, aunt or uncle of your child suffered early heart attacks  (before age 55 for males and age 65 for females). High cholesterol or coronary artery disease in close relatives should be noted, too. ( This article  includes a list of heart history factors to mention.) At what age should my child be screened for high cholesterol? Based on this background, your child's doctor can decide how early to test your child's cholesterol levels. When no family risks are present, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends cholesterol screening starting between age 9 and 11. But when there's a chance of inherited heart trouble, screening starts as early as      age 2 . If blood tests show your child's LDL cholesterol level is above      160 mg/DL , then FH may be present. Children diagnosed with HoFH often have LDL cholesterol levels that are above 400 mg/DL, or more than 4 times the level considered safe between ages 2 and 19. Extremely high LDL levels of 1,000 mg/dL have been seen in some children with HoFH. Are there possible signs of high cholesterol in children that parents may notice? Sometimes a child with HoFH will have orange or yellowish cholesterol deposits ( xanthomas ) on or near their elbows, legs, ankles, buttocks or fingers. Or, they may be near the corners of the eyes ( xanthelasmas ). If you see these signs, let your pediatrician know right away. Understanding HoFH  HoFH, the more severe form of inherited high cholesterol, is very rare. It affects only about 1 in 300,000 people worldwide, but health care professionals are working to widen awareness of the condition. Dangerous buildup of cholesterol caused by HoFH can cause heart attacks in the teen years or younger. In fact, people with untreated HoFH frequently succumb to heart disease before age 30. If tests suggest your child has this condition,      remember you didn't do anything to cause it.  Having the FH gene does not reflect on your diet, your fitness level, or any other risk factor you can control. Keeping this in mind can help you move forward with a treatment plan for your child (and screening for the rest of your family). Creating a HoFH treatment plan for your child Thanks to continuous research and development, there are many ways to reduce LDL cholesterol levels in kids and adults. The FDA has approved several medications for children, and more are in development. So, your child's medical team will have multiple tools to work with in addressing your child's HoFH. If your child is diagnosed with HoFH, your pediatrician will recommend a medical specialist focused on heart health and lipids. Your child's care plan might include:\t   Statins , or drugs that reduce the amount of cholesterol made by the liver while helping the liver remove cholesterol already in the bloodstream. \t Non-statin medications  that work with the liver, small intestine and specific chemical pathways to lower LDL cholesterol. \t Lipoprotein apheresis , a procedure that removes LDL cholesterol from the blood each week.  Along with medication, eating a heart-healthy diet, staying active and avoiding      tobacco  will be important throughout your child's life. A      dietitian  may join your child's care team to offer guidance and suggestions for nutritious meals and snacks your family will enjoy.  After an FH diagnosis: family-wide support & screening\t Whatever steps your child's medical team recommends, you will need support too.  Keep in mind that starting a new health routine can create stress that affects everyone's mental well-being.  Don't hesitate to ask the health care team for help if you have difficulty getting your child to take their meds or settle into the treatment plan. Focusing on family basics such as healthy      sleep , regular      meals  and free time with      friends  will help all of you maintain a good balance. Make it a priority to have your child's siblings screened, and share news of your child's diagnosis with other family members. When people with FH address high LDL cholesterol early in life, their risks can drop to the same levels as the general population — a healthy goal worth pursuing.

        "content": "​​​​​​​​Kawasaki disease is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in infants and young children in the United States. More than 4,200 U.S. children are diagnosed with Kawasaki disease each year. The condition causes inflammation in the blood vessels, and the symptoms can be severe. In addition to several days of fever, children with Kawasaki disease may develop symptoms such as rash, swollen neck glands,  swollen hands and feet, and red eyes, lips and tongue.  Early on, Kawasaki disease can affect the function of the heart muscle or the heart valves. If it is recognized and treated early, children can begin to feel better in a few days with a low likelihood of long-term heart issues. Fast Facts:  80% to 90% of Kawasaki disease cases occur in children under age 5 and older than 6 months. It is less common for older children and adolescents to get the disease, but some do.   Kawasaki disease is not contagious. It does not spread among family members or children in child care centers.  Kawasaki disease occurs more frequently in children of Asian or Pacific Island ancestry. However, it can affect people in all racial and ethnic groups. The cause of Kawasaki disease is not known, but it is thought to be a reaction by the body's immune system.  Signs & Symptoms:   Kawasaki Disease begins with a  fever  above 102 degrees F that lasts for at least five days. Other signs and symptoms may include: Rash anywhere on the body but more severe in the diaper area.  Red, bloodshot eyes without pus, drainage, or crusting. Swelling and tenderness of a gland (lymph node) on one side of the neck. Swollen hands and feet with redness on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Very red, swollen, and cracked lips; strawberry-like tongue with rough, red spots. Significant irritability and fussiness.  Peeling fingers and toes (typically 2 to 3 weeks after the beginning of fever). Note: The following key signs and symptoms may not be present at the same time . In some very young infants, only a few of these actually develop. Other non-specific symptoms may also be present, such as vomiting, diarrhea, stomachache, cough, runny nose, headache, or pain or swelling of the joints.  When to call the doctor: If your child has a fever for 4 to 5 days with any of the key signs and symptoms above, ask your doctor whether he or she could have Kawasaki disease. It can be challenging to diagnose, so your child may have to be examined several times.  See  When to Call the Pediatrician: Fever  for more information specific to fevers.    Diagnosis:   There is no specific, single test to diagnose Kawasaki disease. If Kawasaki disease is suspected, however, your doctor may order tests to monitor heart function (an echocardiogram) and may take blood and urine samples. In addition, your doctor may refer you to a pediatric specialist in  infectious disease ,  rheumatology  or  cardiology  for more guidance in diagnosis and treatment.  Complications if left untreated:  If Kawasaki disease is left untreated, it can lead to serious complications such as inflammation of the blood vessels. This can be particularly dangerous because it can affect the coronary arteries--the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart muscle--causing coronary artery aneurysms to develop. An  aneurysm  is a ballooning out of a damaged and weakened blood vessel wall.  Fortunately, treatment within the first 10 days of illness significantly decreases the risk of aneurysms. That's why it is very important to diagnose Kawasaki disease by the 10 th  day of the illness. Treatment should begin as soon as possible.  Treatment for Kawasaki Disease: Children diagnosed with Kawasaki disease are admitted to the hospital. The medication used to treat Kawasaki disease in the hospital is called intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG). IVIG is given through a vein over 8 to 12 hours. Children stay in the hospital for at least 24 hours after completing the IVIG dose to make sure the fever does not return and other symptoms are improving.  Children may also be given aspirin to lower the risk of heart problems. (Aspirin should only be given to young children under doctors' supervision, as it can cause a serious liver condition called Reye Syndrome.)​ Additional treatments may be needed if a child does not respond well to the single dose of IVIG, the fever returns, or there are abnormal findings on the first echocardiogram. Another dose of IVIG or other medications that fight inflammation such as steroids, infliximab, or etanercept may be recommended. Pediatric specialists in rheumatology, infectious disease, or cardiology may be consulted in this situation. What to expect after hospital discharge:  Children treated for Kawasaki Disease are sent home from the hospital on a low dose of aspirin to take by mouth every day for 6 to 8 weeks. As they recover, it is not uncommon for these children to be extra tired or seem \"off\" for several weeks. Rest is very important. Peeling of skin the hands and feet is expected and is not cause for alarm. Call your doctor right away if your child develops a fever or any of the other symptoms of Kawasaki Disease return.  Further evaluation will be needed to determine if your child needs to be go back to the hospital. Follow-up Care:  It is very important to closely monitor children who have had Kawasaki Disease to make sure they are improving and to check for the development of coronary aneurysms. Aneurysms most often form after the first couple of weeks of illness, so children should be scheduled for an echocardiogram and a check-up at 2 weeks and again at 6 to 8 weeks after their fever first started. More frequent follow up and echocardiograms will be necessary if there are abnormal findings on any of the echocardiograms. Note:  Live viral vaccines should be postponed at least 11 months after IVIG, because IVIG can cause the vaccines to be ineffective. These include the  MMR (measles, mumps, rubella)  and  Varicella (chicken pox) vaccines . Children over 6 months of age should receive the inactivated  influenza (flu) vaccine  injection.  Long-term follow-up: Children treated for Kawasaki disease who  do not  develop aneurysms have an excellent long-term outcome. However, it is important for them to follow a heart healthy diet and lifestyle. Cholesterol levels should be checked every 5 years.  Children who  do  have coronary aneurysms should be under the care of a pediatric cardiologist as they grow and will require special long-term care and follow-up.

        "content": "​​​​​​By: Leah W. Burke, MD, FAAP  About 1 out of every 5,000 people are born with Marfan syndrome. The condition makes connective tissues that support parts of the body stretch more than usual.  Because of this, kids with Marfan syndrome may grow differently. For example, their bones may grow longer than usual. Marfan syndrome can also affect tissues in the heart and blood vessels, eyes, skin, lungs and other body systems. Working with your child's doctors to monitor their health can help prevent and treat any complications. Read on to learn more. Are some children at higher risk of getting Marfan syndrome? Marfan syndrome is inherited in three-quarters of cases, so family typically plays a role. However, some cases are new in a family. It affects boys, girls and people of all races equally.  What are some possible signs & symptoms of Marfan syndrome in children? Some signs of Marfan syndrome may be present at birth but typically are more noticeable as a child gets older. Children with Marfan syndrome tend to be: taller​  and thinner than average, with long arms, fingers and legs. Their arm span may be longer than their height. more likely to have a curve in the spine (scoliosis), chest bones that stick out or cave in,  flat feet​  or crowded teeth.  more prone to            hernias  and stretch marks on their skin. In addition, cuts and scrapes may heal with unusual scars. They may have trouble  sleeping​  and may be more tired than average, especially as they get older.  Not all children with Marfan will share these common characteristics, though. What kinds of medical treatments might children with Marfan syndrome need? Every child with Marfan syndrome is different, so treatments they may need will vary. It will depend on the parts of the body that are affected. Treatments may include medications, surgery or other options to manage the condition and any complications. Children with Marfan syndrome may be on medication that lowers blood pressure to reduce the strain on their blood vessels, for example.  Other considerations to keep children with Marfan syndrome safe & healthy Some children with Marfan syndrome may need to avoid vigorous      physical activity  such as competitive sports, but normal play is encouraged. They can have loose joints and might get hand pain after prolonged grasping of writing tools such as crayons. If the child has  vision  problems, they might need special glasses or other accommodations. Ask your child's doctor if they need any restrictions on activities such as blowing up balloons.  What symptoms should be considered a medical emergency for a child with Marfan syndrome? Call emergency medical services (911) immediately for any of the following symptoms: Aortic aneurysm or rupture can be a life-threatening emergency. It might start with            chest pain , loss of consciousness, numbness or color change (pale or blue). Sudden chest pain could also mean a pneumothorax (an air leak around the lung). Sudden changes of vision or unexplained flashes of light, which might signal an optical lens dislocation.  Who might be on the treatment team for a child with Marfan syndrome? Pediatrician/primary care provider in the medical home Physical therapists Ophthalmologists (eye doctors) Cardiologists​  (heart doctors) Geneticists (gene doctors) Orthopedic surgeons (muscle and bone surgeons) What is the long-term outlook for children with Marfan syndrome? Increased medical monitoring, along with research and advances in treatments and surgeries, allow people with Marfan syndrome to live long, productive lives.

Who to Put First?  It may be difficult some days to figure out who to put first – your children or yourself. When it is hard to find the energy to even get out of bed, it is important to take care of your own physical and emotional needs first. As a parent, this may not sound \"right,\" but the  best gift you can give your child  is to also care for yourself. A CHD can be unpredictable, as can your child's needs. Plan ahead.  Ask for help.  When a CHD overrules parenthood, call friends, family members or a sitter to help. Parenting changes with older children, but you still need to be okay with reaching out to others.  Find time to relax.  Whether visiting with friends, seeing a movie, meditating, or just reading, it is essential to make relaxation a priority.  Lower your expectations.  Your parenting style may be different from your sister's or your friend's, but that does not mean you are not a good parent. Lowering your expectations will help make meeting the challenges of parenting with a CHD seem easier.  Planning for the Future Every person with a CHD should have a living will. It not only notifies your family members about your wishes, but it also guides them in decision making if you are unable to speak for yourself.  Once you have a living will, be sure to:  Store it in a safe place in your home and tell your family members where it is located . This is not a document to keep in the bank safety deposit box.

The specific members of this team may differ depending on where you live and what kind of heart condition you have.  Congenital Cardiologist:  In particular, one who specializes in adults with CHDs. Maternal-Fetal-Medicine Specialist:  Also called a \"high-risk obstetrician\" and has experience caring for women with a CHD.   Genetic Counselor:  Reviews your  medical history  and may perform testing to discuss the baby's risk for having a CHD. In general, a baby whose mother or father has a CHD has a small increased chance (about 5%) of being  born with a CHD , too. Anesthesiologist:  Can talk to you about anesthesia options for labor and delivery. Most women with a CHD can have an  epidural  during labor and delivery. Vaginal delivery is usually preferred over a caesarean section for most women with a CHD. There may be some special monitoring and accommodations made during your labor and delivery, but all medical care is geared toward the safety of you and your baby. Social Worker:  Can help counsel you and your partner on how to handle the stress of managing both your cardiac and pregnancy health.  During Your Pregnancy:  It is very important to maintain regular care with your obstetrician and congenital cardiologist throughout your pregnancy. Although most women will do well and have healthy pregnancies, women with a CHD do have a higher risk for pregnancy complications, including  arrhythmias  or irregular heartbeats and  premature birth .  Your congenital cardiologist ​will determine how often you will require cardiac care during pregnancy. Most women with a CHD see their congenital cardiologist once each trimester, but sometimes more frequent appointments are needed. Your doctor will also determine whether you need cardiac testing during your pregnancy. Most women with a CHD receive an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) early in pregnancy and in the last trimester. As with any pregnant woman, there are ways you can help reduce health risks to your baby before and during pregnancy:  Take a daily prenatal vitamin that includes folate. Avoid  smoking ,  alcohol  and other drugs (other than medications prescribed by your doctor). Eat a  healthy diet .   Exercise . Get enough rest. Labor & Delivery: At some point, you will discuss the type of delivery— vaginal  or  cesarean section —with your obstetrician. Typically, a vaginal delivery is preferred over a cesarean section for most women with a CHD. There may be some special monitoring and accommodations made during your labor and delivery, but all medical care is geared toward the safety of you and your baby. Regardless of the type of delivery, an anesthesiologist is usually involved to assist with pain control. Most women with a CHD can have an epidural during labor and delivery, but some types of medicine for pain control can affect the heart rate and blood pressure—why meeting with an anesthesiologist before delivery is important! Your Baby's Health: Your baby is at increased risk of being born with a CHD if you or your baby's father have a CHD. Preconception counseling can also assess your baby's CHD risk.  Once you're expecting, your doctor will do a special ultrasound of your baby's heart, called a fetal echocardiogram, to see if your baby has any major structural issues to the heart.   Additional Information from HealthyChildren.org: Tests & Screenings During Pregnancy Let Baby Set the Delivery Date: Wait until 39 Weeks if You Can Parenting with CHD: Why Prioritizing Your Own Health is Important ​ Additional information regarding congenital heart defects and lifelong cardiac care is available at the Congenital Heart Public Health Consortium (CHPHC) website,  www.chphc.org .

        "content": "​By: Kristen Sexson-Tejtel, MD FAAP & Carolyn Altman, MD FAAP Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is a condition caused by a problem with the way the nerves regulate blood flow. As a result, enough blood doesn't go to the right place at the right time. For example, when a child or teen with POTS stands up (a change in posture), the blood vessels in the legs and feet are overly relaxed and allow pooling of blood in the veins there. This, in turn, decreases the blood flow back to the heart and brain. This can cause dizziness and blurred vision.  To make up for the lack of blood flow, the heart beats much faster (tachycardia). With POTS, there is usually an increase in heart rate by 30-40 points from lying to standing or a standing heart rate of greater than 120 bpm. POTS often starts around the time of puberty but can develop at any age. About 75-85% of cases are in females. POTS may improve or even disappear in 80% in most people by the time they are in their early 20s. Symptoms sometimes begin after a viral illness, major surgery, or trauma. They often are worse in the morning, making it difficult to get ready for school.  What causes POTS? POTS is thought to be a disorder of the autonomic nervous system, the part of the nervous system that controls heart rate, blood pressure, movement of food through the gut, sweating, and many other functions. Other factors that can contribute to POTS include dehydration, poor fitness, anxiety, and/or hypervigilance (being much more sensitive to feeling changes in the body). Symptoms of POTS POTS causes a variety of symptoms with the heart and blood vessels, including:  Palpitations (the sensation of rapid changes in heart rate or        racing heartbeat ) Chest discomfort Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting ( syncope ) Exercise intolerance--feeling too fatigued for reasonable physical activity Extreme tiredness  Because the autonomic nervous system has such a wide impact throughout the body, other symptoms of POTS may include:  Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms like nausea, bloating, cramping, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation Muscle and/or joint pain Trouble sleeping (insomnia) \t Headaches , especially migraines Blurred vision Fuzzy thinking, poor concentration or \"brain fog\" Anxiety and/or depression Cold extremities with reddish/purplish coloration of the feet Heavy, painful and prolonged menstrual periods  Diagnosing POTS A thorough history and physical exam are the keys to help your child's doctor make the diagnosis of POTS. They may also recommend some tests, such as: Orthostatic vital sign measurements including the Active Stand Test are very helpful: the child's heart rate and blood pressure are measured first while lying down, then sitting, and then while standing for 2, 5 and 10 minutes. If the patient is < 19 years old, the test is abnormal if the heart rate rises more than 40 beats above the resting rate by 10 minutes of standing (more than 30 beats is the cut off if older than 19 years). A drop in blood pressure with standing occurs less frequently. The Active Stand Test may bring on the symptoms of POTS. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is used to rule out other heart problems that can cause racing heart beats. Other tests that are sometimes needed include:  Blood tests: thyroid function tests, complete blood counts 24 Hour Holter monitor: this device records all the heart beats for 24 hours so the heart rate and rhythm can be examined  Echocardiogram: an ultrasound of the heart to look at the heart's structure and function A team of specialists may be involved in managing this multi-system disorder. It may include cardiologists, neurologists, gastroenterologists, therapists, psychiatrists, rheumatologists, or endocrinologists.  Treatment for POTS There is no perfect treatment for POTS. Treatment is individualized to each child's specific symptoms, and recommendations may include:  Increasing water intake to at least 60-80 ounces per day (depending upon the child's size) and an increase in the amount of salt in the diet. Together, these help to retain fluid and fill up the overly relaxed blood vessels.  Getting lots of sleep- up to 10 hours a night. Sleeping with the head of the bed mildly raised. Over time, this decreases morning symptoms of dizziness as the nervous system is retrained. Exercising. Gentle workouts at first and gradually increasing to moderate exercise daily. To start, exercises need to be those where the child is not upright, like swimming, recumbent biking, or rowing. Improving leg and core strength improves blood return from the legs. Exercise also improves fitness and energy, and helps to retrain the nervous system over time.  Eating a healthy diet and avoiding skipping meals. Frequent, small meals can be helpful. Wearing compression stockings. Avoiding caffeine. Are there medications for POTS? Medications are typically considered only for those patients who still have significant symptoms even after trying the above changes in hydration, sleep and exercise. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist or neurologist with expertise in POTS is recommended if medications are needed. A variety of different medications are possible, and must be tailored to the individual child's symptoms. Medications are used to together with, not as a substitute for, the treatments above.  Other types of care for POTS Because POTS may last for years and can include flare-ups of symptoms, it is easy to become frustrated, anxious, stressed and even depressed. Many families benefit from counseling to help deal with this chronic disorder. Children may require special care plans at school.

        "content": "​​Even though pregnancy and childbirth stress the heart, most women with a congenital heart defect (CHD) are able to have healthy pregnancies if they choose to do so. Women with a CHD interested in getting pregnant should see a health care professional who specializes in CHDs before becoming pregnant to determine any risks for complications during pregnancy.  Preconception counseling—as it is called—can identify any heart problems that may need treatment before conception to assess a baby's risk of being born with a CHD.   Consult with a Specialist:  If you have a CHD and are considering becoming pregnant, you should schedule an appointment with a congenital cardiologist. You will need to tell the congenital cardiologist if you have any cardiac symptoms, such as: Shortness of breath Fatigue  Chest pain  Dizziness  Heart palpitations (i.e. a feeling like your heart is fluttering or beating too fast or too hard)   Bring a list of all of your medications to a preconception counseling appointment for review. Some medications should not be taken during pregnancy.   Cardiac Testing Prior to Conception:  Your doctor will perform special medical tests​​ to see if your heart can handle the increased demands of pregnancy. At a minimum, you will receive an echocardiogram—a type of ultrasound that allows doctors to see a video of the heart. Depending on your symptoms and echocardiogram results, your doctor may perform other tests such as: Holter monitoring:  Provides a constant reading of your heartbeat so your doctor can see if you have an unusual heart rhythm. E xercise test:  Shows your doctor how your heart handles stress when it needs to work harder. Cardiac MRI:  Another type of imaging test that can very accurately show heart size and how well the heart is working.  About catheterization:  Occasionally, pre-conception ​​test results show that a woman needs a surgery or a  catheterization —a nonsurgical way to treat the heart. Catheterization is done by inserting a thin tube into a blood vessel in the neck, arm or leg and threading it to the heart.  Your doctor may recommend performing surgery or catheterization before pregnancy to treat damage to a heart valve, narrowing of a vessel, or an aneurysm. Determining Risks for Pregnancy Complications: Your congenital cardiologist will give you a \"risk assessment\" on your likelihood to have cardiac complications during pregnancy. In some cases, your doctor may say your risk of having a dangerous pregnancy is very high. In this situation, discussions with your doctors can help you and your partner better understand these risks as well as consider  other options .   Preconception Counseling with Other Specialists: Ask your congenital cardiologist for help finding other medical specialists who can help you make decisions about pregnancy and delivery.  Maternal-Fetal-Medicine Specialist:  Also called a \"high-risk obstetrician\" and has experience caring for women with a CHD.   Genetic Counselor:  Reviews your  medical history  and may perform testing to determine the baby's risk for having a CHD. In general, a baby whose mother or father has a CHD has a small increased chance (about 5% on average) of being  born with a CHD , too.

        "content": "By: Caitlin Haxel, MD, FAAP & Julie Glickstein, MD, FAAP Pulmonary hypertension  is high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. It is a rare, progressive disease affecting people of all ages.  How pulmonary hypertension affects infants and children:  Children are either born with narrowing in the lung arteries or the arteries become thicker and narrower over time. The narrowing in the arteries causes increased pressure. The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs to receive oxygen. In  pulmonary arterial hypertension , a type of pulmonary hypertension, the right ventricle needs to pump against the increased pressure in the lung arteries. This can lead to heart problems over time, especially with the right ventricle. The walls of the right ventricle can become much thicker than normal, and the function of the right ventricle can decrease over time. Pulmonary hypertension in newborns: Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)  is the term used when babies are born with the disease. Normal transitions in circulation that should occur after birth do not, and this can lead to symptoms such as fast breathing, difficulty breathing, and/or low oxygen saturation.  Pulmonary hypertension in children:  Pulmonary hypertension can develop in children due to an unknown cause ( idiopathic PH ) or due to another medical problem including congenital heart or lung disease.  Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension: Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension depend on the exact cause, and a complete work-up is needed to figure out what that underlying cause is.  In children, there can be a range of symptoms including: Fatigue with activity Shortness of breath with activity Chest pain Fainting, particularly with activity Swelling of the legs or ankles Dizziness  What type of doctor treats children with pulmonary hypertension? If your pediatrician is concerned about your child's symptoms, you may be referred to a pediatric pulmonary hypertension specialist for an evaluation―usually a pediatric cardiologist or pulmonologist with extensive training in pulmonary hypertension who treats many children with the condition.  Diagnosing pulmonary hypertension:  To confirm the diagnosis, your child's doctors will review the results of a physical exam and various tests taken at the appointment.  Examples of tests include: Chest x-ray Electrocardiogram (tracing of the electrical activity in the heart) Echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) Six-minute walk test or cardiopulmonary exercise testing (to understand how the body responds to exercise) Ventilation-perfusion lung scintigraphy (looks at the circulation of blood and air in the lungs) More advanced imaging: Chest/cardiac computed tomography (CT) (uses radiation to look at the lungs and blood vessels) Chest/cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (uses magnetic fields to look at the lungs and blood vessels) Cardiac catheterization (procedure to measure the pressure in the blood vessels in the lungs) Lung biopsy (invasive procedure to get a small amount of lung tissue for testing)  Treatments for pulmonary hypertension: Whenever possible, it is important to identify and treat the underlying problem. If your child has a heart valve problem that is causing the pulmonary hypertension, for example, then treatment would first involve repair to the valve.  There are many medications used to decrease the pressure in the lung blood vessels that improve the quality of life for infants and children with pulmonary hypertension. Warfarin (Coumadin), digoxin, and vasodilators, such as nifedipine, intravenous prostacyclin, or both are examples. These medications can be taken by mouth, inhaled into the lungs, or given through an IV into the blood vessels. Everyone responds differently to treatment, so it is important to talk with your child's doctors to determine what is right for your child.  Outlook for children with this disease:  There is no cure for pulmonary hypertension, and some children eventually require lung or heart-lung transplants. However, new treatments are available to help prevent the disease from progressing and new research is being done all the time to hopefully result in more options.   Additional Information:  Parents of Children with PH  (Pulmonary Hypertension Association) Frequently Asked Questions for Parents of Children with PH  (Pulmonary Hypertension Association) Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension Network Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension  ( Pediatrics in Review,  March 2016) About Dr. Haxel: Caitlin Haxel, MD, FAAP, is a pediatric cardiology fellow focusing on advanced imaging and fetal cardiology at the Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora, Colorado.

        "content": "​​​A congenital heart defect (CHD) is the most common type of birth defect. Due to advances in medical and surgical therapies, more than 90% of infants born with a CHD will live to see their 18 th  birthday.  As dreams of a full and rich adult life—including a career and family—frequently become reality, adolescents and adults should receive specialized cardiology care throughout their lifetime. The impact of a CHD and its interaction with typical conditions of adulthood such as pregnancy, diabetes, and hypertension must be considered as women living with CHD age.  ​​​\"Young women living with a CHD can expect better outcomes if they partner with their health care team when making health decisions, especially when it comes to reproductive health,\" said Elyse Foster, M.D., a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and a member of the  Congenital Heart Public Health Consortium (CHP​HC) .  Anyone who has a heart murmur or had heart surgery as a child should be evaluated by a congenital cardiologist as an adult.  Women living with a CHD, specifically, can make informed choices and decrease their chances of a high-risk birth when they work with their health care team. While the overall risk of complications during pregnancy is relatively low, women with a CHD are still eight times as likely to experience cardiovascular complications during pregnancy.  Reproductive health considerations should start even before a young woman is ready to start a family. These topics should include contraception, the decision to carry a pregnancy, and the challenges of parenting with a CHD. See the articles below for more information on each subject.

        "content": "​We usually think of high blood pressure—also known as hypertension—as a problem that affects adults. But, in fact, the condition can be present at any age.  An estimated 3.5% of all children and teens in the United States have high blood pressure, however, the condition often goes undetected and untreated. Early Detection is Key If high blood pressure isn't identified at a young age, it could go undiagnosed for years—eventually leading to organ damage and other health problems, like coronary artery disease, in adulthood. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) report,   Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Screening and Management of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents , gives pediatricians a simpler screening table to follow that identifies blood pressures needing further evaluation. How blood pressure is measured? The term  blood pressure  actually refers to two separate measurements: Systolic blood pressure  is the highest pressure reached in the arteries as the heart pumps blood out for circulation through the body. Diastolic blood pressure  is the much lower pressure that occurs in the arteries when the heart relaxes to take blood in between beats. If either or both measurements are above the range found in healthy people of the same age and sex, it's called hypertension. Screening Kids for High Blood Pressure   It's a difficult diagnosis in kids since blood pressure can be affected by many factors, such as height, age and sex.  The AAP and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute both recommend that children have yearly screenings for high blood pressure, starting at age 3, at their  annual well-child visits .  If your child's blood pressure is high , he or she will typically be asked to come back a week later to see if the high readings persist.  If your child has elevated readings in three consecutive visits , he or she should have an evaluation for the cause of hypertension and risk of organ injury. Infants who were preterm, or of low birth weight, who had a difficult or long hospital stay may need blood pressure screenings sooner than age 3. Children who have  congenital heart disease , who are receiving medications that might increase blood pressure, or who have other medical conditions may also be at a greater risk of high blood pressure. Tip for parents:  Remember to ask your pediatrician if he or she measured your child's blood pressure, and if so, if it was a concerning reading. What are the Causes? High blood pressure in children is almost always asymptomatic—that is, without any symptoms or noticeable discomfort. In many cases, high blood pressure seems to develop with age. As a result, a child may show no signs of high blood pressure as an infant, but may develop the condition as he or she grows.  By age 7, more than 50% of hypertension is due to obesity; this rises to 85-95% by the teenage years. Thus, good eating habits (without overeating and emphasizing foods low in sodium, low in added sugar and high in fruits and vegetables) and plenty of physical activity are important throughout the early years of childhood (and for the rest of life). When high blood pressure becomes severe in children, it may be a symptom of another serious problem, such as  kidney disease  or abnormalities of the heart or of the nervous or endocrine (gland) system. Diagnosing High Blood Pressure in Children​ If your child's blood pressure is high, your pediatrician may recommend tests to see if there is an underlying medical problem causing it. These tests include studies of the urine and blood. Sometimes, ultrasounds are used to examine the heart or the kidneys. If no medical problem can be found, your child will be diagnosed with  essential hypertension —the word  essential  refers only to the fact that no cause could be found. About essential hypertension:  In most children and adolescents, no specific cause is found for hypertension. Doctors take into account the child's medical history (other diagnoses like kidney disease), family history (heritability of hypertension is about 50%),  risk factors such as low weight at birth, and whether the child is currently overweight. Management & Treatment  The first-line treatment for high blood pressure in children remains lifestyle changes. If obesity is a possible cause, the first step will be to have your child lose weight. This will need to be very closely monitored by your pediatrician. Not only will weight loss lower blood pressure, it can provide many other health benefits as well. Limit the  salt  in your child's diet. Giving up the use of table salt and restricting salty foods can lower blood pressure in some patients. Common sources of salty foods include bread, deli meats, pizza, and foods prepared outside the home.    Use caution when shopping for packaged foods. Most canned and processed foods contain a great deal of salt, so  check labels carefully  to make sure the items have little or no salt added. Help your child get more aerobic exercise. Aerobic physical activity can lower blood pressure, because of its effect on blood vessels and the heart—even when patients do not lose weight. The AAP recommends  60 minutes  of physical activity each day.  About blood pressure-lowering medications:  If lifestyle changes do not work, or if the blood pressure is very high, a more aggressive approach is needed. The AAP guidelines recommend pediatricians start blood pressure-lowering medications if lifestyle changes fail to reduce your child's blood pressure, or your child has another condition like diabetes or kidney disease.  There are a variety of anti-hypertensive medications that have been tested and proven to be safe in the short- and long-term. The number of children who will end up with prescriptions for anti-hypertensive medications is small, about 1% or less.  Long-term care:  Once your pediatrician knows your child has high blood pressure, he or she will want to check it frequently to make sure the hypertension is not becoming more severe. Depending on how high the blood pressure is, your pediatrician may refer your child to a specialist—usually a  pediatric nephrologist  (kidney specialist) or  pediatric cardiologist  (heart specialist).

But families face unique challenges when their baby is born with a congenital heart defect. A congenital    heart defect  is a problem with the heart that is present at birth. For example, a baby may be born with a hole in their heart or a leaky valve. Sometimes, the heart defect is more severe, and their heart has missing vessels or chambers or is not fully formed. Fortunately, people with heart defects are living longer, healthier lives. But even if a heart defect has been surgically repaired and is not causing symptoms, your child needs to continue to see a pediatric cardiologist who can catch any problems early and keep your child healthy. Read on to learn more about lifelong care for people with congenital heart defects. Consider how congenital heart defects affect your child's development.  Children with heart defects may    meet developmental milestones  at a different pace. Young children may benefit from early intervention support as they learn new skills and work through challenges. Parents, you know your child best. Do not hesitate to ask your pediatrician if you have any concerns about the way your child plays, learns, speaks, acts or moves. Learn more    here . In school, they may reach milestones on a different timeline than peers without heart defects. And sometimes, your child may have to miss school for appointments, tests or other procedures. No matter your child's age, your pediatrician can explain other types of support, such as    milestones ,    learning  and    other concerns .\t Need help understanding your medical bills and benefits?  \t Watch this video about Medical Billing Help: Understanding Your Charges\t  \t Make sure your child has a role in their congenital heart defect care. From an early age, your child should be involved in their own care with their pediatric cardiologist and other health care providers. This can help them feel more confident in their own health decisions as they move into their adult life. Your child's health care team can help identify risks and support their nutritional, exercise and cardiac their changing needs as they develop and grow. Prepare to move from pediatric to adult cardiac care. Children with congenital heart defects need to continue their congenital cardiac care into adulthood. The pediatric cardiologist that has cared for your child may only see them up to a certain age. When they are old enough, they need to start seeing an adult congenital cardiologist who can make sure they stay healthy as an adult.  Families should begin planning for this    transition  well before they become an adult. Help them prepare to take on more responsibility for their health. This will help them learn how to schedule doctor visits, understand health insurance and keep track of their medications in    college  and beyond.

We know you are looking for answers, for information, for anything that will help you understand this and get you through what is ahead for you. How do we know this? Because we have been there, too.   Heart Mom to Heart Mom: You are not alone on this journey!  Don't compare your child to \"heart-healthy\" children . If you want to see if your child is meeting milestones, ask your child's doctors what is \"normal\" for a child with his or her heart defect―not what is normal for a heart-healthy child your child's age.  You choose who to listen to, take advice from, and rely on during your journey . Not everyone will understand what you are going though. The ones who do, who want to understand how to help you, will be integral parts of your support system. Don't be afraid to ask questions.  If you feel like something is wrong, don't be afraid to ask your child's healthcare team. Everyone has unique strengths and knowledge. For example, if you are having trouble with insurance coverage, turn to your pediatrician. He or she can gather the right information and advocate on your child's behalf —a good thing to keep in mind! Don't be afraid to get a second opinion . Good and humble doctors will welcome a second opinion.  Become an expert and an advocate . Knowledge is power. Immerse yourself into learning as much as you can about your child's diagnosis, medication, and treatment plan. Remember to avoid \"internet overload\" by sticking to reputable websites like  HealthyChildren.org . Don't forget to ask your child's doctors where he or she recommends going to learn more. You truly are your child's best advocate. Often, mothers will notice or sense things that others cannot —our maternal instincts are usually right. Ask for help if you need it . It's often hard for moms to ask for help―we want to feel like we can do it all. But, you don't need to be superwoman! Make a list of things people can help you with, and the next time someone asks, let them do one of the things on the list. Take some time for yourself.  You are still a person and need time to recharge. When your child is in the hospital, we know this is especially tough to do. But, you have the most expensive babysitters your child will ever have at your disposal—take a break! Get rest when you can, drink lots of water, and go for a walk once a day. Getting outside of those hospital walls―even for a couple of minutes―will help you feel better. Stay positive . Don't let others' opinions of the situation dictate your emotional well-being. People may say or do offensive things. Learn to let them roll; they just don't know any better and most of the time it's innocent ignorance.  YOU CAN DO THIS!  You are stronger than you think!

        "content": "by: Dr. William R. Otto, MD, FAAP Adenoviruses are a group of viruses that can cause many different types of infections. Currently, more than 50 different adenoviruses have been identified. Adenoviruses infections occur year-round. How and where do adenoviruses spread? Adenoviruses are mainly spread through person-to-person contact, respiratory droplets, and through contact with contaminated surfaces. They can cause infections in people of all ages, but these infections are more common in children under 5 years old.  Young children, especially if they are in daycare, are more likely to come into contact with children who are infected. Children in this age also more likely to put items into their mouths and are less likely to practice good    hand washing . Virus outbreaks have also happened at schools,    summer camps , or at contaminated pools. Once a child is exposed to adenovirus, there is an incubation period of 2 days to 2 weeks before symptoms start. What are the symptoms of adenovirus infections? Most often, an adenovirus infection develops in the respiratory tract. When this happens, symptoms of infection are usually similar to the    common cold .  Children will commonly have a high fever, which may last for several days. Children may have a runny nose or congestion, and some children may develop an ear infection. Some children will have respiratory infections such as bronchiolitis or    pneumonia . A sore throat is another common symptom. Children can also develop symptoms of pinkeye, which is also called conjunctivitis. Some strains of adenovirus will cause infections in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. This can lead to    diarrhea , abdominal cramps, and other symptoms of gastroenteritis. Others may have infection of the bladder, which will cause painful urination and    blood in the urine . In children who have received an organ transplant or who have problems with their immune system, adenoviruses can cause    severe and overwhelming infection . When should you call your doctor? You should call your doctor if you ever have concerns about your child's illness. Important things to look for with adenovirus infections include:\t Fever , particularly fever >104°F or fever for longer than 5 days. Difficulty breathing Symptoms of    dehydration  (less than 3 wet diapers in a 24-hour period) Decreased activity and alertness  Poor sleep or fussiness, chest pain, ear tugging, or ear drainage  How do doctors diagnose adenovirus infection? Your doctor may perform a swab of your child's nose to send special tests for viruses. Tests can also be done on blood, stool, or urine samples. There is no specific medicine to treat adenoviruses and most children recover, so these tests may not be necessary.  What do we know about hepatitis & adenovirus? Since  fall  2021  severe hepatitis (inflamed liver) has been  reported  in children in several states. Most of the children with hepatitis were 5 years old and younger. Their symptoms included gastrointestinal illness, liver injury and liver failure. Nearly half of the children with hepatitis also had adenovirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is looking closely at the reports to find out if the severe hepatitis is related to adenovirus. So, if your child has hepatitis, their pediatrician may test them to rule out possible  adenovirus infection associated with hepatitis .  Are there any treatments for adenovirus infections? There is no specific medical treatment for adenovirus infections, and antibiotics will not work on adenoviruses. There is no good evidence that antiviral drugs work with adenovirus infections in children with normal immune systems.  What can you do to make your child feel better? Treatment is not always needed! If your child's symptoms are not bothering them, then they may not need medicine or home remedies. Remember, fevers help your body's immune system fight infection, so only treat a fever if it is causing your child to be uncomfortable. If your child is having trouble sleeping or has bothersome symptoms (fevers >102°F, severe sore throat, or a hacking cough), then treating their symptoms is warranted. You can do what you would do for any bad cold, including suctioning with nasal saline to allow for better breathing and feeding. A humidifier might help break up mucus and allow your child to breathe easier.  Make sure that your child is able to rest and drinks plenty of fluids. Sometimes your child will not want to eat when they feel sick, but it is important that they drink enough liquids to stay hydrated. If your child is still feeling poorly, acetaminophen or ibuprofen (if your child is older than six months) may help with fever. Do not give aspirin to your child. Talk to your child's doctor before giving over-the-counter cough and cold medicines. Most infections are mild, and children get better with care to help relieve symptoms. However, some children will have a severe infection and will need to be admitted to the hospital. How can you protect your children from adenovirus infections? Wash your hands! Good    hand washing  is the most important thing when trying to prevent adenovirus infections. It is also important to clean and    disinfect  toys and other objects, because adenoviruses can survive for a long time on surfaces. There is no vaccine available to prevent adenovirus infections in children.

These bacteria, called anaerobes, normally live in the GI tract, where there is only a limited amount of oxygen. By definition, the term  anaerobic  means “life without air.”\t Here are brief descriptions of anaerobic infections that sometimes affect children. \t Actinomycosis  (lumpy jaw disease)  is caused most often by a species of bacteria called  Actinomyces.  This infection usually occurs on the face and neck, sometimes after a dental infection or procedure such as a tooth extraction or oral surgery or after trauma to the face. It can also affect other parts of the body, including the abdomen, where it may be related to a perforation of the intestine or trauma in the region. Abscesses (collections of pus) may form when these infections are present. Actinomycosis rarely develops in infants and children.\t Laboratory tests can confirm the presence of  Actinomyces  bacteria. When actinomycosis is diagnosed, your doctor may treat it with intravenous antibiotics (eg, penicillin, ampicillin) for 4 to 6 weeks, followed by high doses of antibiotics taken by mouth for months. \t Bacteroides  and  Prevotella  infections.   Bacterial organisms from species called  Bacteroides  and  Prevotella  are anaerobic. They are common organisms in the mouth, GI tract, and female genital tract. They can cause infections in various parts of the body in children and adults of all ages. The most common are dental infections, inflammation of the abdominal lining (peritonitis), and abscesses within the abdomen, uterus, or tubes. In other regions of the body, these bacteria have been associated with conditions like chronic ear infections, deep skin infections, and lung abscesses.\t Cultures can be collected and sent to the laboratory to identify and confirm the organisms responsible for the infection, determining whether  Bacteroides  or  Prevotella  species are involved. These infections are treated with antibiotics such as clindamycin or metronidazole. In most cases, the bacteria are resistant to penicillin drugs. If an abscess has formed, it may need to be drained using a needle or by surgery.",

The droplets can fall onto hands and then get into eyes and noses.\t The most common symptom associated with  A haemolyticum  is a sore throat, although other symptoms such as a fever, swollen lymph glands, and an itchy skin rash occur frequently as well. The rash begins on the extremities and spreads to the chest and back. It will not be seen on the face, palms, or soles. It looks very similar to the rash of scarlet fever.\t Strep throat is much more common than an  A haemolyticum  infection. If necessary, your pediatrician can do a test to distinguish between a sore throat caused by  A haemolyticum  and one associated with a streptococcal organism.\t Antibacterials, typically erythromycin, can be used to treat this infection.

When the mold becomes airborne in dust, it can make its way into homes through open windows or air vents. In certain children, it can lead to allergic reactions and infections. When aspergillosis causes an allergic reaction, it affects the lungs, triggering symptoms such as wheezing, coughing up of brown mucus, and a low-grade fever. This form of aspergillosis is called allergic aspergillosis and occurs most often in children with chronic asthma or cystic fibrosis.  Aspergillus  species can form fungus balls called aspergillomas. These form within preexisting holes in the lungs. Such holes are found in children who have lung cysts or cystic fibrosis. Aspergillomas can also be found in the lungs of adults with cavities formed during tuberculosis or other types of pneumonia.\t Aspergillus  species can cause severe disease in children whose immune systems are weakened. The lungs are often involved, as are the sinuses and ear canals. This is a serious infection ( invasive  aspergillosis) that often destroys the lungs and can result in death. To diagnose aspergillosis, your pediatrician will evaluate your child’s symptoms. If he has the allergic type of aspergillosis, your pediatrician will order blood tests to measure immunoglobulin E levels and antibodies to the fungus. If your child has an impaired immune system and aspergillosis is suspected, the doctor will order an x-ray film or computed tomography (CT) scan of the infected area. Cultures of sputum or lung tissue are needed to identify the fungus. Treatment for invasive infection involves the use of antifungal medications such as amphotericin B. Treatment of allergic aspergillosis involves steroids as well as antifungal agents.",

        "content": "​Boils, abscess, and cellulitis are bacterial infections of the skin that usually begin from a scratch or  bug bite  and progress to a red nodule that fills with pus. Boils  are superficial infections with a thin layer of skin over fluid.\t Abscesses  are generally larger and deeper than boils with redness and painful swelling over an area filled with pus.\t Cellulitis  is an infection within the skin and the area just beneath it; the skin is red and tender. The area of cellulitis can spread quickly.\t What are the signs or symptoms?  Boils are usually small areas (penny or nickel size) with a thin covering of skin, while abscesses are larger raised areas on the skin that are tender to touch and filled with pus in the deeper tissue. Abscesses and boils may drain when the skin over the infected area opens and lets the fluid or pus out. Signs of cellulitis include areas of redness, skin tenderness, and fever. All of these skin infections are usually warmer than the surrounding normal areas of skin because of the body’s reaction to the infection. What are the incubation and contagious periods?  The incubation period ( the time between being exposed to the disease and when the symptoms start ) is unknown. Common skin bacteria ( staph  and  strep ) are the cause of boils, abscesses, and cellulitis. These bacteria are present on the skin of most children and usually do not cause a problem. However, staph and strep may cause infection when there is a break in the skin or when the bacterial infection becomes more aggressive and overpowers normal defenses against infection. In recent years, a certain type of staph called methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus , or  MRSA  has become a more likely cause of more serious infections. These skin infections are contagious when the infected area is open and drainage is present. People who carry the bacteria in their noses and throats and on their skin may pass the bacteria on to others. However, for an infection to occur, the bacteria must get through a break in the skin.

        "content": "Although botulism is a rare illness, most parents have heard of it and know that it is often related to eating  contaminated food . Botulism can be a very serious disease that can cause abnormal functioning of the nerves, leading to weakness and paralysis. Botulism is caused by poisons (toxins) produced by spore-forming bacteria called  Clostridium botulinum.  Food-borne botulism arises when food becomes contaminated with  C botulinum  spores and then is stored improperly. Improper storage allows the bacteria to grow and make toxins. Outbreaks of this type of botulism have occurred by eating not only home-canned foods, but also restaurant-prepared foods such as patty melts, aluminum foil–wrapped baked potatoes, and bottled garlic. Another form of botulism, so-called wound botulism, can develop when tissues in a child’s wound becomes contaminated with  C botulinum  spores. In certain conditions, the spores can grow within the wound and produce toxins, which then enter the blood stream. ​Preventing Infant Botulism  Infant botulism occurs mostly in babies younger than 6 months. It develops when  C botulinum  spores are eaten by a baby and the bacteria grow in his intestines, making toxins within the gut. The source of the spores is usually unclear. They may be present in soil or dust and then become airborne where they are breathed in and swallowed by the child. Honey is another potential source of the disease-causing spores, however honey should be avoided in children under 12 months of age. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that you do not give honey to a baby younger than 12 months. Honey is safe for children 1 year and older. Food preparation and home canning can be made safer from botulism by following guidelines such as: Boil foods for 10 minutes, which can destroy toxins. Do not feed your child any foods that appear to be spoiled. Discard any food containers that are bulging. They may contain gas produced by C botulinum. There is no vaccine available to prevent botulism. Signs and Symptoms of Botulism In patients for whom botulism is a  food-borne infection , it may progress rapidly. It often begins with feelings of weakness and loss of muscle tone that spread through the body. Children may have: Blurred or double vision A dry mouth Drooping eyelids Difficulty swallowing and speaking The toxin can cause paralysis of the trunk, arms, legs, and respiratory system. In these food-borne infections, symptoms start soon after the contaminated food is eaten—typically within 12 to 48 hours. Infant botulism may range from mild to severe, often beginning with: Constipation A weakened cry Loss of facial expression A reduced gag reflex Slow feeding Overall weakness or floppiness The typical incubation period for infant botulism can range from 3 to 30 days after exposure to the spores. How Is the Diagnosis Made? A child’s symptoms will help your pediatrician diagnose botulism. The diagnosis can be confirmed most often by finding toxin in a youngster’s stool, stomach contents, or the foods he has eaten. To diagnose wound botulism, tissue specimens may be examined in the laboratory. Treatment Much of the treatment for botulism is supportive. Almost all children will need to be hospitalized. Children should be kept well nourished, their airway should be kept clear, and they need to be watched carefully for breathing problems. In special circumstances, your pediatrician may be able to give your child an intravenous antitoxin that blocks the activity of the toxin in his bloodstream. This can help ease symptoms when given early in the infectious process. Antibacterials are not helpful in treating most cases of botulism, although they may be used in the management of wound botulism. Antibacterials generally should not be used in cases of infant botulism. Seriously ill children may need help breathing, using a mechanical ventilator, and eating, using feeding tubes or intravenous feeding. What Is the Prognosis? Most children recover fully from botulism, although it can take several weeks to months. In cases in which the condition is untreated, the symptoms of food-borne botulism sometimes progress to a stage in which the breathing muscles become paralyzed, causing death from respiratory failure.",

        "content": "​By: J. Michael Klatte, MD, FAAP Coxsackieviruses are one of the four kinds of viruses (along with polioviruses, echoviruses, and numbered enteroviruses) that together are known as enteroviruses. These viruses cause a wide variety of illnesses, especially in young children. Infections are most common during summer and early fall. How do coxsackieviruses spread? Coxsackieviruses can be spread through respiratory droplets that becomes airborne by sneezing and coughing. Children may also become infected after touching surfaces or objects contaminated with the virus. Other ways the virus spreads is through contact with the stool of a someone with the infection or from a mother to her infant at birth. The usual amount of time from exposure to the start of symptoms for most coxsackieviruses is 3 to 6 days. Coxsackieviruses can cause children to develop illnesses that include: Infections of the skin and mouth Hand, foot and mouth disease  (HFMD) is an extremely common infection seen in children, and is usually caused by coxsackievirus types A16 and A6. It most often affects infants and children younger than 5 years. The rash of HFMD is known for being located over the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and within the mouth. However, rashes may also be found over the face, arms, legs, and within the diaper area. Symptoms of HFMD can also include fever, headaches and poor appetite. Children with coxsackievirus infections can have herpangina no relation to herpes infections), painful ulcers or sores on the roof of the mouth and tonsils. This infection is typically seen in children between 3 and 10 years of age. Herpangina often develops suddenly, and additional symptoms may include high fevers and headaches. Most cases resolve within 3-6 days.  Muscle infections Infection with coxsackievirus types B3, B5, or B6 can cause repeated sharp spasms in the muscles located between the ribs and over the upper half of the belly. The spasms generally last about 15-30 minutes at a time and are made worse by deep breathing. This infection is usually seen in young adults, and tends to resolve after 1 to 6 days.  Nervous system infections Certain types of coxsackieviruses can cause  meningitis  (infection of the protective layers surrounding the brain and spinal cord). Stiff neck, headache, vomiting, and pain related to bright lights (photophobia) are signs of meningitis. Meningitis occurs most frequently in young children, but older children and teenagers can also be affected.  Heart infections Infections with coxsackievirus types B2 to B5 can cause swelling and inflammation of the heart's muscle and tissue layers, which is known as \"myopericarditis.\" Physically active teenagers are at highest risk for developing myopericarditis. Symptoms can include  chest pain , shortness of breath (especially with exercise), and abnormal heart rhythms.  Infections in newborns Newborns that get enterovirus infections from their mothers at birth may have an  overwhelming infection  with fever that leads to liver failure, heart failure, meningitis,  seizures , bleeding, and sometimes death.  When to call your pediatrician Call your pediatrician if your child complains of neck pain, chest pain, difficulty breathing, listlessness, or lethargy. Also consult your pediatrician if your child has mouth sores that are causing difficulty swallowing, which may lead to dehydration. How are coxsackievirus infections diagnosed? Your pediatrician will conduct a physical examination that evaluates signs and symptoms which may indicate a coxsackievirus infection. If the doctor suspects that your child has hand, foot and mouth disease, your pediatrician will look for the rash associated with this infection as well as for sores in the mouth and throat.  In most cases, the diagnosis is based on clinical findings, and no lab work is done. However, to confirm the diagnosis, your doctor can test samples from the throat, nose, stools, or other areas of your child's body. Tests of the blood, skin lesions (if present) and urine may suggest enterovirus infection. If your pediatrician suspects meningitis, they may perform a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) so that the spinal fluid can be examined in the laboratory. If myopericarditis is suspected, a chest x-ray film and electrocardiogram (EKG) will help with the diagnosis.  How are coxsackievirus infections treated? There is no licensed specific treatment available for coxsackieviruses or any of the other types of enteroviruses. An antiviral drug (pleconaril) has been tested, but is not licensed for general use or available in the United States at this time. Your pediatrician may recommend the use of acetaminophen to reduce your child's fever and ease the discomfort of the mouth sores. What is the prognosis? Almost always, children recover from these infections within 7 to 10 days without problems. Complications do occur on occasion, including heart failure related to myopericarditis and even sudden death related to  abnormal heart rhythms . Newborns with enterovirus infections during the first 1-2 weeks of life can get severe infections leading to liver failure and massive bleeding, which may be fatal. How to prevent coxsackievirus infections Children and adults should adopt good hand-washing habits to reduce the chances of spreading these viruses. In particular, parents and other caregivers who  change baby diapers  should wash their hands frequently.

        "content": "By: Mary T. Caserta, MD, FAAP Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus that belongs to the herpes family, like the one that causes    chickenpox  (varicella zoster virus). CMV is the most common infection acquired before birth—known as a \"congenital\" CMV infection—in the United States. Read on to learn about signs of CMV, ways to treat congenital CMV infection and what to know about CMV in pregnancy. How does CMV affect children? CMV infection is generally mild. Most newborns with  congenital CMV infection  have no signs of illness at birth and remain well. However, they are at risk of    hearing  loss and developmental challenges in infancy and childhood. CMV infection acquired after birth can cause serious illness in people with conditions that affect the immune system. The virus is common in adults, too. Most people with CMV do not have signs or symptoms so they do not know that they have been infected. More than half of adults are infected with CMV by age 40. Once a person is infected, the virus stays in their body for the rest of their life—usually in a resting or inactive state. But the virus can become active and be detected in that person's spit, urine or other body fluids. People can spread it to others through close contact. If the virus becomes active, it can cause illness if the person has a condition or takes medication that affects their immune system. CMV disease In some cases, CMV infection can cause serious problems. About 1 in 5 babies with    congenital CMV infection  will have birth defects or other long-term health issues.  Babies born with congenital CMV infection may have hearing changes or a  learning disability.  \t Newborns may have low birth weight,   jaundice   (yellowing of the skin and eyes), swollen lymph nodes, a small head compared to their body, an enlarged liver or a   skin rash . They may have problems throughout life such as deafness and other   special health needs .\t Infants with congenital CMV infection may not show signs of infection at birth. Still, some may develop hearing loss or other special health needs in childhood. This is not very common. \t Teens who acquire CMV infection may have symptoms similar to infectious  mononucleosis .  These may include fever that lasts more than a few days, sore throat, body aches and fatigue. \t Children with  immune system compromise  may have symptoms that affect their lungs, liver, kidneys, bone marrow or bowels. The infection can also cause problems for children who receive an organ transplant. How CMV spreads CMV infection spreads through contact with body fluids such as spit (saliva), tears, urine and blood. Infections are spread in infants, children and adults at home or  child care , including: during diaper changes. while bathing. during close contact such as kissing, placing an infant's  pacifier in your mouth  or sharing food.\t Ways to lower the risk of spreading CMV infection\t Handwashing. Clean hands before and after feeding or wiping the noses/faces of infants and toddlers, changing diapers or touching objects such as pacifiers that were in contact with saliva. Keep a child's pacifier out of a parent, caregiver or other child's mouth. Avoid sharing cups, utensils and toothbrushes with others.  CMV can also pass from a pregnant person to the fetus through the placenta and cause congenital CMV. It can pass from a pregnant person to their infant through fluids in the birth canal during childbirth and to babies through breastmilk. Healthy newborns and infants who acquire CMV infection during or after birth usually remain well and without any signs of CMV disease. Children who have human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection or whose immune system is not functioning for another reason (for example, because of  cancer treatment ) are at higher risk of problems if they are infected with CMV. How is CMV diagnosed and treated? To diagnose a CMV infection, a pediatrician or other health care clinician may order lab tests of urine, saliva, blood or other body fluids. Fortunately, most children with CMV do not need treatment. Medical treatment is recommended for newborns with congenital CMV who have signs of illness. Even with treatment, babies with CMV infection may have or develop hearing changes or other developmental challenges. Serious CMV infections in children with immune system compromise, such as those with HIV infection or an organ transplant, can be treated with a medicine called ganciclovir or valganciclovir. This medicine is also used to treat newborns with    moderate or severe  congenital CMV disease. Remember Many of us do not know we have a CMV infection. Even without symptoms, we can spread the virus through body fluids like urine and saliva. But there are ways to help reduce the spread of the virus to pregnant people and others who are at risk of serious illness.

        "content": "Editor's Note: This page will be updated with new information as it becomes available. ​In an effort to share accurate information and tips, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) clarifies what Ebola is and what parents can do to protect their children. What is Ebola? Ebola is a viral infection, yet it is very rare and is not easy to transmit from person to person. There is a serious outbreak in West Africa, however, in part due to lack of      germ prevention  and access to adequate medical supplies.   What are the Signs & Symptoms of Ebola? Ebola typically starts suddenly with a      fever  but symptoms can also include a severe      headache , fatigue, muscle pain, weakness,      diarrhea ,      vomiting , stomach pain, or unexplained bleeding or bruising. The time from infection with the virus to the onset of symptoms is from 2 to 21 days      (with 8 to 10 days being most common).  A person with the Ebola virus can infect others as soon as they begin to have symptoms. Early-stage Ebola disease may be confused with other infectious diseases (e.g.,      flu ) because the initial symptoms are similar to those seen with other viral infections.  How is Ebola Spread? Unlike the flu, Ebola is not spread through the air or water. The chances of you or your children becoming infected are slim. Ebola is only transmitted through direct contact with the body fluids of an infected person or from objects like needles that have been in contact with infected body fluids. This means it does not spread through air, food, water, or by touching things like money and keyboards.     \t See Q&A's on Ebola Trans​mission on CDC.gov .   Can You Get Ebola From a Dog or Cat? At this time, there have been no reports of dogs or cats becoming sick with Ebola or being able to spread Ebola to people or animals. The chances of a dog or cat being exposed to Ebola virus in the United States is very low as they would have to come into contact with blood and body fluids of a symptomatic person sick with Ebola.     \t See Q&A's about Ebola and Pets on CDC.gov .​ Can Ebola Be Prevented? Yes, killing the virus is easy. The Ebola virus can be killed with soap and water, heat, or a disinfectant or sanitizing agent. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),      washing hands frequently  is a good precaution. This is perhaps the most important message for children to learn and share. Because people in West Africa may not be able to follow these      precautions  and may not have access to soap and water, Ebola has continued to spread. Important Message for Parents: It is much easier to catch to the flu or      other respiratory viruses  than Ebola. For example, based on the Ebola statistics we have right now, it is likely that flu will cause far more illness and deaths around the globe than Ebola will. News Coverage Understandably, there is      heavy coverage in the media  about the spread of Ebola. However, it is a good idea to limit young children's exposure to news stories about it. This way, parents can decide what information they want to share based on their      child's level of understanding .      Here are some things to remind your children if they are concerned: They are safe. Our health care system is among the best in the world for taking care of sick people. Ebola is rare and does not exist everywhere. When cases are found, the person with the infection is taken to a safe place to be cared for so that he can get better and not make anyone else sick. Doctors and scientists who know a lot about Ebola are working hard to find ways to prevent or cure this illness. Social Media With many children and teens spending a lot of time on social media, there is also the risk that they could read something online about Ebola that they do not understand and may become unnecessarily alarmed. Pay close attention to what your children are seeing online.      Talk to your children  and help them avoid graphic exposure to the media. Keeping Calm News about the spread of diseases can be alarming, even for adults. Keep yourself well informed so that      your own fears are under control . Talk with your children in ways that make sense to them so they don't become overly concerned or afraid.​\t \t  ​Additional Information: \t Ebola, Enterovirus D68 & Flu: Strategies for Child Care, Schools\t Preventing the Flu: Resources for Parents & Child Care Providers\t Hand Washing: A Powerful Antidote to Illness\t Enterovirus: What Parents Need to Know\t Talking To Children About Tragedies and Other News Events\t Ebola FAQs​  (AAP.org)\t Ebola: Resources for Parents, Schools, and Pediatric Healthcare Professionals​  (CDC.gov) \t Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever  (CDC.gov) ​​Additional Resources from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families' Office of Human Services Emergency Preparedness and Response (OHSEPR):\t Ebola: The Facts For Head Start Programs  \t Understanding Ebola: Information for Head Start and Early Head Start Parents  \t Understanding Ebola: Information for Child Care Providers  \t Understanding Ebola: For Parents of Young Children  \t How Do I Talk to My Child About Ebola?  ​ ​",

        "content": "A group of viruses known as enteroviruses, which includes enterovirus D68 ( EV-D68 ), cause about 10 to 15 million infections each year in the United States. Usually, they spread most in the late summer or early fall. Enteroviruses other than EV-D68 can cause childhood illnesses such as  hand, foot & mouth disease ,    meningitis  and encephalitis. EV-D68 can cause respiratory symptoms from the common cold to serious breathing problems.    Signs of EV-D68 range from a routine cold to more serious asthma-like symptoms with wheezing and difficulty breathing. Infants, children with asthma and those with weak immune systems have a greater chance of breathing problems and complications; some requiring treatment in the intensive care unit.    Reports of EV-D68 linked to acute flaccid myelitis  Cases of rhinoviruses and/or enteroviruses (EVs), including EV-D68 in children, have been    reported  across several regions of the country. In children, symptoms of EV-D68 can include severe respiratory illness and has been associated with    acute flaccid myelitis  (AFM), a rare but serious complication involving limb weakness.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is advising parents to contact their child's health care provider right away if their child has trouble breathing or sudden symptoms of limb weakness. Anyone with asthma is at increased risk of serious illness—the CDC is urging that ensure their child's asthma action plan is up to date (see more, below). How EV-D68 spreads EV-D68 is spread by the respiratory route when in contact an infected person. You can also become infected by touching objects or surfaces that have the virus on them and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes. Information for parents of children with asthma This virus is particularly hard on children's lungs. Therefore, it is especially important for parents of children previously diagnosed with asthma to:     Help your child follow their    asthma action plan .   Communicate with your child's pediatrician or subspecialist to plan ahead for times when symptoms may need urgent medical care.   Take prescribed    asthma medications  as directed, especially long-term control medication(s).   Keep the reliever (rescue) medication (inhaler or nebulizer) on hand.   Get the seasonal influenza vaccine as soon as vaccine is available, because an influenza infection in the lungs can trigger asthma attacks and a worsening of asthma symptoms.   Make sure the child's caregiver and/or teacher is aware of his condition, and that they know how to avoid    asthma triggers  and what to do if the child experiences any symptoms related to asthma.   Although no children should be exposed to    secondhand smoke , it is especially important to prohibit smoking in    homes and cars  where children with asthma live. If your child is experiencing symptoms Children with a high fever and those with cold symptoms lasting longer than 7-10 days should talk with their pediatrician.   Those with difficulty breathing or sudden limb weakness should seek emergency care.\t Tips to reduce the risk of EV-D68 infection\t Wash hands  often with soap and water for 20 seconds.  Avoid touching, eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\t Wear a mask  in public—especially if at high risk of serious illness from infections.  Avoid kissing, hugging, and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick.\t Disinfect  frequently touched surfaces, such as toys and doorknobs, especially if someone is sick. Stay home when sick.  Remember, enteroviruses are different from the flu!  To    protect against the flu virus , the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends all children ages six months and older be get their flu vaccine at the earliest possible time.

        "content": "At times, children may become infected with fungi that only rarely infect people. In many instances, the children most susceptible to these infections have weakened immune systems because of cancer, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, organ transplantation, or an HIV infection. However, even children with normal disease-fighting systems can get these infections by breathing in the fungi. Certain organisms can enter the body through cuts or abrasions in the skin. Here are some brief descriptions of some of the fungal diseases that your child could develop. In some cases, they occur so uncommonly that treatment recommendations are not clear, especially for children. Ask your pediatrician for a referral to a pediatric infectious disease specialist if your youngster is diagnosed with one of the following fungal infections:\t Hyalohyphomycosis\t Fungi from the  Fusarium  species may cause this infection. These fungi can enter the body through the respiratory tract, sinuses, or skin. It may cause signs and symptoms associated with a sinus infection (sinusitis), a urinary tract infection, a blood infection, or meningitis. These infections may occur in children with weakened immune systems. Your pediatrician will diagnose hyalohyphomycosis by taking a blood culture or tissue specimen and having it tested in the laboratory. High-dose amphotericin B or fluconazole have been used in treating hyalohyphomycosis.  Malassezia  species cause a common, superficial skin infection known as tinea versicolor or pityriasis versicolor. The skin of the face, torso, arms, and neck is covered with many round and scaly red areas. These areas fail to tan during the summer, but are relatively darker in the winter. The infection is most common in teenagers and young adults. Your pediatrician will make the diagnosis based on the appearance of the rash. A culture can be taken, if needed. Selenium sulfide lotion or shampoo is used for treatment. Ketoconazole shampoo is also effective, as are several other antifungals that are applied directed onto the affected area. Oral antifungals such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole have been shown to be effective in adults. These drugs are used less commonly in children.\t Penicilliosis\t Children infected with HIV may be susceptible to a fungal disease called penicilliosis caused by  Penicillium marneffei.  This fungus is found in soil and decaying vegetation as well as in the air. It can cause signs and symptoms such as lung inflammation (pneumonitis) and acne-like skin lesions on the face, torso, arms, and legs. Your pediatrician may have a blood culture or tissue sample tested in the laboratory as part of the diagnostic process. Amphotericin B or itraconazole are commonly prescribed treatments for penicilliosis.\t Phaeohyphomycosis\t Phaeohyphomycosis is a large category of fungal infections that are caused by organisms from the  Bipolaris, Curvularia, Exserohilum, Pseudallescheria,  and  Scedosporium  species. These infections often involve the skin and, in some cases, the nasal passages and sinuses. They also can infect the brain, bones, and heart (endocarditis). Superficial infections can occur in children with healthy immune defenses, while more serious infections occur in children with weakened immune systems. To make the diagnosis, your doctor will order tests that examine affected tissues under the microscope. The pediatrician may also take cultures of the tissue to try to grow the fungi in the laboratory. Your child’s doctor will recommend treatment with medicines such as itraconazole or amphotericin B or the surgical removal of infected tissue.\t Trichosporonosis\t Children with weakened immune systems are susceptible to trichosporonosis, which can infect the lung, heart, or bloodstream. The fungus  Trichosporon beigelii,  which can produce skin lesions on the torso, face, and arms, causes trichosporonosis. Other symptoms include a cough, fever, and bloody sputum. This organism is found in soil and can enter the body through the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal system, or skin wounds.When it infects humans, it is potentially life threatening. Treatment typically involves the use of amphotericin B or fluconazole.\t Zygomycosis\t As with many other fungal infections, zygomycosis is most likely to occur in children with weakened immune systems. It may develop in children with leukemia, lymphoma, or diabetes and those who have used nonsterile bandages on wounds or cuts. Zygomycosis is caused by fungi from the  Rhizopus, Mucor, Absidia,  and  Rhizomucor  species and can cause nose and sinus infections. Affected children may have a fever, nasal congestion, and sinus discomfort. If the infection spreads, it can affect the lungs and brain and, in the worst cases, cause pneumonia, infection of the brain, seizures, paralysis, and death. This infection is diagnosed with laboratory tests examining nasal discharges and phlegm, as well as by conducting biopsies of, for example, lung lesions. Treatment includes surgical removal of the infected tissue, if possible, and use of medicines such as high-dose amphotericin B.",

        "content": "By: Elizabeth Williams, MD, FAAP\t If your child has ever had a throat or skin infection, it may have been caused by group A streptococcal (Group A Strep) bacteria. Group A strep bacteria can be extremely contagious. It can cause a variety of infections, typically mild but occasionally severe.  What infections does group A strep cause?    Strep throat  The most common group A strep infection is    strep throat , which usually causes fever and sore throat without viral illness symptoms such as runny nose and cough. Strep throat is especially common among school-aged children and teenagers.    Skin infections Group A strep organisms can cause skin infections such as    impetigo  (itchy, red, oozing sores) and cellulitis (red, swollen, painful skin).    Scarlet fever Group A strep bacteria can cause an infection called  scarlet fever . This infection is basically strep throat with a rash, which is caused by a toxin the bacteria releases into the body. Severe infections Rarely, group A strep can cause serious infections that require immediate medical attention and even intensive care. These include: Necrotizing fasciitis .  Symptoms of this severe skin infection include deep soft-tissue pain and low blood pressure. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome .  Symptoms include low blood pressure, increased heart rate, fast breathing and infections of the blood (sepsis) or lungs (pneumonia). When to call your pediatrician If your child has a sore throat, fever and swollen glands, especially without a runny nose or cough, call your pediatrician. How long is the incubation period for group A strep? An infected child will usually start feeling sick 2 to 5 days after being exposed to streptococcal bacteria. How is group A strep diagnosed in children? If your child has a sore throat and fever without symptoms of viral infection, your health care provider may swab your child's throat to test for Group A Strep infection. Some pediatricians' offices have quick-result strep tests that can help diagnose streptococcal infection in several minutes. A throat culture may be used, but this takes a few days.  How is a group A strep infection treated? The primary treatment for sore throats caused by Group A Strep is penicillin, an antibiotic that's taken orally. Amoxicillin also works well, and there are other antibiotics that can be used in case of a sever penicillin allergy. Skin infection caused by group A strep may be treated with antibiotic ointment, or sometimes with oral or IV antibiotics. How long should my child stay home with a group A strep infection? If your child has a throat or skin infection caused by group A strep bacteria, they can go back to school or child care once they've had two doses of a course of an appropriate antibiotic 12 hours apart without fever. How can I help my child feel better? Home remedies such as gargling with warm salt water may relieve some of your child's throat pain.  Acetaminophen or ibuprofen  or can lower your child's temperature and lessen the pain. How long does it take to recover from group A strep infection? When antibiotics are given to treat the most common group A strep infection, most children improve within a few days.

        "content": "Group B streptococcus (GBS) is bacteria that can cause serious illness, particularly in newborns. It is responsible for many cases of      meningitis , an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, in infants, as well as some cases of blood infections (sepsis) and      pneumonia . \t Early onset disease infections  occur within the first week of life. These babies typically contract GBS from their mothers before or during birth.            Premature newborns  are more likely to develop GBS infections than full-term infants. \t Late onset disease infections  occur a bit later, after a week of age, and through the first 3 months of life. Bacteria can be contracted from the mother, other children, family members, and other caregivers.​ Signs and Symptoms: A baby infected with GBS may have symptoms such as:  Fever Feeding difficulties Irritability Lethargy\t ​A pregnant woman should speak with her doctor about her GBS status. A woman who has GBS in her body typically does not feel sick, but she is at increased risk of passing the bacteria to her baby during birth. Sometimes, however, these women may have urinary tract or blood infections while pregnant. \t When to call your pediatrician: If your newborn has any of the above symptoms, contact your pediatrician at once. How the diagnosis is made: If your doctor thinks that your baby could have a GBS infection, the pediatrician will take a culture from the infant's blood or spinal fluid and send it to the laboratory for testing and diagnosis. The pediatrician may also take a chest x-ray to confirm a diagnosis of pneumonia.  Treatment: Newborns with GBS infections should be treated with intravenous antibiotics such as ampicillin, gentamicin, penicillin, or another         antibiotic  such as a cephalosporin. Prevention: Early onset GBS infections in newborns can often be prevented if infected pregnant women take intravenous (never by mouth) antibiotics when they are giving birth, typically when labor begins. \t  ​About 1 out of every 4 (about 25%) pregnant women carry GBS bacteria in their rectum or vagina. Those women are considered GBS positive. A woman may test positive for the bacteria at some times and not others. That's why the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obestetricians and Gynecologists recommend that all pregnant women to be tested for GBS bacteria in the vagina and rectum between 35 to 37 weeks of every pregnancy. Unfortunately, treating the mother does not prevent late onset infections. \t There are currently no vaccines against GBS infections, although several are being studied.

        "content": "​Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a common childhood virus that pediatricians, child care centers and preschools see in summer and early fall.  Most parents want to know what exactly hand, foot, and mouth disease is, how to help their child cope with the discomfort it causes, and most of all when their child can go back to child care or school.  Read on for answers to these and more frequently asked questions. What is hand, foot, and mouth disease?  Despite its scary name, hand, foot, and mouth disease is a common, contagious illness caused by different viruses. It typically affects infants and children under age 5, but older kids and adults can catch it as well.  What are the signs and symptoms?  From the time the child is exposed to hand, foot, and mouth disease ,  it takes 3 to 6 days for the first    symptoms to show up.  This is called the  incubation period.  It usually starts with a  fever ,  sore throat , and runny nose—much like the  common cold —but then a rash with tiny blisters may start to show up on the following body sites:​  In the mouth  On the inner cheeks Gums Sides of the tongue  Top of the mouth Fingers Palms of hands Soles of feet Buttocks  Note:  One, few, or all of these body sites may have blisters.  Symptoms are the worst in the first few days but are usually completely gone within a week.   Peeling of the fingers and toes after 1 to 2 weeks can happen, but it is harmless. How is hand, foot, and mouth disease diagnosed?  Your pediatrician can tell if your child has hand, foot, and mouth disease based on the symptoms you describe and by looking at your child's mouth sores and rash. Depending on how severe your child's symptoms are, your pediatrician may collect samples from your child's throat send them to a lab for testing. If your child is diagnosed with hand, foot, and mouth disease, make sure to inform your child's child care provider or school.  They may need to inform other parents and staff members about watching for symptoms.  What is the treatment? There isn't any medicine to treat or cure hand, foot, and mouth disease. The only thing parents can do is ease the fever and pain with  acetaminophen  or  ibuprofen .  Call your pediatrician if your child's fever lasts more than 3 days or if he or she is not drinking fluids.   For mouth pain: In children over age 1 year, parents can consult with their doctor as a variety of liquid mouth-soothing remedies may be useful to alleviate mouth ulcer pain. Do not use regular mouth washes, because they sting. Age 1 to 6 years:  Put a few drops in your child's mouth or put it on with a cotton swab. Age over 6 years:  Use 1 teaspoon (5 mL) as a mouth wash. Keep it on the mouth blisters as long as possible. Then have your child spit it out or swallow it. Avoid dehydration:  Children with hand, foot, and mouth disease need to drink plenty of fluids. Call your pediatrician now or go to the ER if you suspect your child is dehydrated.  See  Signs of Dehydration in Infants & Children  for more information.   How long is it contagious?  You are generally most contagious during the first week of illness. But, children with hand, foot, and mouth disease may shed the virus from the respiratory tract (nose, mouth and lungs) for 1-3 weeks and in the stool for weeks to months after the infection starts.  How is hand, foot, and mouth disease spread?  The virus causing hand, foot, and mouth disease is usually spread through person-to-person contact in different ways:  Respiratory route:  Contact with large droplets that form when a child talks, coughs, or sneezes. These droplets can land on or be rubbed into the eyes, nose, or mouth. Most of these droplets do not stay in the air; usually, they travel no more than 3 feet and fall onto the ground.  Contact with the respiratory secretions (nasal mucus or saliva) from objects contaminated by children who carry these viruses.  Fecal-oral route: Contact with stool of children who are infected. This generally involves a sick child dirtying his own fingers and then touching an object that another child touches. The child who touched the contaminated surface then puts her fingers into her own mouth. How can I help prevent and control the spread of hand, foot, and mouth disease?  Teach your children to cover their mouths and noses when sneezing or coughing with a disposable tissue, if possible, or with an arm sleeve if no tissue is available. Teach everyone to  wash their hands  right after using tissues or having contact with mucus. Change or cover contaminated clothing. Wash your hands after changing diapers. Parents can spread the virus to other surfaces by coming in contact with any feces, blister fluid or saliva.  Clean, rinse, and sanitize  toys that may have come in contact with your child's saliva.  Prevent sharing of food, drinks, and personal items that may touch your child's mouth, such as eating utensils, toothbrushes, and towels. Protect other children in the house. Make sure they do not come in close contact with the child who is infected. Kissing, hugging, and sharing cups and utensils can spread the infection quickly. If your children share a room, separate them while the sick child is contagious.  Disinfect  any surfaces your child touches frequently—this may be helpful to prevent a sibling from getting hand, foot, and mouth disease (and it is doable if you're are careful about cleaning surfaces).  Can my child go to school or child care with hand, foot, and mouth disease?  Yes, except for when:  The child is not feeling well enough to participate in class or has a fever.  The teacher or child care provider feels he or she cannot take care of the child without compromising care for the other children in the class. Excessive drooling from mouth sores might be a problem that people find difficult to manage.  The child has many open blisters. It usually takes about 7 days for the blisters to dry up.  The child meets other exclusion criteria.   Note:  Exclusion from child care or school will not reduce the spread of hand, foot, and mouth disease because children can spread the virus even if they have no symptoms and the virus may be present in the stool for weeks after the symptoms are gone  When can my child go back to school or child care?  A child can return to school or child care after all of the exclusion criteria  (listed above)  are resolved and the child feels well enough to participate. Talk with your child's pediatrician if you are not sure when your child should return to school or child care. If my child has already had hand, foot, and mouth disease can he or she get it again? Yes. A child can have repeat infections with the same type of virus or different viruses that cause hand, foot, and mouth disease.

        "content": "By: Maria Oliva-Hemker, MD, FAAP\t   Inside the lower part of the digestive system, trillions of tiny microbes help us get nutrients from food, fight off infection and much more. Together, these organisms form the    gut microbiome  that regulates our health at every stage of life. Unfortunately, many things can disrupt this microbial ecosystem, including the antibiotics we sometimes take for bacterial infections. This can cause serious issues for children, especially those who have chronic health conditions. These kids are vulnerable to an infection known as    Clostridioides difficile  (also called CDI or  C diff ). When antibiotics don't work to get rid of C. diff  As its name suggests,  C diff  can be extremely hard to cure. Typical symptoms include diarrhea and abdominal pain. Although children are less likely to have severe  C diff  infection, serious cases can be life-threatening, causing symptoms such as high fever, diarrhea, severe abdominal pain and bloody stools. Standard treatments, which include specific antibiotics, work for many kids who get  C diff . But others face stubborn infections that keep coming back. For them, a treatment known as fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) may be the answer. Helping the gut microbiome heal itself When parents hear about FMT, some can't quite imagine how this procedure can help kids get well. After all, we spend a lot of time teaching kids to wipe carefully and wash their hands after using the bathroom, since the harmful bacteria in feces (poop) can make us sick! As it turns out, stool taken from a healthy donor can help restore the \"good\" bacteria in your child's gut microbiome—the ones that antibiotics may have wiped out. These bacteria can also be killed when children undergo chemotherapy or gastrointestinal surgery, or if they have serious gut health issues. How effective is FMT? In a  report  examining the evidence behind FMT the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) confirms it is a viable treatment option for kids with severe or recurrent  C diff . Decades of evidence show that FMT is highly effective in adult cases of  C diff , with success rates of 80% to 90%. Findings from hundreds of pediatric cases suggest that FMT works equally well for kids. Is FMT safe and comfortable for children?  If FMT has been recommended for your child, you may have lots of questions. Here are some helpful things to know.  The stool used in FMT comes only from healthy donors who are thoroughly screened for communicable diseases and chronic health problems. Several rounds of lab tests are conducted before the stool is approved for transplantation.  Though some medical centers have their own sources, many work with stool banks that operate under regulations set by the Food and Drug Administration.  Most transplants are done as outpatient procedures so your child can go home the same day. Kids usually experience no side effects. Some notice gurgling sounds in their abdomen or have mild gas.  There is little to no odor, even when a nasogastric (NG) tube is used to infuse the healthy microbes into your child's system. In this case, the medical team may let your child pick out a scent—such as a favorite candy—that is rubbed on their upper lip to mask any minor traces of odor.  Other transplant methods use the same tools and procedures as a colonoscopy or enema. Kids are sedated (under anesthesia) during a colonoscopy to make the procedure easier for them.   How much does FMT cost? Standard treatments for  C diff  involve antibiotics that can be very expensive. Surprisingly, many families find that FMT costs less than these medicines. Your family's health insurance plan may cover FMT procedures for children. Ask your medical team for help navigating the financial aspects of FMT so you know what to expect.     Why do-it-yourself fecal transplants are NOT safe for your child    A surge of interest in FMT has motivated some people to try doing their own fecal transplants, using information from the internet and social media. Many believe this is a \"natural\" cure they can do at home with stool from someone they know. But this means the donor and stool have not been thoroughly screened and tested to reduce the risks of passing on a communicable disease or chronic health problem.  The AAP strongly urges families to trust their children's health to medical centers and professionals who have in-depth experience with fecal transplants. DIY transplants are NEVER a safe option for kids.   Talk with your pediatrician Your child's doctor is ready to talk with you about all aspects of your child's gut health, including symptoms that might point to a  C diff  infection. If you have questions about FMT or any aspect of your child's digestive health, get in touch with your pediatrician today.

        "content": "The threat of bioterrorism has been on the minds of many parents, particularly since September 2001. Several infectious organisms have the potential to be used in acts of terrorism, and children are particularly vulnerable to these germs.  Children have a more rapid breathing rate and tend to be more sensitive to many infectious diseases and toxins. Additionally, a young child's inability to describe symptoms to their parents might delay appropriate treatment.  Here are some of the most common germs that could be used in a terrorist attack.  Anthrax Anthrax is a serious infection caused by a bacterium called Bacillus anthracis. In 2001, 22 cases of the disease were reported in the United States after anthrax spores were sent through the mail. Because of this, most Americans are now aware of the infection and its possible use as a biological weapon.  At the same time, naturally occurring anthrax infections in humans or animals remain very rare in the United States. Both 2000 and 2001 had one such case of this form of anthrax. These natural infections in humans can be spread through contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products such as hides, wool, hair, and undercooked meat.  Signs and Symptoms Anthrax bacteria can be contracted in 3 ways. Each type of infection has its own set of signs and symptoms. Although the skin sores are infectious, person-to-person transmission of any type of anthrax is rare.  Breaks in the skin (cutaneous anthrax):  anthrax spores (dry resting forms of the bacteria that can survive in soil for decades) enter the skin through a cut or abrasion, causing swollen, itchy sores or bumps on the skin. Within a day or two, the center becomes thick and black. In most cases, surprisingly, the sore is not painful.  Breathed in (inhalational anthrax):  Develops when a child breathes anthrax spores into his lungs. Early symptoms are similar to those of the flu, including fever, chills, cough, chest pain, headaches, muscle pain, and weakness. Two to 5 days later, the symptoms get worse as the bacteria move through the body and may include excessive sweating, bleeding, a bluish tint to the skin from not receiving enough oxygen, serious breathing difficulties, confusion, and shock.  Most children will die of disease if it gets to this stage.  Swallowing (gastrointestinal anthrax):  Can be caused when a child eats undercooked meat from an infected animal. Its symptoms include nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, and fever. As the child's condition gets worse, he may have severe stomach pain, bloody diarrhea, and vomiting of blood. Some children have sores in their mouths and throats and swelling of their necks.  The incubation period for all forms of anthrax is usually less than 2 weeks, although it can be as long as 2 months for the inhalation variety. How Is the Diagnosis Made? If a pediatrician believes an anthrax infection may be present in a child, he may order special diagnostic laboratory tests of a child's blood, respiratory fluids (sputum), or skin lesions. If inhalational anthrax is suspected, he will likely place the child in the hospital and recommend a chest x-ray film or a computed tomography scan to look more closely at the lungs and other areas inside the chest. Pediatricians are required to report any suspected cases of anthrax to public health officials. Treatment An anthrax infection needs to be treated right away. Naturally occurring cutaneous anthrax is typically treated with a variety of antibiotics such as penicillin or doxycycline for 7 to 10 days.  In the cases of anthrax associated with bioterrorism in 2001, doctors often prescribed the oral antibiotic ciprofloxacin or doxycycline. Although drugs such as ciprofloxacin and tetracycline are generally not recommended for use in children, they may be appropriate choices in serious infections in which the benefits of these antibiotics outweigh any real or possible side effects. However, the drugs such as ciprofloxacin or tetracycline that are usually given to adults for these anthrax infections are prescribed more cautiously in children and pregnant women because of safety concerns. For inhalational and gastrointestinal infections, a pediatrician may first recommend that antibiotics be given intravenously in the hospital. Treatment for these more serious infections usually lasts 2 months or longer. What Is the Prognosis? When treatment for anthrax is provided early, it is usually effective. However, if the infection is untreated, it is very serious and can cause death. Of the 3 types of anthrax infections, inhalational anthrax is the most dangerous. This type of anthrax can prove to be deadly within days after symptoms appear in as many as half of those with the infection. By contrast, cutaneous anthrax poses a very small risk of death. In fact, deaths are rare when cutaneous and gastrointestinal anthrax infections are treated right away. Prevention An anthrax vaccine is available in the United States. However, it is not approved for children or pregnant women because it has not been tested enough in these groups. Newer, more efficient anthrax vaccines with fewer side effects are currently being studied. Important Message for Parents:  Do  not  give your child antibiotics as a preventive measure because you are afraid that he might be exposed to anthrax at some time in the future. Antibiotics can lead to resistance in bacteria, which makes them less effective. They can also sometimes cause serious side effects. A pediatrician should prescribe these medicines only if a child has actually come in contact with anthrax bacteria. If your pediatrician thinks your child has been exposed to anthrax spores, he may consider prescribing preventive antibiotics against inhalation anthrax. If a terrorist attack should occur, pediatricians will decide whether antibiotics should be used as a preventive measure. Plague  Once called \"Black Death,\" plague killed millions of people in earlier times before the discovery of antibiotics. In the 1300s, it was responsible for the deaths of 20 to 30 million people in Europe. Although improvements in living conditions and rodent control have dramatically reduced the number of cases today, there are still 1,000 or more new cases worldwide each year, including some in the United States.  The bacteria responsible for plague are called Yersinia pestis. Cases of naturally occurring plague, usually acquired from close contact with wild animals who can carry the bacteria, have been reported in several western states in the United States. The disease occurs in rural areas and the incidence tends to be higher in the summers. Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague, and it infects the lymph nodes. It can be spread to humans in the following ways:  When a person is bitten by fleas that have fed on infected rodents (most often, rats) or animals such as pet cats and dogs that have been in close contact with rodents.  When a person comes in contact with the tissues and body fluids of infected rodents and other animals, including pets. The germs typically enter the human body through a cut or abrasion in the skin.  When a person is bitten by an infected animal such as a ground squirrel or prairie dog.  Person-to-person transmission can occur from contact with drainage from infected lymph nodes or by breathing in tiny droplets coughed up by patients with lung infection. Other forms of the disease can be spread to humans in the following ways: Although septicemic plague, which affects the bloodstream, occurs most often as a complication of bubonic plague, it can occur from direct contact. Once bacteria invade the bloodstream, the disease can cause serious illness. Primary pneumonic plague infecting the lungs is spread when an individual breathes in airborne droplets from a person or animal with the plague. It can lead to pneumonia. There have been recent concerns about the possible use of Y pestis in bioterrorism, because it can be spread through the air. Signs and Symptoms Common symptoms associated with bubonic plague, as well as other forms of plague, include:  Fever Painful, swollen lymph nodes called buboes Buboes (swollen, tender lymph glands) tend to develop in the groin area or regions of the armpit or neck, the lymph nodes that are designed to trap bacteria coming up the leg, or arm, or face, respectively.  Chills Headache Extreme weakness or exhaustion When a person has plague that infects the bloodstream (septicemic) and spreads through the body, it can cause serious problems such as low blood pressure and breathing difficulties. Pneumonic plague can have serious complications as well, such as a cough, breathing difficulties, and bloody sputum. The incubation period for bubonic plague is always less than a week and possibly as little as 2 days.  Important Message for Parents:  Contact your pediatrician if a wild rodent bites your child or if she develops symptoms like those described above.  How Is the Diagnosis Made? Plague is usually diagnosed with laboratory tests that can detect Y pestis, including evaluations of samples from sputum and the lymph nodes, as well as blood specimens. Treatment Children with plague are most often treated with very effective antibiotics, such as gentamicin, given as a shot. In some cases, other drugs like doxycycline may be chosen instead. This treatment usually continues for 7 to 10 days or until several days after the fever breaks. A pediatrician may recommend draining the pus from lymph nodes in children with bubonic plague. What Is the Prognosis? If treatment is given promptly, it can keep plague from getting worse. If not properly treated, however, the disease can result in death related to infections in the lungs and bloodstream. Prevention If you live in parts of the United States where plague has been reported, such as the southwest, take steps to lower your risks for the disease.  Do not leave out pet food that can attract rodents.  Remove brush and rock piles that can serve as rodent nesting sites.  Use insecticides to destroy fleas.  Regularly treat the family pets to remove fleas.  Tell children to avoid any contact with sick and dead animals. Important Message for Parents:  If your child has had close contact with a person with plague, or someone who recently handled a dead animal, call your pediatrician if she develops a fever or other symptoms that may indicate that she has become infected. Antibiotics may be prescribed as a preventive (prophylactic) measure in these cases. Although plague has not been used as a bioterrorist weapon, government officials have noted its possible use in this way. If the threat ever turns into reality, guidelines may be issued on steps to take to protect your child. There is no vaccine presently available to protect against plague. Smallpox In 1980, the World Health Organization declared that smallpox had been eliminated worldwide. In the United States, doctors stopped giving routine smallpox vaccines to children in 1971. After the terrorist attacks of September 2001, however, concern about smallpox reemerged because the disease is considered a possible weapon for use in a bioterrorist attack. As a result, even though the smallpox vaccine is not recommended for universal use, public health officials are developing recommendations for when such a vaccine should be given. The variola virus, part of a family of viruses called Poxviridae, causes smallpox. It is highly contagious and is spread by airborne saliva droplets from an infected person. In a small number of cases, it can be spread by direct contact with a smallpox lesion, clothing, or bed linens. Only humans can get smallpox. Signs and Symptoms A child with smallpox will develop the illness after a 7- to 17-day incubation period. He will become so severely ill that he'll be left bedridden with symptoms such as: A high fever (102°F–104°F or 38.9°C–40.0°C) Severe headaches Backache Abdominal pain Physical exhaustion Vomiting Seizures After about 2 to 5 days, the child will develop blisters or ulcers in the mouth or throat. At this point, he will become contagious and able to spread the infection. In the next 24 hours, a rash will develop, usually beginning on the face and spreading rapidly to the forearms, torso, and legs. This rash will progress to raised bumps and then pus-filled blisters that soon become crusty. Rarely, the blisters will be filled with blood. Scabs will form, which will fall off approximately 3 to 4 weeks later, sometimes leaving behind pitted scars. About 3 to 4 weeks after the rash first appears, the scabs will separate. At this point, the child will no longer be contagious. Important Message for Parents:  If your child develops this illness, especially a rash with a fever, contact your pediatrician right away. Early chickenpox can be confused with smallpox, but the rashes look very different and children with chickenpox are usually not very sick-appearing. The blisters of chickenpox are more concentrated on the face and torso than the arms and legs. The rashes appear in waves rather than all at once and are in different stages of development at the same time (e.g., bumps, blisters, scabs). Chickenpox is more delicate, and appears to be on top of the skin rather than more deep in the skin. How Is the Diagnosis Made? A doctor will suspect smallpox if the symptoms described previously are present, particularly the characteristic rash associated with the infection. Diagnostic tests for smallpox, which include analyzing fluid from the rash and blisters, can only be conducted at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If a child or adult is suspected of having smallpox, health departments will be contacted immediately, as the only way that smallpox can occur now, is from a bioterror exposure. Treatment Currently, no effective treatment is available for smallpox. An antiviral medicine called cidofovir may be useful, but has not been tested in actual cases. Children and adults with the infection will be given supportive treatment such as intravenous fluids in the hospital, as well as medication to manage fever and other symptoms. Patients and their close contacts will immediately be placed in isolation, so they will not spread the infection to others. What Is the Prognosis? Before modern medicine, the reported death rate was as high as 30% in infants before their first birthdays and adults older than 30. Nevertheless, the majority of children and adults with this disease recover, although they may be left with scars associated with the rash. Prevention Immunizations against smallpox are not presently recommended for the general public, and the vaccine is not available from a pediatrician. Military personnel and first responders such as ambulance drivers, emergency medical technicians, some nurses, and doctors have received the vaccine. In the United States, the government has stockpiled large supplies of smallpox vaccine to be used in an emergency, including a smallpox-related terrorist attack, if it should ever occur. The vaccine can reduce the seriousness of a smallpox infection or even prevent it if it is administered within 4 days after a person has been exposed to the variola virus. However, the vaccine itself has potentially serious side effects. Hemorrhagic Fevers Caused by Arenaviruses A family of viruses called arenaviruses is responsible for causing lymphocytic choriomeningitis and 5 hemorrhagic (bleeding) fevers—Bolivian, Argentine, Sabia-virus associated, Venezuelan, and Lassa. In some parts of the world, especially South America and the African continent, these infections are much more common, but they can be seen in the United States. Lassa fever, for example, occurs primarily in West Africa, but has been diagnosed in the United States among people who have traveled to Africa. Arenaviruses are carried by rodents and can be spread to humans who breathe in tiny particles of the virus or have skin contact with the urine or saliva of the rodents. The virus then enters the body through a cut or scratch. Signs and Symptoms:  Some hemorrhagic fever infections cause only mild illness, but in other cases, they can be much more serious. At times, they can be fatal.  An infection with an arenavirus often begins with symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, eye pain, and abdominal pain.  Respiratory tract symptoms, including a sore throat and cough, can occur in people with Lassa fever.  Arenavirus infections can also cause bleeding from the mucous membranes (the nose and mouth) and red spots and blotches on the skin called petechiae and purpura that indicate bleeding under the skin.  In the most severe infections, patients can develop shock about 7 to 9 days after the illness begins. Other serious findings may include seizures, tremors, and changes in consciousness. Person-to-person transmission through body fluids or respiratory secretions is uncommon, but can occur. The incubation periods for the arenavirus diseases are about 1 to 2 weeks. How Is the Diagnosis Made? Children and adults suspected of having hemorrhagic fever can be tested for antibodies to the virus, and a test for the virus in the bloodstream or on mucus membranes can be sent to the CDC. Treatment: Sometimes an antiviral medication called ribavirin  (approved by the FDA for treatment of hepatitis B virus) , given intravenously, is used to lower the death rate among people with severe Lassa fever, especially if the medicine is given during the first week of the illness. Ribavirin also may be helpful in treating other types of arenaviruses. Transfusions of plasma from patients who have recovered from arenavirus infection are sometimes given as part of the treatment. Prevention: The best way to avoid arenaviruses is to keep away from rodents that may carry the disease. Make efforts to prevent rodents from entering homes and nesting in areas near people. Argentine and possibly Bolivian hemorrhagic fever can be prevented with a vaccine that is still being studied. No vaccines are available for other hemorrhagic fevers associated with arenaviruses. Do not allow your child to be in close contact with people already infected with a hemorrhagic fever virus. In case of a bioterrorist attack involving arenaviruses, follow the instructions from public health officials to reduce your family's risk of exposure.  Talking to Children about Bioterrorism  In the event of bioterrorism, knowing  how to talk to your child , along with  helping your child cope , will be critical. In general, it is best to share basic information with children, not graphic details, or unnecessary information about tragic circumstances.

        "content": "Listeriosis is a serious infection caused by a bacteria called    Listeria monocytogenes . About 1,600 people get    listeriosis  each year, usually after eating contaminated food. Pregnant people, newborns and children with weakened immune systems and adults over age 65 years are at higher risk if they get infected. Pregnant people can spread the bacteria across the placenta and infect the fetus. If a person becomes infected early in pregnancy, they are at high risk of miscarriage. Late in pregnancy, the infection can cause stillbirth or, at times, serious illness or death in the newborn shortly after delivery. Listeriosis rarely causes serious problems for healthy children.   How common is    Listeria ? \t L monocytogenes  bacteria are   found in the environment. Like other viruses, parasites and bacteria,    Listeria  can contaminate food and cause food poisoning.    Some foods that get contaminated with    Listeria  more often include: soft cheeses (such as feta, Brie, Camembert), unpasteurized milk, processed meat (such as hot dogs, deli meat, pâté), undercooked poultry and unwashed raw vegetables.      Listeria  outbreak linked to deli meats All Boar's Head pre-packaged and sliced deli meats are recalled. As of Aug. 28, 2024, at least 57 people in 18 states have been infected with an outbreak strain of  Listeria monocytogenes . Of those who got sick, 57 were hospitalized and eight people died. This is the largest listeriosis outbreak since 2011. Anyone who is at higher risk for getting sick with  Listeria  should avoid eating meats sliced at deli counters, unless heated to an internal temperature of 165°F or until steaming hot just before serving. Do not eat  recalled deli products . Throw them away or contact the store about returns. Clean your refrigerator, containers, and surfaces that may have touched the recalled deli meats. (More information  here .) What are symptoms of listeriosis?\t Listeria  symptoms can include fever and    diarrhea . People rarely become seriously ill; most recover on their own without medical care. Symptoms usually begin within 24 hours after eating the contaminated food and can last two to three days. \t Severe illness  is less common and develops one to four weeks after eating contaminated food, sometimes later. Serious childhood cases of listeriosis can lead to    meningitis . Listeriosis can be serious for pregnant people and cause pregnancy loss or premature birth. In pregnant people, symptoms may include fever, fatigue, muscle aches and intestinal problems, or they may have no symptoms of infection. Infections also can be serious or deadly for infants. Symptoms of    listeriosis  in an infant may include: Listlessness (sleepy, drowsy, sluggish) Vomiting Loss of appetite Yellow color of the skin and eyes ( jaundice ) Skin rash Breathing problems How is listeriosis diagnosed & treated? Listeriosis   is detected through laboratory testing of blood, urine and cerebrospinal (from the brain and spine) fluid. If your pediatrician suspects that your newborn may have listeriosis, the placenta or amniotic fluid can be tested for the germ. When listeriosis   is diagnosed in a pregnant person, treatment of the infection can prevent the spread of infection to the fetus or newborn. Antibacterial medication also can be used to treat    L monocytogenes  infections in infants. How to prevent listeriosis Those at increased risk for listeriosis should follow food safety steps to avoid infection: Eat or serve only thoroughly cooked food from animal sources. Check the label of dairy products and do not eat the food unless the label says it is pasteurized. Avoid    raw (unpasteurized) milk and foods  made from it (for example, unpasteurized soft cheeses like feta, brie and queso fresco).  Wash raw vegetables. Store ready-to-eat foods at 40°F or lower. Keep uncooked meats separate from vegetables. Wash your hands, knives and cutting boards after they have touched uncooked foods.  Thoroughly cook leftover foods and ready-to-eat foods such as hot dogs until they are steaming hot. Stay away from foods from delis such as prepared salads, meats or cheeses, or heat these foods until steaming before eating. Finally, keep in mind that pasteurizing food will kill    Listeria . But pasteurized foods can still be contaminated with the bacteria if they are exposed to unclean surfaces or equipment.

        "content": "By: James A. Wilde, MD, FAAP Methicillin-resistant Staph aureus (MRSA) is a staph bacteria that is resistant to certain antibiotics and is one of the leading causes of skin infections in the U.S., both in children and in adults.   While MRSA was once limited to hospitals and nursing homes, over the past 15 years it has spread all over the world―into the community in schools, households, and child care centers, among other places. \t According to some surveys, up to 30% of children in U.S. classrooms have MRSA on their skin or in their noses.  A child's first line of defense against MRSA is a well-informed parent. Read on. Here are frequently asked questions about this \"super bug\" from other parents like you: How do children get MRSA? MRSA spreads with skin-to-skin contact, or by touching objects or surfaces that are contaminated with the bacteria. Once it spreads to a child, they can either become a carrier for the bacteria or develop an active         infection .  \t Most children who are carriers for MRSA don't develop any symptoms of infection. The bacteria simply live on their skin or in their noses . But they may pick at their noses, for example, and spread the bacteria to toys they play with. Older children who play sports can also spread MRSA bacteria through shared equipment.\t For an active MRSA infection to take hold, there must be an opening in the skin or in the nose for the bacteria to get into the body . This can come from minor cuts and minor scrapes, scratching at a bug bite, conditions like         eczema , or even         body piercings . Once the skin is open, even a tiny amount, MRSA bacteria can get in and start to multiply.  What are the signs and symptoms of a MRSA infection? It usually starts as a bump or infected area on the skin that appears red or swollen, has pus, is warm to the touch, or just looks infected. If you or someone in your family experiences these signs and symptoms, cover the area with a bandage and contact your doctor. It is especially important to call your doctor when these signs and symptoms are accompanied by a fever.         View photos of MRSA skin infections here .   The most common skin infections caused by MRSA include         abscesses, boils and cellulitis . They often are mistaken for spider bites, or may resemble a pimple, blister or rash. In rare cases, MRSA can also lead to more serious infections inside the body like         pneumonia , bone infections,         sepsis , and         meningitis . If my child was exposed to MRSA what should I do? If your child is exposed to another person with MRSA infection, the chances he or she will develop an infection is very low. If you notice any concerning symptoms mentioned above, call your pediatrician. Tips to Avoid a Bad MRSA Infection―At Any Age: Always use good                       handwashing habits. Cover open or draining sores or boils with a clean, dry bandage. Avoid sharing personal items, such as towels, razors, or clothing. Frequently wash or clean shared toys, dress-up clothing, and other play equipment. Routinely clean surfaces that have frequent contact with skin (chairs, toilet seats, doorknobs, keyboards, phones, etc.)  Make sure athletic equipment and locker rooms are regularly cleaned and disinfected, focusing on frequently touches surfaces such as wrestling mats, exercise equipment, benches. Shower right after practice, and wash uniforms after each use.\t How is MRSA different from other Staph infections? Here is a little background on that: Staphylococcus aureus or         \"staph\" infections  used to be easy to kill with penicillin. In the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s,         things changed ; the bacteria adapted and penicillin wasn't able to treat the infection. Scientists created new forms of penicillin, including methicillin, to counter the problem.  For many years, methicillin and other engineered forms of penicillin effectively treated for Staph aureus infections. But because healthcare providers         prescribed antibiotics too often , Staph aureus was able to change again around the year 2000 and become resistant to methicillin. The name given to this new germ―MRSA. Can MRSA be treated? Yes. When treated early, MRSA skin infections usually get better. Although penicillin and methicillin no longer work to kill MRSA, there are other antibiotics that do work and can be used in children. And sometimes antibiotics aren't needed at all. Treatment options include: If the collection of pus is an inch or two in diameter, your doctor can make a small cut or incision in the skin and squeeze the pus out. Nature usually handles the rest without antibiotics. Children infected with boils, abscesses, or cellulitis can have a culture taken by their doctor to determine the best antibiotic choice. If the abscess is very small, sometimes antibiotics can treat the infection without the need for an incision.  Very large abscesses, especially if there is also fever, need to be drained. Then the doctor prescribes one of the antibiotics that kills MRSA. This can sometimes be done as an outpatient procedure at the hospital, but young children often require a short admission to the hospital. Why do hospital staff and visitors have to wear gloves and gowns in the room of someone with MRSA?    Gowns and gloves are worn in the hospital to prevent the spread of MRSA to other patients; sick people are at higher risk of infection from MRSA. To avoid the infection from spreading once your child is home from the hospital, make sure to cover your child's sore (if present) with clean, dry dressings or bandages as directed by your doctor. Any used bandages and dressings can be thrown into the regular trash. If these items are soaked with wound drainage or other body fluids, place in a plastic bag and seal, then throw into regular trash. Be sure to wash your hands well with soap and water or alcohol gel after handling these items. Can I visit someone in the hospital with MRSA while I'm pregnant? Although more research is needed on MRSA and pregnancy, there is currently no evidence that that Staphylococcus aureus exposure increases complications like miscarriages or birth defects. In fact, one         study  found babies born to mothers who carried MRSA on their skin rarely became sick from the bacteria. Pregnancy does weaken your immune system some, however, so it is important to be extra careful when you are near someone with an active infection. If you visit someone in the hospital when you are pregnant, always wash your hands afterward and wear a mask and gloves. It's a good idea to wash your clothes in the hottest temperature water recommended once you get home, too. If you do get a MRSA infection during pregnancy, it can be treated.  Is it safe for a grandmother with MRSA living in her nose to hold her grandchildren? Yes. The risk of transmitting MRSA to them is small. It is possible to spread MRSA by touching your nose and then touching someone else. Washing your hands with soap and water or alcohol gel after touching your nose and before touching others will help to prevent the spread of MRSA to others. Should my child stay home from school if she has MRSA?  Those who only carry MRSA in the nose or on their skin but who do not have signs or symptoms of infection are able to go to school and other activities. Those with active MRSA skin infections may also be at school IF: The infection can be covered with a bandage or dressing. All wound drainage can be contained throughout the day without having to change the dressing or bandage at work or school. The infected person is willing and able to follow good hand and personal hygiene. Until skin infections are healed, children with MRSA skin infections should not use whirlpools or swimming pools or participate in contact sports or other physical activity in which bandages or dressings may fall off.  If someone gets MRSA, will they always have it?  Maybe. Many people who have active infections are treated and no longer have MRSA. However, sometimes MRSA goes away after treatment and comes back several times. If MRSA infections keep coming back again and again, your doctor can give you advice on how to stop these repeat infections or spread of the infection to other family members. Even if active infections go away, you can still have MRSA bacteria on your skin and in your nose. This means you are now a carrier of MRSA. You may not get sick or have any more skin infections, but you can spread MRSA to others. It is not fully understood why some people are carriers of MRSA, yet don't get infections. Remember:  If your child has MRSA, teach him or her what it means to have a contagious infection. Make a plan with your child care provider to reduce the risk of spreading MRSA to other children. If your child is in school, make a plan with the school nurse.

        "content": "Occasional news about mad cow disease has caused concern among some parents about buying meat. However, the chance of getting mad cow disease appears to be much smaller than parents may think.\t Mad cow disease is the commonly used name for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). It is one of a number of prion diseases. Prions are a type of infectious particle. Prion diseases are progressive, degenerative infections that affect the central nervous system of cattle. They can be spread to humans who eat the beef of an infected animal or come into contact with tissues of infected animals. The cattle themselves become infected with BSE by eating feed contaminated with the BSE organism. The cattle develop brain disease that results in death. When humans get the disease, it causes a variation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) called variant CJD (vCJD), which is a fatal brain disorder.\t Millions of cattle have been destroyed in Europe since the first cases of mad cow disease appeared in the 1980s. The first BSE case in a dairy cow in the United States was identified by the Department of Agriculture in December 2003. The Food and Drug Administration and other federal agencies have regulations in place to prevent contamination of the US food supply with BSE. At present, the risk of getting BSE from beef available in the United States is considered extremely low.\t Worldwide, BSE-related illnesses remain very rare in humans. Through December 2003, there were a total of 143 cases of vCJD reported in the United Kingdom, plus 6 cases in France and 1 each in the United States, Canada, Italy, and Ireland. A person can also become infected if he receives a transplant from someone with the disease or a child receives a growth hormone that was made from the pituitary gland of an infected person. Note that growth hormones are now manufactured rather than taken from human bodies.\t Signs and Symptoms\t People with mad cow disease can have very serious signs and symptoms, including personality changes, muscle stiffness, involuntary muscle movements, dementia, and seizures. The disease can affect individuals at a younger age than those with traditional CJD (a median age of 28 years in vCJD, compared with 68 years in classic CJD). Most cases have occurred in adults, but an occasional case has been seen in teenagers. The traditional form of the disease has a hereditary basis. Both diseases involve abnormal proteins that accumulate in the brain.\t How Is the Diagnosis Made?\t The signs and symptoms of vCJD will help your pediatrician make the diagnosis. However, the only way to definitively diagnose any human prion disease is to examine the brain tissue itself.\t Treatment\t No treatment is available to slow down or stop the progression of mad cow disease or other prion infections. Studies are currently taking place to investigate a number of experimental treatments.\t What Is the Prognosis?\t Mad cow disease is fatal. The incubation period for disease related to exposure to infected tissues varies between 1.5 years and more than 30 years.\t Prevention\t There is no evidence that cooking contaminated meat will destroy the BSE organism. Government regulations of the beef industry make the risk of transmission of BSE to people very unlikely.",

        "content": "Infectious mononucleosis is sometimes called mono or the kissing disease. It is caused most often by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is in the herpesvirus family of organisms. Most people become infected with EBV at some point in their lives. Like all herpesviruses, EBV stays within the body once a person is infected. Most of the time, the virus is in an inactive (latent) state, but occasionally the virus multiplies and is shed in saliva and other body fluids.\t Getting the Facts About Infectious Diseases\t Epstein-Barr virus is spread from one person to another in saliva, blood, and other body fluids. Close contact is usually required, such as kissing or sexual contact.\t Although the infection can occur at any age, mononucleosis is most common in people between 15 and 30 years of age.\t Signs and Symptoms\t Many infants and young children infected with EBV have no symptoms or only very mild ones. When there are signs and symptoms of mononucleosis, they usually include the following:\t Fever\t Sore throat, including white patches in the back of the throat\t Swollen lymph glands in the back of the neck, groin, and armpit\t Fatigue\t In addition to these classic symptoms, some children may also have one or more of the following signs and symptoms:\t Chills\t Headache\t Decreased appetite\t Puffy eyelids\t Enlargement of the liver and spleen\t Oversensitivity to light\t Anemia\t Some children with EBV infection develop meningitis, brain inflammation (encephalitis), and a paralyzing disorder called Guillain-Barré syndrome. Occasionally, EBV can cause myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), an abnormal decline in the number of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia), and inflammation of the testes (orchitis).\t This virus can cause several types of cancer. In Africa, EBV causes Burkitt lymphoma; in Asia, nasopharyngeal cancer; and in the United States, a type of lymphoma. However, cancer caused by EBV is rare. It is not clear why some people infected with the virus get cancer while the vast majority does not. In patients with organ transplants, EBV can cause a malignant disorder called lymphoproliferative disease.\t There is a rare genetic disease, seen mostly in boys, in which the body cannot control the EBV infection. This serious infection may lead to liver failure, decreases in the blood cells, or cancer and is often fatal. The incubation period of infectious mononucleosis ranges from 30 to 50 days.\t When to Call Your Pediatrician\t Contact your pediatrician if your child has the major symptoms described here, especially a fever, sore throat, fatigue, and enlarged glands.\t How Is the Diagnosis Made?\t The diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis is usually made through a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests. These tests may include a complete blood count to check for unusual looking white blood cells (atypical lymphocytes). Blood tests can also detect increases in antibodies against EBV.\t Treatment\t Much of the treatment for mononucleosis is aimed at making your child more comfortable until the infection goes away on its own. For example\t Some pediatricians may recommend giving your youngster acetaminophen to reduce the fever and ease pain.\t Sore throats can be treated by gargling with warm water and salt.\t Bed rest can be important for a child feeling fatigued. \t Because a virus causes mononucleosis, infected children should not be treated with antibacterials. \t In a small percentage of EBV-infected children, corticosteroids such as prednisone are given, but only if certain complications are present, such as inflamed tonsils that may block the breathing passages.\t Children with infectious mononucleosis should not participate in contact sports until the swelling of their spleens subsides. If the body is hit in the area of an enlarged spleen, the spleen can rupture or tear open, causing internal bleeding that can lead to death. Keep in mind that this is uncommon and that mononucleosis rarely results in death.\t What Is the Prognosis?\t Most cases of infectious mononucleosis clear up in 1 to 3 weeks (although symptoms, particularly fatigue, can last for several additional weeks in some children). Patients with abnormal immune systems can have a more severe infection that further weakens the immune system, resulting in cancers or death caused by liver failure and bacterial infections.\t Prevention\t It is difficult to prevent the spread of this virus because people who have been infected can spread the virus for the rest of their lives. Your youngster should avoid infected saliva by not sharing drinking glasses, water bottles, or eating utensils.\t No vaccine is available to protect against infectious mononucleosis.\t Prevention Tip\t When to share and when not to share? Your child should not share drinking glasses, water bottles, or eating utensils, which can carry infected saliva.",

        "content": "​​​​​​​​​You may have heard frightening reports about      Naegleria fowleri , commonly called the \"brain-eating amoeba.\" In one recent case, for example, a child was infected with the parasite after swimming in a ​ Nebraska river .  ​Fortunately, infections from      Naegleria fowleri  are rare. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that only      31 infections​  were reported in the United States between 2012 and 2021.  Still, as a parent, you want to do everything you can to protect your child. Here's what to know about      Naegleria fowleri  and how you can prevent infection.  What is      Naegleria fowleri ?\t Naegleria fowleri  is an amoeba that's commonly found in warm fresh water and moist soil. It loves heat, so it's most often found in water during the summer. But      Naegleria fowleri  often lives in the sediment at the bottom of freshwater bodies in much cooler temperatures too. \t Naegleria fowleri  can also grow in hot water heaters, pipes and water systems. This includes systems that are treated for public drinking. It hasn't been found in salt water.  How can      Naegleria fowleri  infect people?\t Naegleria fowleri  infections can happen after water containing the amoeba gets into your nose. It can then travel up the nasal cavity to the brain. There, it ​can cause an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). A PAM infection is almost always deadly because it kills brain tissue quickly. Out of 154 known infections in the United States from 1962 to 2021, only four people have survived. You can only be infected with  Naegleria fowleri  through your nose. That means you can't get an infection from  drinking water  that contains  Naegleria fowleri . The infection cannot be spread from person to person either. When do most      Naegleria fowleri  infections happen? PAM infections from  Naegleria fowleri  typically occur in the summer. They mostly happen to kids and young adults, especially boys 14 years old and younger. The majority of infections with  Naegleria fowleri  develop after swimming in lakes, ponds or hot springs.They usually involve diving, swimming or putting your head under water in warm fresh water. It's rare, but you can also be infected at swimming pools, surf parks and splash pads that don't have enough chlorine. Infections with  Naegleria fowleri  can happen after using contaminated tap water to rinse your sinuses or nose. How can I protect against  Naegleria fowleri  infection?  Prevention To prevent      Naegleria fowleri  infection, you can:  Avoid  swimming and diving in warm freshwater places , especially in the summer. This includes lakes, ponds, rivers and hot springs.  Boil tap water for 1 minute and letting it cool before            rinsing your sinuses​  using neti pots, bulb syringes, squeeze bottles and other nasal irrigation devices. Or use distilled, sterile or filtered water.  Reducing the risk Whenever you're in fresh water, there's a risk of infection. You can lower your family's risk by following these guidelines: Don't dive or jump in. Diving and jumping in makes it more likely for water to go up your nose. When swimming, use nose clips or pinch your nose shut. Even better, don't put your head underwater at all. Keep your head out of hot springs and other bodies of untreated geothermal water. Don't dig into or stir up the sediment at the bottom of shallow bodies of warm fresh water.            Naegleria fowleri  is most likely to live here.  What are the symptoms of primary amebic meningoencephalitis? The early symptoms of PAM usually start around 5 days after infection. But they can start anywhere from 1 to 12 days afterward.  Early symptoms of PAM may include:  Fever Headache Nausea Vomiting Changes in smell and taste  Later symptoms of PAM can include:  Stiff neck Fatigue Confusion Changes in personality Hallucinations Seizures Coma  Death usually happens around 5 days after symptoms start. However, it can occur within 1 to 18 days afterward.  Are there treatments for Naegleria fowleri infections? Experts are still trying to find the best medicines to treat PAM. It's hard to know what works well because PAM is so rare, and it develops so fast. This is why it's important to start treatment right away if PAM is even suspected.  Right now, PAM is treated with a combination of medications including:  Amphotericin B Azithromycin Fluconazole Rifampin Miltefosine Dexamethasone            What should I do if I think my child has a      Naegleria fowleri  infection? Keep in mind that      Naegleria fowleri  infections are extremely rare. What may seem like PAM symptoms are more likely from an illness that's more common, such as bacterial meningitis. That said, if your child has recently been in fresh water and suddenly has symptoms such as fever, headache, stiff neck or vomiting, get medical help right away.      Has climate change affected      Naegleria fowleri ?\t Naegleria fowleri  can exist in any body of freshwater, anywhere in the United States. This is especially true during the months of July, August and September. Most infections from      Naegleria fowleri  have been in southern states. But since 2010, cases have been found in more northern states such as Nebraska, Minnesota and Indiana. This may be partly due to      climate change .

A related species of  M tuberculosis,  which doctors call non-TB mycobacteria (NTM), can cause other illnesses in children and adults.\t Although there are many species of NTM (more than 80, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), the most common in childhood are  M avium, M intracellulare,  and  M fortuitum.  Many of these species are found in soil, food, and water. They enter the body through cuts in the skin, via the gums during teething, or through the respiratory tract during normal breathing. Even though many children are exposed to these germs, only a few ever develop a chronic infection or disease.\t In youngsters, the most common NTM infection is called cervical lymphadenitis, an inflammation of the lymph nodes in the neck. Other infections occur much less commonly, including bone inflammation (osteomyelitis), ear infections, lung disease, and skin infections.\t These NTM illnesses sometimes occur in children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections.

        "content": "I nfectious diseases are illnesses caused by germs (microbes). It is important to realize that not all germs (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) cause disease. In fact, a host of bacteria normally live on the skin, eyelids, nose, and mouth and in the gut. These bacteria are called  normal flora  and are considered normal inhabitants. These normal flora are helpful to us! The bacteria in our bowels break down foods and form vitamin K, an essential vitamin for all of us. The normal bacteria on our skin and in our mouths protect us by preventing or decreasing the chance that we will become infected with harmful bacteria and fungi.       \t The normal balance of bacteria can be upset by antibiotics and some illnesses. Viral infections often damage body surfaces and set the stage for infection by harmful bacteria.\t Frequently, bacteria are present on a body surface such as the nose or throat or in the bowels, but there is no illness. This is called  carriage  of the bacteria, and the person with the bacteria is called a c arrier.  There is no illness in the carrier, but the carrier sometimes can transmit or spread the bacteria to another person. Many of the bacteria that are carried can cause infection and illness.\t It is not always clear why the same strains of bacteria cause carriage in one child, mild illness in another, and serious infection in others. Sometimes it is because of factors in the child or the bacteria, but often doctors don’t understand the reasons.\t Some important factors in the child include age, immunity, nutrition, genetic makeup, and general health. Newborns are at risk because their protective systems are not yet tested and are not always mature. Infants are at risk because they tend to put everything into their mouths and rarely clean their hands. Older children are less at risk because their hygiene is better and they have become immune through prior infection or carriage of bacteria.\t Another important factor for a child is the use of medical devices such as catheters (tubes placed in blood vessels or into the bladder) and other tubes (e.g., from the nose to the stomach, from the nose to the lungs). These catheters and tubes provide a direct path for bacteria and fungi to get into the blood, bladder, or lungs. Medicines such as corticosteroids (used in asthma and many other conditions) and cancer chemotherapy can interfere with a child’s ability to fight infection. Even antibacterials can be a factor by killing the normal protective flora.\t Factors in bacteria, viruses, and fungi include genes that determine how harmful (virulent) the microbe can be. Some germs make toxins that cause illness by themselves or contribute to infections caused by the germ. Examples include enterotoxins, which cause diarrhea; tetanus toxin, which causes lock jaw; and toxic shock toxin, which leads to low blood pressure and collapse (shock).\t Infections are a normal part of childhood. Most children will have at least 6 to 8 respiratory (breathing tract) infections each year. These include colds, ear infections, sinus infections, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Infections of the bowels also are common.\t When children gather together in child care settings and school, there is the opportunity for infections to spread from one child to another. \t Not all infections are contagious (able to spread from person to person). Ear and bladder infections are not spread from child to child, while diarrhea and colds are easily spread.\t The  incubation period  is the time it takes after a child is infected until he becomes ill. Sometimes the incubation is short (e.g., a day or so for the flu), while other times it is quite long (eg, 2 weeks for chickenpox and many years for human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]). In some cases, a person is contagious during the incubation period, while in others the person is not contagious until the illness begins. The amount of time a child remains contagious depends on the infection and the child. Young children are often contagious for longer than older children.\t Infections are sometimes so mild that there are few or no symptoms. Other infections cause more severe illness. Infections cause harm by damaging a person’s body parts (cells and organs) and causing inflammation. Inflammation is one way a child protects himself from infection. Inflammation usually destroys the infecting agent. Unfortunately, inflammation can be harmful to the child as well. Inflammation can harm organs, cause pain, and interfere with normal body functions.\t Many infections come and go with no harm to the child. Others cause pain and, sometimes, death. Some infections resolve, but leave a child with organ damage. While many germs come and go, some germs stay with your child even after the illness resolves. For example, herpesviruses (herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, varicella, and human herpesvirus 6 and 7) remain in your child for a lifetime. If your child gets chickenpox, that virus stays inside his nerve cells after the rash and illness go away. The virus can reappear later in life as shingles (herpes zoster).  \t Germs and Children: Terminology normal flora\t Bacteria that live on or in a child\t pathogen\t A germ that can cause a disease\t colonization\t Presence of a germ in or on you without disease.\t infection\t A germ causing an illness.

        "content": "By: Robert W. Frenck, Jr., MD, FAAP\t Salmonella  bacteria cause more than a million infections each year in the United States. Most often, people get sick after eating food contaminated with    Salmonella . Their symptoms usually include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps.    Salmonella  illness can sometimes be severe enough to require a hospital stay. Here's what families need to know about    Salmonella , how to recognize symptoms of infection and how to prevent it.\t Learn about recent Salmonella outbreaks here. Who is most at risk from    Salmonella? Infections occur most often in infants and children younger than 4 years because their immune systems are still developing. Babies who are not breastfed are also more likely to get sick from   \t Salmonella . Infants may be exposed to    Salmonella  if they eat contaminated food or come into contact with contaminated surfaces or sick family members. Elderly people and those whose immune systems are weakened from certain medical conditions (such as diabetes, liver or kidney disease and cancer) or treatments also are at increased risk. How does    Salmonella  spread?\t Salmonella  bacteria usually spread to humans by animal products such as poultry, beef, fish, eggs and    dairy products . At times, though, other foods such as fruits, vegetables and bakery products have caused outbreaks. Most often, this happens when these foods were contaminated by contact with an animal product. The bacteria can also be spread by drinking    contaminated water . Salmonella outbreaks have been linked to infected    pets  such as    backyard poultry , snakes,    small turtles , lizards and other reptiles. And, it can spread by contact with contaminated pet food. Typhoid fever, which is also caused by    Salmonella , is only spread through contact with an infected person or an item contaminated by an infected person.\t Salmonella  outbreaks Eggs  As of Sept. 6, 2024, 65 people have been infected with Salmonella linked to eggs. At least 24 people have been hospitalized. All sizes, types and expiration dates of \"Milo's Poultry Farms\" and \"Tony's Fresh Market\" eggs are recalled. Throw away the recalled eggs or return them to the store where they were purchased. ( More information here .) Small turtles As of Aug. 16, 2024, 51 people—including 17 children under age 5 years—have been infected with    Salmonella  linked to small turtles. Small turtles with shells less than 4 inches long are    illegal to sell  in the U.S. because of repeated illnesses and outbreaks. Despite the ban, some online retailers, pet stores and roadside markets continue to sell them. Turtles of any size are    not recommended  as pets for children younger than age 5 years. Kids can get sick from touching reptiles or anything in their environment and then touching their mouth or food. ( More information here .) Backyard poultry  As of Aug. 29, 2024, 409 people in 45 states have been infected with    Salmonella  linked to contact with backyard poultry. Backyard poultry can carry    Salmonella  germs even if they look healthy and clean. Always wash hands after touching backyard poultry, their eggs or anything where they live or roam.    ( More information here .) Signs & symptoms of    Salmonella  infection\t Salmonella  bacteria are best known for being a cause of    diarrhea . This type of illness, called gastroenteritis, typically happens after eating food that has been contaminated with    Salmonella . When your child has a    Salmonella  infection that causes gastroenteritis, they may have symptoms such as: Diarrhea Abdominal cramps and tenderness Fever While the overwhelming number of people with    Salmonella  infection have gastroenteritis, the bacteria also can cause a variety of other disorders, including: Bacteria in the blood (bacteremia) Inflammation of the membranes of the brain or spinal cord ( meningitis ) Inflammation of the bone (osteomyelitis) Any recent travel? Although very rare in the United States, travelers to India, Latin American, Africa and parts of the Asia may become infected with a strain of    Salmonella  called typhoid. This is a long-lasting febrile illness which if untreated can be fatal in up to 30% of cases. So, if you return from travel and have an unexplained fever, it is important to let your doctor know about your recent travels. What to know about typhoid fever Typhoid fever develops gradually. Its signs and symptoms may include fever, headache, loss of appetite, lethargy, abdominal pain, changes in mental status, an enlarged spleen and constipation or diarrhea. The incubation period for gastroenteritis ranges from 6 to 48 hours, while typhoid fever has a longer incubation period of 3 to 60 days. When to call your pediatrician Contact your pediatrician if your child shows no improvement within 2 to 3 days of symptoms appearing or if they have blood in their stools or shows signs of dehydration (such as an absence of tears when crying, a decline in urination). How is    Salmonella  diagnosed? Your pediatrician can test for    Salmonella  organisms from cultures of stool, blood, or urine that are examined in the laboratory. Treatment for    Salmonella  infections If your child only has    Salmonella -associated diarrhea, the treatment is supportive (fluids and rest). Antibiotics are not prescribed as they do not make your child get better faster and actually may increase the length of time your child has    Salmonella  in the stool. An exception is infants under 3 months of age, because they have an increased risk of the infection spreading from the intestine to the blood and other organs in the body. However, when the infection is found in the blood, brain, bone or other organs, antibiotics are needed. A child with severe diarrhea may get very dehydrated and need intravenous (IV) fluids or extra fluids given by mouth. How long does a    Salmonella  infection last? Most    Salmonella  gastrointestinal infections last for 4 to 7 days and clear up on their own without treatment. How to prevent    Salmonella  infection\t Salmonella  infections can often be prevented by practicing good hygiene techniques during food preparation, as well as regular    hand washing . Be sure to thoroughly cook eggs, poultry and ground beef. Hands should always be washed after playing with pets, especially lizards and pet turtles.\t If your child has a problem with their immune system:  Avoid reptiles used as pets, such as lizards and snakes. Children with    sickle cell anemia  are at risk for    Salmonella  infection of the bones. Families of these children should avoid having reptiles and amphibians as pets.\t If you plan travel to an area where typhoid exists:   Make an appointment with your doctor (preferably 1-2 months before travel) to discuss vaccination against the infection.

        "content": "​By: Sylvia Owusu-Ansah MD, MPH, FAAP Anyone can get an infection, and almost any infection can lead to sepsis—the body's extreme response to an infection. Without timely treatment, sepsis  (sometimes called septicaemia or septicemia)  can rapidly lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.  Sepsis can affect anyone at any time, but it does tend to strike the very old and the very young. Children, particularly newborns and young infants, can be more susceptible to developing sepsis. Those with underlying health problems are also at a higher risk.  Each year in the U.S., more than 75,000 infants and children develop severe sepsis .  Almost 7,000 of these children die—more deaths than children who die from cancer.  Be Alert to the Signs & Symptoms of Sepsis: Detecting sepsis early and starting immediate treatment is often the difference between life and death. Parents and caregivers must seek immediate medical care if they suspect their child has an infection that is not improving or is getting worse. Sepsis may have been preceded by an infection such as a urinary tract infection, pneumonia, or a skin or bone infection.  The signs and symptoms of sepsis can include a combination of any of the following:  Fever or low temperature (newborns and infants may have low temperature) Fast heart rate  Fast breathing Feeling cold/cold hands and feet  Clammy and pale skin Confusion, dizziness or disorientation Shortness of breath Extreme pain or discomfort Nausea and vomiting Important Note:  Many of these signs and symptoms  alone  are common in babies and children when they are sick. Most of the time, they do not have sepsis. However, when more than one of these signs and symptoms happen together, or when a baby or child just seems sicker than usual—you should seek medical help. If your baby or child's skin is cold, pale, or has developed strange colors or markings; if your baby or child has become unresponsive or is struggling to breathe; or if your baby has dry diapers for more than 12 hours—you should take him or her to the emergency room without delay. How Is Sepsis Treated? Sepsis, or even suspected cases of sepsis, are treated in the hospital. Often, babies and children will need care in an intensive care unit (ICU).  Fighting the infection is an emergency.  Doctors and nurses will give IV antibiotics to fight the infection. Many other things may be needed to fight sepsis—IV fluids, special heart and/or blood pressure medications, and medications to keep children calm and comfortable. In some cases, children may need a ventilator to help with breathing.   You might hear the term \"sepsis work-up.\"  \"Sepsis work-up\" refers to the combination of tests used to diagnose the specific cause of a child's infection. It is important to figure out what type of virus or bacteria is causing the infection. The sepsis work-up may include testing blood, urine, and spinal fluid; an x-ray or an ultrasound test may also be included.  Neonatal Sepsis: When a child develops sepsis within a few months of birth (up to 90 days), it is called  neonatal sepsis . If the sepsis develops within the first hours or days after birth, it is called  early onset   sepsis . Sepsis that develops after the baby is 1 week old is called  late-onset neonatal sepsis .  Premature infants develop sepsis more often than infants who are born on time.   Sepsis in Older Children: As children get older, their exposure to illness can increase as they attend child care, go to school, and participate in activities, such as sports. Children, like adults, can develop bacterial infections such as   urinary tract infections , skin infections,  pneumonia ,  appendicitis , and  meningitis . Left untreated, these can all lead to sepsis. What to Expect in the Hospital:  Most sepsis patients are admitted to the hospital. Babies and children who are extremely sick may be cared for in the hospital ICU.   Babies and children will need to have IV's placed to give fluid and medications.  They will have needle sticks for blood tests. Depending on their age, a soft tube or a needle might be needed to get urine for testing. To test spinal fluid, the baby or child may also need a spinal tap. This involves placing a hollow needle in the back to take a small sample of spinal fluid—the fluid that surrounds the spinal cord and brain. Testing the spinal fluid is important to determine the baby or child has meningitis. On occasion, surgery may be required for those who have surgical infections leading to sepsis such as a severe skin or bone infection or appendicitis. Parents and Caregivers Can Help Stop This Medical Emergency in Its Tracks. Talk with your pediatrician about steps you can take to prevent infections. Some steps include taking good care of  chronic health conditions  and following  recommended vaccination schedule s. Practice good hygiene, such as  handwashing , and keeping  cuts  clean until healed.  Know the signs and symptoms of sepsis.   ACT FAST. Get medical care IMMEDIATELY if you suspect your child has sepsis or an infection that's not getting better or is getting worse.

Staphylococcus aureus  also causes toxin-related illnesses, including toxic shock syndrome, scalded skin syndrome, and staphylococcal-related food poisoning. In fact, staphylococcal bacteria are the leading cause of food poisoning. \t Some of the childhood infections associated with  Staphylococcus  that you should be familiar with include the following:\t   Cellulitis is a bacterial skin infection that first affects the outer layers of the skin and then may spread more deeply into body tissues under the skin. Although other types of bacteria can cause cellulitis,  Saureus  is responsible for many childhood cases. Symptoms include redness, swelling, warmth, and tenderness of the skin. Your pediatrician may diagnose the infection by examining the area. The doctor may take a culture of the skin or wound, and blood tests may be ordered to identify the organism involved. Antibiotics taken by mouth are usually prescribed for mild cellulitis. Some severe cases require hospitalization with intravenous antibiotics.With proper treatment, most cases clear up in 7 to 10 days.\t Impetigo is a common and contagious skin infection in young children, developing most often during hot, humid summers and usually appearing on the face around the nose, mouth, and ears. It can be caused by staphylococcal or streptococcal bacteria. (More often, it is caused by a staphylococcal infection.) Staphylococcal organisms sometimes can cause blisters. Your pediatrician may diagnose the infection by taking a sample of the material from within the blister and having it tested in the laboratory. Antibiotics should be prescribed for this condition and are usually taken by mouth. In mild cases, an antibiotic cream or ointment can be applied to the skin. Until the rash heals or for at least the first 2 days of antibiotic treatment, your child should avoid close contact with other children.\t Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a disease that affects infants and young children. It tends to begin with a single staphylococcal skin infection, often in a baby’s diaper area, in which bacteria produce a toxin that reddens and damages the skin. Large sections of the top layer of skin (epidermis) can be peeled or slipped away just by pressing down lightly or rubbing the affected area, exposing a raw and red layer that is vulnerable to other infectious organisms. These children can also run a fever. Your pediatrician may put your child on intravenous antibiotics. Warm compresses can be placed on the skin to ease any discomfort. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome usually heals without scarring.",

The most prevalent enterococci species are  Enterococcus faecalis  and  Enterococcus faecium.\t If your child is sick and your pediatrician suspects a streptococcal or enterococci infection, the doctor will take samples of body fluids to test and identify any organisms that may be present. For most streptococcal infections, your child will be treated with penicillin. Because enterococcal infections are often resistant to penicillin, other drugs may be chosen.

        "content": "​​​By: Scott Pangonis, MD, MS, FAAP & S. Elizabeth Williams, MD, MPH, FAAP​\t Candida  is a type of yeast, part of the fungus family that normally lives in and on our bodies. It can be found on the skin and in the mouth, for example, and in the intestinal tract and genital area. Most of the time,      Candida  does not cause any problems. However, when it overgrows, it can cause infections such as candidiasis. These fungal infections can become chronic.  What is thrush? Candidiasis infection of the mouth, also called oral      thrush​ , is common in infants and toddlers. Thrush can also affect fingernails, eyes, and skin folds of the neck and armpits, as well as the diaper area, including the vagina and folds of the groin.  How do infants and children get thrush and other      Candida  infections?​\t Pregnancy & birth.  Newborns can get a      Candida  infection from their mothers. This can happen while they're still in the uterus, but also during passage through the vagina during birth. Most of these infections are caused by  Candida albicans , although other species of      Candida  are becoming more common.\t Medicine.  Sometimes, children develop candidiasis after taking      antibiotics . While antibiotics fight germs that make a child sick, they sometimes also affect the “good\" bacteria that help keep the body's balance of microbes in check. This gives fungi like      Candida  a chance to overgrow. Using inhaled      steroids  for asthma without rinsing the mouth with water afterward inhaler use can also lead to candidiasis. \t Health conditions.  In some children with serious health challenges, the fungus may enter the bloodstream. Those most risk of bloodstream infections with      Candida  include      premature  or very low birthweight infants, children with long-term intravenous (IV) catheters, and children with weakened immune systems caused by      cancers​  or medicines. For these children, oral nystatin and fluconazole are often used to prevent candidiasis. If      Candida  infections become chronic or occur in the mouth of older children, it may be a sign of an immune system challenge, such as human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection.      Candida  infections of the skin, mouth (thrush), or vagina in children over 2-3 years of age, can also be a sign of      diabetes . How to help prevent                  Candida  infections​ ​ Here are some ways to help reduce the risk of candidiasis in children:\t \t  Change diapers frequently.  Keep your child's diaper area as clean and dry as possible.​\t Use antibiotics only when necessary.  Since fungal infections (thrush or vaginitis) often follow courses of antibiotics, it is important to use them only as prescribed by your doctor.\t Follow directions for asthma medicines.  If your child has                           asthma , make sure they rinse their mouths with water after using inhaled steroids for the treatment.\t Keep diabetes in good control.  Be sure you are                           managing  it well to reduce candidiasis risk.     Signs & symptoms of      Candida  infections \t Infants.  In infants, symptoms include painful white or yellow patches on the tongue, lips, gums, palate (roof of mouth), and inner cheeks (thrush). It can also spread into the esophagus, making it painful to swallow. Candidiasis can make a      diaper rash  worse, producing redness and sensitivity in the affected area, along with a raised red border in some cases. \t Teens.  Teenage girls who develop a vaginal      yeast infection  may have symptoms such as itching, pain, redness, and/or a thick, “cheesy\" vaginal discharge. A yeast infection often follows antibiotic therapy.\t Children taking IV medications.  Symptoms are different for children who get      Candida  infections while receiving      chemotherapy​  treatment, or other long-term home medications delivered through an IV catheter. In these cases, the fungus gets into the blood system. Once in the blood, the yeast can travel throughout the body, causing infection of the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, eyes, brain, and skin. The early signs of a      Candida  bloodstream infection are fever and blockage of the IV catheter. ​How is a      Candida  infection diagnosed? Your pediatrician will often make the diagnosis by examining your child and reviewing symptoms. Scrapings of      Candida  lesions (sores) inside the mouth or other spots can be further examined for signs of the infection. An ultrasound or CT scan can detect candidal lesions that have developed in the brain, kidney, heart, liver, or spleen after a bloodstream infection. Cultures of the blood or mouth lesions are sometimes taken to grow the fungus in the laboratory and identify the type and sensitivity of the yeast. Treatment for      Candida  infections Antifungal drugs are used to treat candidiasis. The antibiotic nystatin is often prescribed for children with infections such as oral thrush or a      Candida -related diaper rash, for example. The specific medicines given for candidiasis vary, depending on the part of the body where the infection is concentrated. If candidiasis has spread through the bloodstream, your pediatrician will usually recommend treatment with an IV medicine. Some of these IV medicines cause uncomfortable side effects, but are still reliable medicine for serious, invasive fungal infections. However, most medications used to treat candidiasis are well tolerated by most children. ​How long does it take for      Candida  infections go away? Once treatment starts, most candidiasis infections get better within about 2 weeks. It is not uncommon for infections to return, however. Long-lasting thrush is sometimes related to pacifiers or      bottles  that have not been properly boiled to remove the fungus. The infection is much more difficult to treat in children with catheters or weakened immune systems. Typically, the catheter must be removed or replaced to effectively treat infections that are from with these devices. Tests are also usually done to see if the infection has spread to other parts of the body. Antifungal therapy can take weeks to months for the more challenging infections. Remember Talk with your pediatrician if you think your child may have symptoms of      Candida  infection, or whenever you have any questions about your child's health.

        "content": "Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a potentially deadly illness that is caused by toxins (poisons) made by 2 types of bacteria,  Staphylococcus aureus  and  Streptococcus pyogenes  (GAS). It was first recognized in 1978 in children and adults. The vast majority of early cases were associated with  S aureus  in menstruating teenaged girls and young women who used highly absorbent vaginal tampons.\t Although the use of tampons (particularly extended use) can still increase the chance of getting TSS, there are now fewer cases associated with tampons. Other risk factors have been identified, including recent use of barrier birth control methods (eg, diaphragm, vaginal sponge), surgical procedures, recently giving birth to a baby, and a current infection with bacteria such as  S aureus.  When TSS occurs in young children, it is sometimes present at the same time as a varicella infection (the virus that causes chickenpox).\t Signs and Symptoms\t The signs and symptoms of TSS develop rapidly, often beginning with a high fever (at least 102°F or 38.9°C) that sometimes includes chills.\t Other signs and symptoms can vary, depending on the type of bacteria involved. They may include\t   Red skin rash that looks like sunburn\t Red eyes (conjunctivitis)\t Watery diarrhea\t Vomiting\t Severe muscle aches\t Confusion\t Low blood pressure\t A week or more after the beginning of the skin rash, the skin around the nails may begin to peel. Then, as the infection progresses, the skin around the soles of the feet and palms of the hands also begins to peel.\t Toxic shock syndrome can affect many organs in the body, including the lungs, bowel, brain, and kidneys. Complications are caused by a decline in blood pressure (hypotension) as well as the direct action of the toxin, which makes organs of the body more likely to fail, leading to the need for respirators and dialysis. Some people die from TSS, but the overall mortality rate is less than 5%. The risk of death is higher in adults than children and depends on which organs in the body are involved.\t When to Call Your Pediatrician\t Toxic shock syndrome is a serious condition that requires a doctor’s prompt attention. If your child has these symptoms, contact your pediatrician immediately.\t How Is the Diagnosis Made?\t Your doctor will evaluate your child’s signs and symptoms. The pediatrician will order blood tests and cultures to look for the effects of the toxin and presence of the bacteria  (S aureus  and  S pyogenes)  responsible for TSS.\t Treatment\t If your child develops TSS, she will need to be hospitalized. She will be treated with antibacterials such as nafcillin, penicillin, or clindamycin for at least 10 to 14 days.\t Supportive treatment, such as giving intravenous fluids and stabilizing blood pressure with medicines, will be necessary. Kidney dialysis may be required in cases of kidney failure and ventilators (respirators) are used for failure of the lungs.\t Intravenous immune globulin treatment may be given to get rid of bacterial toxins in the bloodstream and help speed up recovery.\t Prevention\t If your teenaged daughter uses tampons, she should choose them with care. Tampon manufacturers have changed the way they make their products to decrease their absorbency, and this has significantly lowered the number of TSS cases associated with tampon use. Make sure your daughter uses tampons with low absorbency and changes them often.",

        "content": "Learning disabilities are traditionally diagnosed by conducting two tests and noticing a significant discrepancy between their scores. These tests are an in­telligence (or IQ) test and a standardized achievement (reading, writing, arith­metic) test. Most children found to have a learning disability have normal or above-normal intelligence but do not fully demonstrate that potential on achievement tests. For example, a youngster might score 112 on the full-scale IQ test, but her math score might be 90; this discrepancy of 22 points between her potential ability (IQ) and actual achievement (in math) might qualify her for special services at her school. Some states, for example, define a learning disability as a difference of 15 points, but the criteria for services vary from one part of the country to another. As a result, state-mandated definitions sometimes exclude a range of learning difficulties that do not produce wide discrepancies.\t When a learning disability is not detected early, diagnosed correctly, and treated effectively, it can cause a number of other problems. These additional difficulties may be emotional, and a child can show signs of sadness, frustra­tion, or disappointment. Behavior problems like acting out might occur. Or the learning problems may show up within the family, causing, for example, mis­understandings, increased stress, or blaming others. Studies show that among children whose families seek professional help for emotional or behavioral problems, 30 to 50 percent of them have learning disabilities.",

        "content": "By: Ryan E. Gill, MD, FAAP & Mary Leppert, MB, BCH, FAAP Over 2 million students in the United States have    learning disabilities and differences . There are many strategies and tools that can be used at home and at school to support them. Let's go through some of the most common ones to better understand how to help our children learn.  Dyslexia Dyslexia is a difficulty with the way the brain processes written and spoken language. It mostly affects reading and may be referred to as a \"reading disorder.\" However, it can also affect writing, spelling and speaking. In addition, dyslexia can impact social skills, listening comprehension, time management memory and navigation or sense of direction. The exact cause of dyslexia has not been identified. We do know that differences in genetics, the anatomy of the brain, and the activity between language-processing centers in the brain play a role in this learning disorder. Dyslexia is a lifelong condition that a child will not outgrow. A common misbelief about dyslexia is that it's a    vision problem , but that's not the case. Rather, the brain of children who have dyslexia reverses or inverts the information it receives from the eyes. It is also important to know that dyslexia    is not  a result of laziness or lack of intelligence. How to support a child with dyslexia There are many ways to help a child with dyslexia thrive. Providing specific instruction on how to identify individual sounds in language can help them match these sounds with letters, for example. Reading programs with a multisensory approach—using all the senses to learn—are also beneficial. There is   \t no evidence  that vision therapies or eye exercises treat dyslexia or other learning disabilities. \t School accommodations  that may help kids with dyslexia include: one-on-one small or small-group instruction extra time for reading and writing simplified directions audiobooks or books on tape shortened assignments access to teacher's notes to reduce the need for note-taking  At home, you can help your child by    reading out loud  with them. When you read aloud, your child can hear stories above their reading level. You can also listen to audiobooks with them and recite nursery rhymes or memorable songs with younger children.  Dysgraphia\t Dysgraphia  is difficulty with the physical act of writing. It can affect handwriting or typing on a keyboard. Dysgraphia is not a disorder of expressing oneself (see more about that, below). However, it causes children to focus a great deal on physically transcribing words. This, in turn, can affect how they think about and convey ideas. Dysgraphia can be a result of dyslexia,    motor skill  (movement) coordination or problems understanding space (spatial awareness). Having dysgraphia   \t does not  mean that a student is lazy or that they lack intelligence.\t   How to support a child with dysgraphia Occupational therapy helps children improve fine motor skills and planning. It's the main way that children with dysgraphia get help. School accommodations, strategies and tools may be helpful for kids with dysgraphia include: Extra time for writing tasks Responding in ways other than writing (such as orally) Breaking writing tasks into smaller steps  Taking breaks before proofreading their work Checklists for editing work (spelling, neatness, grammar) Graphic organizers like charts and diagrams Tools like pencil grips and talk-to-text programs At home, good ways to support a child with dysgraphia include practicing keyboarding skills or trying a handwriting program. You can try working with them on letter formation in a new and fun way, such as writing in the air, in shaving cream or in sand! Disorder of written expression  Written expression is a complex process. It requires the ability to use language with other skills at the same time. This includes attention, organization, planning and movement coordination.  Dysgraphia, which involves the mechanical skills of writing, is only half the story when it comes to writing challenges. Sometimes a child has difficulty using the language or concepts involved to express themselves in writing. This is called disorder of written expression. The condition may also be referred to as a written language disorder.  Disorders of written expression can co-occur with other learning disabilities, along with neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ). It is estimated that about 60% of children with ADHD meet criteria for written language disorder by 19 years old. That's compared with about 12% of those without ADHD. How to support a child with disorder of written expression School accommodations and other strategies for students with disorders of written expression may include: Extended time on tests and assignments Very clear instructions Word banks\t Mnemonics  (memory tricks)  Pre-writing exercises such as brainstorming, creating mind maps or other visual organizers Assistive technologies such as grammar and spelling checkers and talk-to-text programs Dyscalculia Dyscalculia is a learning disability in math. It may involve difficulty with understanding quantities, concepts such as bigger or smaller, and math symbols. Students may also have difficulty applying concepts that they do understand in order to solve math problems. Dyscalculia is not as well-understood as other learning disorders like dyslexia. We do know that dyscalculia occurs at similar rates across genders. (We also know it's a myth that boys are better at math than girls.)  How to support a child with dyscalculia There are no specialized teaching programs for dyscalculia like there are for dyslexia. However, multisensory lessons may help students with dyscalculia to learn math. School accommodations that can help kids with dyscalculia may include: extra time for math tests fewer math problems to solve on assignments calculator use At home, children can use objects like cereal pieces to solve simple math problems. Playing board games and computer games can also provide fun math practice. Evaluating your child's learning challenges & strengths It is often helpful to have a full learning disorder evaluation done through school or privately. This evaluation can help to better understand your child's specific learning difficulties, as well as their strengths. It can also provide recommendations for school accommodations and supports in the home and community that would be most helpful to your child's specific needs.  Helping your child keep a growth mindset Having difficulties in school can be a blow to a student's confidence. It may make them feel \"dumb\" or embarrassed. It is important to remind your child that we all struggle with something. Help them to focus on a \"growth mindset,\" remembering that their skills improve with time and support. Most importantly, families help their child to build    self-esteem  and confidence.

        "content": "By: Jennifer Zubler, MD, FAAP Children learn many skills in life—how to listen and speak, for example, or how to read, write, and do math. Some skills may be harder to learn than others. If your child has had appropriate learning experiences and instruction, but is not able to keep up with peers, it's important to find out why and how to help.  Children who learn and think differently can succeed in school, work, and relationships. Often, they can benefit from help that uses their strengths and targets any areas of need. What is a learning disability (LD)? Learning disability is a term used to describe a range of learning and thinking differences. These differences can affect the way the brain takes in, uses, stores, and sends out information.  Some children have specific learning disabilities (also known as LDs), such as reading or math disabilities. Others may have conditions that affect learning like attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) or    hearing loss . Many children with learning differences and difficulties can have more than one learning disability or condition that affects learning. What causes learning difficulties? There are many reasons why a child may have difficulties learning. The causes aren't always known, but in many cases children have a parent or relative with the same or similar learning and thinking differences and difficulties. Other risk factors include low birth weight and  prematurity , or an injury or illness during childhood (for example, head injury,  lead  poisoning or a childhood illness like  meningitis ). \t  \t   Regardless of the cause of learning difficulties, the first step is to recognize your child is struggling and to discuss your concerns with your child's teachers and doctor. Together, you can find out what is contributing to the difficulties and make sure your child gets any    help  needed. How do I know if my child has learning differences and difficulties? Learning and thinking differences aren't always obvious, but there are some signs that could mean your child needs help. Keep in mind that children develop and learn at different rates. Talk with your child's teacher and let your child's doctor know if your child shows any of the following signs:\t   How We Found Answers & Support \t \t  By Jon Morin As a baby and toddler, my son Benjamin met or exceeded every developmental milestone on the list. He was stacking dozens of blocks by the time he should have been able to stack several. He talked very early and was reading at some level by 2 years old. I was thrilled to have such a bright, happy, active kid.      Still, there was something different about this child. He seemed to never stop moving—his body or his brain. He was alert and aware all the time, never napped, and hardly ever slept for more than a few hours at a time. He wasn't fussy, but he just seemed to be on 24-7. Once Benjamin was in preschool, his differences became more apparent. He was more active than the other kids—always bouncing in his chair or walking about the room. When he was concentrating hard or excited, he would flap his arms and legs. He was very sensitive to textures and sounds. Benjamin seemed anxious, too. I didn't know what it all meant, but I knew it wasn't the norm. My wife was worried, too. As a former early intervention specialist, she knows a lot about child development. But even with all that knowledge in our household, we still didn't know what was going on. So we talked it over and decided I would take him in to see the pediatrician. I wasn't sure about the appointment. I didn't know what to ask, and I didn't know if the pediatrician would know what to do with my concerns. So instead of asking questions, I just described what seemed different to me: his constant motion, his anxiety and his sensitivities; his repeated questions and activities, and how he would line up his toy cars into rows and talk about them just as much as playing with them. Our pediatrician listened intently and asked some questions. When I was done describing, right away he knew what our next step should be: He referred us to a  developmental-behavioral pediatrician  who specializes in neurology. I was relieved to have a clear course of action. The developmental-behavioral pediatrician did the appropriate assessments and ultimately gave my son his diagnoses of ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. I had mixed emotions when Benjamin got the diagnoses. But I was so grateful to our pediatrician for helping us get answers. Benjamin now gets the support and services he needs to thrive. He really is a happy and fun kid, and he doesn't consider having ADHD or autism labels. They are just part of his identity. Thanks to the help of the pediatrician, our family is set up for success. Not all children with learning differences will need to see a specialist or have the same diagnosis as our son. I encourage you to talk with your pediatrician to help figure out what is best for your child. \t Jon Morin is a contributing blogger for Understood.org, which encourages parents to \t   Take N.O.T.E.\t \t  Notice  if anything is out of the ordinary. \t \t  Observe  behaviors to determine patterns. \t \t  Talk  to a teacher, social worker or caregiver to validate. \t \t  Engage  with trusted professionals, like pediatricians.   Preschool children may have: Delays in    language development . By 2½ years of age, your preschool-age child should be able to talk in phrases or short sentences. Trouble with speech. By 3 years of age, your child should speak well enough so that adults can understand most of what they say. Trouble learning colors, shapes, letters and numbers. Trouble rhyming words. Trouble with coordination. By 5 years of age, your child should be able to button clothing, use scissors, and hop. They should be able to copy a circle, square, or triangle. Short attention spans. Between 3 to 5 years of age, your child should be able to sit still and listen to a short story. As your child gets older, they should be able to pay attention for a longer time. Frustration or anger when trying to learn.\t School-aged children and teens may find it difficult to: Follow directions. Get and stay organized at home and school. Understand verbal directions. Learn facts and remember information. Read, spell or sound out words. Write clearly (may have poor handwriting). Do math calculations or word problems. Focus on and finish schoolwork. Explain information clearly with speech or in writing. Is there a cure for learning disabilities? There is not necessarily a \"cure\" for learning disabilities. However, there are many ways to help children and families manage them in a way that helps children learn and thrive in life.  Be wary of people and groups who claim to have simple answers or solutions. You may hear about eye exercises, body movements, special diets, vitamins, and nutritional supplements. There's no good evidence that these work. If in doubt, talk with your child's doctor. Also, you can contact trusted resources like the ones listed at the bottom of this page for more information. Who can help? Talk with your child's doctor and teachers about any learning struggles you    notice . Pediatricians can evaluate developmental delays and other    conditions that may contribute  to learning difficulties. They can also refer you to specialists in neurodevelopmental disabilities, developmental and behavioral pediatrics, child neurology or child psychology, for example.  Teachers and other education specialists perform screening or evaluation tests to identify problems and determine if early interventions or school-based supports can help. Most school evaluation teams include psychologists and learning specialists. 4 ways parents can help children who learn and think differently In addition to working with your child's teachers and doctors, you can help support your child with learning disabilities and difficulties. For example:\t Focus on strengths.  All children have things they do well and things that are difficult for them. Find your child's strengths and help them learn to use them. Your child might be good at math, music or sports. They could be skilled at art, working with tools or caring for animals. Be sure to praise your child often when they do well or succeeds at a task.\t Develop social and emotional skills.  Learning differences combined with the challenges of growing up can make your child sad, angry or withdrawn. Help your child by providing love and support while acknowledging that learning is hard because their brain learns in a different way. Try to find clubs, teams, and other activities that focus on friendship and fun. These activities should also build confidence. And remember, competition isn't just about winning.\t Use resources & support groups  to help you learn more about parenting a child with learning difficulties. Learning and thinking differences are common. You and your child are not alone in this journey.\t Plan for the future.  Many parents whose child learns and thinks differently worry about the future. Help your child plan for adulthood by encouraging them to consider their strengths and interests in education and career choices. Remind them that learning differently isn't tied to how smart they are. In fact, many people with learning difficulties are very bright and grow up to be highly successful at what they do.  Special career and work programs can help build confidence by teaching decision-making and job skills. Many colleges have programs to support students who learn and think differently successfully earn a degree. Remember Children who learn and think differently can thrive with the right support. The sooner you know what's going on with your child, the sooner you can get your child help. Talk with your child's teachers and doctor if you have any concerns about your child's learning.

        "content": "A minimal evaluation includes a psychological assessment of cognitive func­tion (an IQ test) and an educational assessment of academic achievement (a standardized test). Other testing might evaluate so-called neurodevelopmental functions (such as language, memory, attention, and motor skills), the emo­tional status of your child, and a social assessment (family and environment).   This evaluation process can be complicated, time-consuming, and difficult for parents and child to understand. Sometimes it is quite expensive if you obtain the evaluations outside the school system. In most cases, you should start with the full evaluation provided by your child's school. If it cannot be done within a reasonable time or if specialized testing is needed, request payment from the school system before you get a private evaluation. However, regardless of where they are done, these evaluations can be both informative and productive.\t Because the entire evaluation process may be complex and involve many people, a case manager or services coordinator (like a pediatrician, psycholo­gist, or learning-disability educator) may be helpful. The coordinator can also assist you in planning appropriate interventions or treatments, making refer­rals, monitoring the effect of treatment upon your child, and arranging for follow-up evaluations. Frequently this takes a team effort.\t Once an evaluation is completed, schools usually arrange a meeting to fully discuss the findings and your child's educational plan. This meeting might be attended by your youngster's teacher(s), guidance counselor, the special-education teacher, the principal, the school psychologist, and nurse. Some­times children attend the meeting. Occasionally you may want to ask your pediatrician to attend to provide support for you and your perspective. If you wish, bring someone with you who might serve as the child's advocate and who is familiar with these evaluations and meetings and understands the im­plications of the findings and interventions. Make sure the results are ex­plained to you in terms you can understand.\t In explaining the learning problem to your child, avoid simplistic, negative labels such as  learning disabled, handicapped,  and  hyperactive;  instead, help him look at himself in a comprehensive and positive manner that acknowl­edges weaknesses but also emphasizes strengths and special attributes.\t Children with learning disabilities generally respond well to a sensitive and appropriate evaluation and treatment plan. This is particularly true if this plan is supportive, removes blame from both child and parent, focuses on the pres­ent problems, attends to other associated concerns, allows the youngster to achieve at a higher level than before, and results in his feeling more confident, self-reliant, and motivated. It can be helpful to point out successful adults who also have learning disabilities.",

        "content": "What is a  learning disability ? Even the experts can’t always agree. An important definition is found in the American Psychiatry Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the main reference book physicians rely on to help them diagnose these conditions. The most recent edition, the DSM IV, identifies three types of learning disabilities:  dyslexia , the inability to read, spell and write words, but not as a result of faulty eyesight; dysgraphia, the inability to write properly; and dyscalculia, the inability to perform mathematical calculations.\t Definition of \"Learning Disabilities\" \t The federal government takes a broader view. Under the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) , all eligible children between the ages of three and twenty-one are guaranteed free and appropriate special education and related services in the public schools. IDEA defines “learning disabilities” as follows:\t A disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or written, which may manifest itself in an imperfect ability to think, speak, read, write, spell, or to do mathematical calculations. The term includes such conditions as perceptual handicaps, brain injury, minimal brain dysfunctions, dyslexia, and developmental aphasia.\t That encompasses not only the trio of disorders mentioned above, but also  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  and pervasive developmental disorders, including  autism  and Asperger’s syndrome. Although the law expressly does not include intellectual disabilities, states and individual school districts are free to modify the guidelines. Some do classify an intellectual disability as a learning disability; others may provide special-education services for students whose academic achievement falls well short of their potential, as measured by test scores.\t To add to the confusion, you may hear the same learning problem referred to as a learning disability, a developmental disability or yet another term. Ultimately, how these disorders are classified isn’t as important as recognizing that each one can seriously interfere with a youngster’s ability to learn.\t All learning impairments share one thing in common: deviations in processing in one or more locations of the brain. Several studies employing sophisticated brain-imaging technology have been able to observe the workings of brains with learning problems. At Yale University School of Medicine, for example, patients with dyslexia were asked to read while they underwent a magnetic resonance imaging scan. The researchers clearly observed a difference in the parts of the brain that normally handle reading.\t Similarly, imaging studies of people with ADHD have found decreased functioning in the areas that enable us to concentrate; and scans of people with autism reveal abnormalities in brain structure, particularly within the shellshaped cerebellum nestled at the base of the brain. Impaired brain development from a variety of causes is also at the root of an intellectual disability. (These imaging procedures were employed strictly for research purposes, incidentally; they are not part of a routine diagnostic workup.) Learning difficulties are diagnosed in at least four times as many boys as girls. This may be due in part to the fact that boys who have problems academically are more prone to disruptive behavior and to resisting reading and other challenging tasks in school. Therefore they tend to be referred more to specialists and subsequently diagnosed.\t Many of these disorders may weave their way through family trees. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, children with ADHD usually have at least one close relative who also has the disorder. Frequently it’s the father; at least one in three who have ADHD themselves pass it on genetically to their offspring.\t Typically, a learning deficit becomes apparent early in childhood, though not always. If the problems are subtle, a child may compensate sufficiently for quite a while; in fact, some of these boys and girls happen to be extremely bright. It’s only after the work in school becomes more complex, beginning around third or fourth grade, that they start to struggle. “This is the time when the curriculum begins to shift from ‘learning to read,’ to ‘reading to learn,’ ” explains Dr. Mark L. Wolraich, a specialist in learning disabilities. Of the more than 2.4 million children with learning disorders in U.S. schools, about four in five encounter problems with reading and language.\t Several of these conditions have overlapping features; consequently, misdiagnoses are not uncommon. For instance: Difficulty concentrating in school characterizes ADHD, but is also a hallmark of Asperger’s syndrome, intellectual disabilities or  depression . Furthermore, learning difficulties are typically accompanied by secondary problems.\t Let’s return to the example of ADHD. Some of these children are additionally diagnosed with another learning problem, such as dyslexia. A number develop the behavioral disorder oppositional defiant disorder. Their belligerence and fits of temper can be attributed partly to their lack of success in school and other circumstances. “But some of the misconduct,” says Dr. Wolraich, “is due to the fact that the two conditions tend to occur together.” Less commonly, adolescents or young adults with an attention deficit have or will develop  bipolar disorder , a serious mood disturbance also referred to as manic depression. \t Learning Problem? It's That and More\t Rarely are the effects of a learning problem confined solely to the classroom. They frequently spill over to other areas of daily life. Making friends can be especially difficult for many of these youngsters, some of whom lack fundamental social skills, such as the ability to understand nuances of language and read facial expressions. A joke that sends others into hysterics may sail right by them. Of course, many boys and girls with learning difficulties get along splendidly with their peers, but for those who are socially awkward,  adolescence  can be a painful time. Adolescents with learning problems can be screened by their pediatrician or other health professional for other difficulties, such as  anxiety  or depression.\t A child’s diagnosis thrusts parents into the role of advocate: the person(s) charged with getting her whatever educational, psychological and rehabilitative services she needs. Mothers and fathers are also advocates in the sense of providing constant love and encouragement. Keeping  self-esteem  aloft and promoting a positive self-image vie in importance with helping a child with a learning problem academically. In short, be your child’s number-one fan. Remember: No one will love and support him or her more than you.\t If you suspect your teenager might have a learning problem of some kind, consult his pediatrician, who can outline a plan of action. Don’t deny your instincts, as parents sometimes do, largely out of fear that a finding of ADHD, or autism or another problem will permanently stigmatize him.\t Stigmatize him? With whom? Between increased public awareness and 120,000 new cases of learning disorders among students every year, a learning problem no longer carries the stigma it once did. But, frankly, what other people might think shouldn’t even cross a parent’s mind. When mothers and fathers ignore the reality of the situation, in a well-intentioned but misguided attempt to protect their child, they are depriving him of the help he needs in learning to live with his disorder. Until then, his schoolwork is likely to suffer, reinforcing a destructive pattern of failure. And without therapy to show him ways to control any alienating behaviors, the more likely it is that he will suffer the rejection of his peers.\t Approximately two in five boys and girls with ADHD aren’t diagnosed until they reach junior high or high school—sometimes not until  college . Imagine what it must be like to spend years not understanding why you can’t seem to do better in school. How many teens conclude it must be because they’re “stupid”? Or “lazy,” a frequent accusation. To receive an explanation for why learning has always been hard usually comes as a relief. Although it is preferable for learning problems to be picked up early in childhood, know it is never too late to help a youngster turn things around.\t Initials, Initials, and More Initials\t  \t ADHD \t attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder\t AS\t Asperger’s syndrome  \t ASD\t autism spectrum disorder  \t CAPD\t central auditory  processing disorder\t DD\t developmental disabilities  \t HFA\t high-functioning autism  \t LD\t learning disability  \t ID\t intellectual disability \t OCD\t obsessive-compulsive  disorder  \t PDD\t pervasive developmental  disorder  \t PDD-NOS\t pervasive  developmental disorder  not otherwise specified  \t SI\t speech impairment",

        "content": "Reading is a cornerstone of learning. However, it's not always easy for all kids to read. About 10 million children in the United States have some sort of reading disorder. People with reading disorders can face challenges when their brain processes written words and text differently. Writing and math can also be challenging for children with reading disorders.  Usually, reading disorders develop at a young age, although a  brain injury  can cause a reading disorder at any age. There are also certain medical conditions that can be underlying causes, such as speech and  hearing  problems.  Keep in mind that children develop at different rates and spend varying amounts of time at each stage. In case your child's reading level is lower than  what's expected for their age , check with your child's doctor. Children who are having trouble reading benefit from early intervention. Your child's doctor may suggest strategies to help your child or refer them to a reading specialist. The big 5 of reading skills The process of reading is complex and consists of many components. A good reader needs to develop 5 skills as they begin their reading journey: phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency and comprehension. \t Phonemic awareness  is the ability to identify and use individual sounds in spoken words. Phonemic awareness helps students learn the language better and improves their reading abilities.  In    phonics , a child learns the relationship between the letters of written language and the individual sounds of spoken language. Phonics is an essential skill that children use to read and spell and recognize words instantly. \t Vocabulary  is a child's stored and growing collection of words they use in conversations and in reading. \t Fluency  is the ability to read text accurately, quickly, and with good expression.  A child having good    comprehension  skills can understand, remember, and make sense of what they read. Children who have problems with one or more of these components can find reading difficult. A child with a reading disorder usually has more trouble understanding and recognizing what they read. Common reading disorders in children Hyperlexia and dyslexia are well-known types of reading disabilities.   Hyperlexia A child with hyperlexia has a very high ability to read before they turn 5 years old and is fascinated by the written material, including letters and numbers. They have strong visual and auditory memories and can recall what they see and hear without too much effort.  However, despite their high reading skills, they have low reading comprehension. It is common for them to repeat phrases or sentences without comprehending the meaning. Children with hyperlexia are unable to use their language skills effectively. They have difficulty with who, what, why, where, and how questions. They also have difficulties speaking and communicating with kids their age.  Hyperlexia is often, but not always, associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). About 84% of children with hyperlexia are on the autism spectrum. It is estimated that only 6% to 14% of children with ASD have hyperlexia.  Types & symptoms of hyperlexia There are 3 types of hyperlexia.\t Hyperlexia type 1:  Children with hyperlexia type 1 learn to read early and far above their expected level without developing any disabilities. \t Hyperlexia type 2:  Children with ASD have hyperlexia type 2. These children show more signs of ASD, such as avoiding eye contact, avoiding affection, having sensitivity to sensory input, and obsessing over letters and numbers. \t Hyperlexia type 3:  Children with hyperlexia type 3 have remarkable reading comprehension but lack verbal language development. They are outgoing, make eye contact, and show affection. Hyperlexic type 3 symptoms gradually disappear with time. Hyperlexia diagnosis & treatment There is no specific test to diagnose hyperlexia. Children with hyperlexia typically show symptoms and changes over time in their behavior. It is possible for a child with this disorder to also have another disorder, such as    Autism Spectrum disorder , language disorder or social communication disorder.    Early intervention increases a child's chances of learning language and social skills. Discuss developmental issues with your child's doctor to diagnose hyperlexia.  A child with hyperlexia type 1 does not need any treatment. Early-age intervention is beneficial for children with hyperlexia types 2 and 3. Children with hyperlexia can benefit from speech, language, and occupational therapy.  Dyslexia Dyslexia impairs a person's reading ability and can affect both children and adults. Kids with dyslexia may have difficulty decoding words, matching letters to sounds, and recognizing words and spelling. Having dyslexia does not reflect a person's intelligence. As many as 1 in 5 children in the United States have dyslexia.  Symptoms of dyslexia Dyslexia symptoms and severity can vary with age. Symptoms of dyslexia often appear before a child begins school. A young child may have speech delay, difficulty processing language, or trouble following directions. They have difficulty putting things in order and pronouncing new words and avoid reading activities. It may take them a while to process and summarize what they read.  Such children are prone to having difficulties memorizing and figuring out left from right. When reading, they may use reverse letters/sounds, such as \"d\" and \"b\" or \"p\" and \"q,\" and may have a speech delay.  Dyslexia diagnosis & treatment Dyslexia is usually diagnosed in childhood, but it can remain undiagnosed until adulthood. As a result of dyslexia, kids have difficulty reading, writing, spelling and speaking clearly. Dyslexia is genetic and often runs in families.  It is not possible to diagnose dyslexia with a single test. Evaluations typically involve identification, screening, testing, and gathering information about the child's history and issues. Professionals then assess a child's specific needs and determine how best to assist the child. There are no medications that treat dyslexia. Early educational intervention can help a child learn effective ways to learn and read. Research shows that phonics instruction that involves letters and sound associations can significantly enhance the reading ability of children with dyslexia.  How to help your child with reading difficulties It's important to act early if you notice problems with spoken language, rhyming, pronouncing, or finding words, especially if there is a family history.  Early intervention is essential because effective instruction boosts a child's learning abilities and prevent  anxiety, depression  and low self-esteem.  Reading the same book over and over again helps children who have dyslexia. As a result, they learn how to focus on one word at a time and develop a natural reading rhythm.  Reading aloud helps children who have dyslexia decode unfamiliar words and build fluency and confidence. Another excellent alternative to reading is listening to audiobooks.  Remember Don't hesitate to talk with your child's teachers and pediatrician if you have any concerns about your child's reading development so they can get the right support to help them thrive.

Adolescents understand that how you do in school matters, but try not to make their value as a person be based on how they do in school.\t Advocate for the right environment for  your child’s learning style .  A school where sitting still and being quiet is the rule, with no hands-on learning, may not be right for your adolescent.\t Make sure to focus on what your adolescent is good at  because if they are not doing well in school (where they spend most of their time), they are likely feeling bad about themselves. Even though it may seem that they don’t, adolescents thrive on adult approval and need to feel that they are valued.\t Words like “lazy” and “stupid” should not be part of your or your adolescent’s vocabulary.  Poor performance and a bad attitude are symptoms of a  learning difference , not its cause. When adolescents understand why they are having trouble in school and how they can get help in the areas they need support, they can believe again in their potential for success.\t Know when to strengthen and when to avoid a weakness.  If an adolescent has  dysgraphia  (poor handwriting) and his school requires written exams, then it may help to get him  occupational therapy  to improve his hand-eye coordination. If his school allows him to take notes on a laptop and he types well, encourage him to do so. Sometimes a combination of approaches is the way to go.\t Praise the process instead of the outcome.   Praising  a young person for his effort  (“I can tell you really thought that through.”)  rather than the outcome  (“You are good at math!”)  can lead to more confidence.\t Help kids use their strengths to find confidence and to help compensate for their weaknesses.  Figuring out an adolescent’s talent can help to drive her sense of self-worth.\t Understand the  dangers of perfectionism .  Expecting perfection can only lead to eventual disappointment. Learning to put up with mistakes and even failure helps adolescents deal with the realities of the world, where things don’t always turn out as planned, even if we try really hard.\t Use the right  interventions  for the right reasons.  The goal of interventions should not be to change grades, but to support healthy growth and development.",

        "content": "Eating disorders are conditions that occur in people who experience a difficult relationship with food. They may face extreme guilt with eating, a fear of weight gain and an unrealistic body image. These thoughts can disrupt and take over their daily lives. Here what parents need to know about 2 eating disorders: anorexia nervosa (commonly known as anorexia) and bulimia nervosa (commonly known as bulimia). Some people show signs and symptoms of both eating disorders. What is anorexia? Anorexia is an eating disorder that results in unhealthy weight loss. People with anorexia may have a distorted body image, and they restrict their calories and/or purge to reach unrealistic weight goals.  Calorie restriction often involves increasingly narrow food choices, smaller portion sizes and skipped meals. Guilt about eating can lead to purging through exercise, vomiting or medications such as laxatives. Malnutrition can develop, with potential harm to typical growth and development. Who can develop anorexia? Although anorexia is more common in females, anyone can develop anorexia. People from all genders, races, ethnicities, ages and social and economic backgrounds can develop anorexia. People who develop anorexia frequently start with a reasonable goal of wanting to live a healthier lifestyle. However, at some point, obsessive thoughts about dieting, exercising, and losing weight take over. These lead to unhealthy behaviors and excessive weight loss.  The eating disorder may cause the child to become secretive about their eating and restriction. The development of an eating disorder can be subtle and often goes unrecognized by doctors and parents. What types of behaviors may be signs of anorexia? People with anorexia control their weight. They may Eat only a small number of \"safe\" foods, usually low in calories and fat Avoid eating food on their plate by moving it around or cutting it up into tiny pieces Not eat food they cook for others Do things to keep their mind off their hunger, such as chewing gum or drinking large amounts of water Exercise in excess Your child may also Wear baggy clothes to hide their body Spend more time alone and away from friends and family Tire more quickly Seem depressed or anxious Be more emotional, or quick to cry or get angry How does anorexia affect the body? Over time, anorexia can affect the entire body because of malnutrition. Most noticeably, it affects the heart, brain, bones and digestive and reproductive systems. When the body is starved of food, physical and mental changes may happen. Physical changes with anorexia Always feeling cold because the body has lost the fat it needs to keep warm.\t Dizziness, fainting , or near fainting. More noticeable bones because of a loss of normal fat layers and muscle. Hair loss. Brittle hair and fingernails. Dry and rough skin. Affected menstrual periods. If anorexia develops before a girl's first period, periods may not start. For girls developing anorexia later, periods may stop. Stomach pain, constipation and bloating. Stunted growth that could be permanent. Anemia (low count of red blood cells) causing tiredness, weakness and dizziness. Mental changes with anorexia Feeling depressed, anxious or irritable Decreased concentration Increased difficulty completing tasks, such as schoolwork Anorexia results in the highest rate of death among people with mental illness. Death can be by    suicide  or can be caused by malnutrition (the body is not getting enough nutrients). What is bulimia? Bulimia is an eating disorder in which a person eats large amounts of food (binges) and then tries to undo the effects of the binge in some way. Usually, the person rids (purges) the food that was eaten. What is bingeing and purging? During a binge, people with bulimia eat large amounts of food, often in a fairly short time. Binges usually end when there is no more food to eat, the person's stomach hurts from eating, or a distraction interrupts the binge. Binges are usually emotionally distressing because the person often feels as if they can't stop and have lost control. After bingeing, people with bulimia typically feel guilty and are afraid of gaining weight. To ease their guilt and fear, they purge the food from their body by vomiting or other means. They may also turn to extreme exercise or strict dieting. This period of \"control\" lasts until the next binge. Then the cycle starts again. Is bulimia the same as binge-eating disorder? Note: People with binge-eating disorder eat large amounts of food in a short time and feel intense guilt afterward, but unlike people with bulimia, they don't purge following a binge. Who can develop bulimia? Although most people with bulimia are teenaged girls and young adult women, anyone can develop bulimia. People from all genders, races, ethnicities, ages, and social and economic backgrounds can develop bulimia. People with bulimia aren't happy with their body. Then, in response to anxiety and other emotions, they give in to their impulses and cravings for food by bingeing. People with bulimia may have underweight (slightly), overweight, or average weight. What types of behavior are signs of bulimia? People with bulimia have difficultly controlling their eating behavior. They may Become very secretive about binge eating. Spend a lot of time thinking about and planning the next binge. For example, they may Set aside certain times to binge and purge Avoid social activities to binge and purge Steal food or hide it in different places, such as under their bed or in closets Exercise or use laxatives to \"purge\" their body of food consumed People with bulimia often face other problems as well, such as Depression and thoughts of suicide Substance use How does bulimia affect the body? Bulimia harms a person's physical and mental health. For example, Teeth start to decay from contact with stomach acids during vomiting. Weight goes up and down. Menstrual periods may become irregular or stop. The face and throat may look puffy and swollen. Dizziness and fainting may occur. Dehydration caused by loss of body fluids occurs. Upset stomach, constipation, and sore throat. Damage to vital organs such as the liver and kidneys; heart problems. Death. What causes eating disorders? There is no known cause for eating disorders. However, there are factors that may play a role. These include a family history of mood disorder or eating disorder, environmental factors, and certain personality traits. How are eating disorders treated? The earlier an eating disorder is recognized, the higher the chance of recovery. Treatment depends on many things. These include the person's willingness to make changes, family support, and the stage of the eating disorder. Successful treatment of eating disorders involves a team approach. The team includes many health care professionals working together. Each one treats a certain aspect of the disorder.  Treatment should begin with a visit to a pediatrician who will assess how the eating disorder has affected the body. If the effects are severe, the person may need to be hospitalized. Treatment of the eating disorder will not be successful if good nutrition and physical health are not restored first. Medical treatment In treating anorexia, the team helps a person get back to a healthy body weight. This return to weight is crucial for successful recovery. If a person refuses to eat, they may need to be admitted to a hospital for nutrition. In treating bulimia, the team may admit a person to a hospital to treat medical complications, such as dehydration or electrolyte imbalance, or to stop the cycle of bingeing and purging. Counseling & family therapy Living with an eating disorder is difficult on children, teens, and their families. Both emotional and physical health are affected. Without help, a person with an eating disorder can have serious health problems and even die. However, with treatment, a person can get well and go on to lead a healthy life.\t Counseling  is an important part of treatment and helps a person with an eating disorder Manage their unhealthy thoughts Understand how they use food as a way to deal with problems and feelings Improve their self-image and develop the confidence to take control of their life\t Family therapy  helps family members understand the problem and guides families to use effective approaches for recovery.\t Nutrition counseling  with a registered dietitian can help patients and families return to healthy eating habits. Why early treatment is important The earlier an eating disorder is recognized, the better the chance of recovery. If you are a parent who has noticed that your child's eating patterns have changed, talk with your child's doctor. Do not wait for your child to agree that they have a problem. Teens with eating disorders often do not recognize this change for themselves. If you are a teen and need help, it's important that you talk with your parent or your doctor as soon as possible.

        "content": "As with disruptive behavior disorders, there is a great deal of overlap between anxiety disorders and ADHD. About one fourth of children with ADHD also have an anxiety disorder. Likewise, about one fourth of children with anxiety disorders have ADHD.  This includes all types of anxiety disorders—generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation anxiety, and phobia (including social anxiety). Younger children with overanxious disorder or separation anxiety are especially likely to also have ADHD. \t Anxiety disorders are often more difficult to recognize than disruptive behavior disorders because the former’s symptoms are internalized —that is, they often exist within the mind of the child rather than in such outward behavior as verbal outbursts or pushing others to be first in line.  An anxious child may be experiencing guilt, fear, or even irritability and yet escape notice by a parent, teacher, or pediatrician. Only when her symptoms  are expressed in actual behavior, such as weight loss, sleeplessness, or refusal to attend school, will she attract the attention she needs.  It is important to ask your child’s pediatrician or psychologist to talk with your child directly if you suspect the presence of persistent anxiety in addition to her ADHD.  \t What to Look For \t Identifying an anxiety disorder in your child can be difficult not only because her symptoms may be internal, but because certain signs of anxiety—particularly restlessness and poor concentration—may be misinterpreted as symptoms of ADHD. Children with an anxiety disorder, however, experience more than a general lack of focus or a restless response to boredom. Their anxiety and worry are clear-cut, often focusing on specific situations or thoughts. They may seem tense, irritable, tired, or stressed out. They may not sleep well, and may even experience brief panic attacks—involving pounding heart, difficulty breathing, nausea, shaking, and intense fears—that occur for no apparent reason.While their school performance may be equivalent to that of children with ADHD alone, they tend to experience a wider variety of social difficulties and have more problems at school than children with ADHD alone. At the same time, they may behave in less disruptive ways than children with ADHD alone because their anxiety inhibits spontaneous or impulsive behavior. Instead they may tend to seem inefficient or distracted—having a great deal of difficulty remembering facts or processing concepts or ideas. \t Your child can be an important source of information that may lead to a diagnosis of anxiety disorder, although some children are reluctant to admit to any symptoms even if they are quite significant. If the possibility of an anxiety disorder concerns you, be sure to discuss any fears or worries she has and listen carefully to her response. Report her comments to her pediatrician and/or psychologist, and encourage her to  speak directly with these professionals. \t In the meantime, ask yourself \t   Does she seem excessively worried or anxious about a number of situations or activities (such as peer relationships or school performance)?  Are her fears largely irrational—that is, overly exaggerated or unrealistic—rather than realistic worries about punishment for negative behavior? Does she find it difficult to control her worrying? \t Does her anxiety lead to restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability,muscle tension, and/or sleep disturbance? \t Does her anxiety or its outward symptoms significantly impair her social, academic, or other functioning? \t Does her anxiety occur more days than not, and continue for a significant duration?  Have her anxiety symptoms lasted for at least 6 months? Do her bouts of anxiety occur at least 3 to 5 times per week and last for at least an hour? \t Is her anxiety unrelated to another disorder, substance abuse, or other identifiable cause?  A child who is distressed over a life event, who is abusing drugs, or whose family is in conflict may exhibit some of the symptoms of anxiety disorder. It is important to consider these other causes as the reason for anxiety instead of a formal anxiety disorder. \t As a young child, did she experience developmental delays or severe anxiety at being separated froma parent, express frequent or numerous fears, or experience unusual stress?  Children with ADHD and a coexisting anxiety disorder are more likely to have experienced developmental delays in early childhood and more stressful life events such as parental divorce or separation. \t Have others in her family been diagnosed with anxiety disorders?  Anxiety disorders tend to run in families. A careful review of your family’s medical history may provide insight into your child’s condition.  These are some symptoms of anxiety disorders, and their presence may indicate a need to have your child evaluated by her pediatrician or mental health provider. The sooner your child is properly treated for anxiety, the sooner she can improve her functioning and balance in her daily life. \t Treatment \t Treatment for children with ADHD and an anxiety disorder relies on a combination of approaches geared to each child’s specific situation—including educating the child and her family about the condition, encouraging ongoing input from school personnel, initiating behavior therapy including cognitive behavioral techniques, as well as traditional psychotherapy, family therapy, and medication management. \t Behavior therapies are among the most proven and effective non-medication treatments for anxiety disorders. (The effectiveness of traditional psychotherapy has been less well studied.) Behavior therapies target  changing the child’s behaviors  caused by the anxiety rather than focusing on the child’s internal conflicts. Cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques help children  restructure their thoughts  into a more positive framework so that they can become more assertive and increase their level of positive functioning. For example, a child can learn to identify anxious feelings and thoughts, recognize how her body responds to anxiety, and devise a plan to cut down on these symptoms when they appear. Other behavioral techniques that can be used for treating anxiety include modeling appropriate behaviors, role-playing, relaxation techniques, and gradual desensitization to the specific experiences that make a given child anxious. \t Decisions about medication treatment of ADHD and a coexisting anxiety disorder depend largely on the relative strength of each condition. In the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA) study of  large numbers of children with ADHD and various coexisting conditions, behavioral treatments were equally as effective as medication treatment for children with ADHD and parent-reported anxiety symptoms. It was not known, however, how many of these children had true anxiety disorders. \t In general, if your child’s ADHD symptoms impede her functioning more than the anxiety does, and a medication approach is recommended, her pediatrician may choose to begin treating her with stimulants first. As he adjusts her dosage for maximal effect, he will monitor her for side effects such as jitteriness or overfocusing—possible responses to stimulants among children with ADHD and an anxiety disorder. If your child’s ADHD symptoms improve with stimulant medication and her anxiety diminishes as well, her pediatrician may want to review her diagnosis to discern whether the anxiety stemmed from the ADHD-related behavior and was not a sign of an anxiety disorder. If the ADHD symptoms improve but your child’s anxiety remains, her pediatrician may decide to add another type of medication. These medications can include a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA).",

        "content": "By: Claire McCarthy, MD, FAAP According to the National Institutes of Health, nearly      1 in 3   of all adolescents ages 13 to 18 will experience an anxiety disorder. These numbers have been rising steadily; between 2007 and 2012, anxiety disorders in children and teens      went up 20% .  These stats combined with the rate of hospital admissions for suicidal teenagers also      doubling  over the past decade leaves us with      many  concerning questions. \t What's causing the rise in teenagers with severe anxiety? How did we get here?   What's going on? While we don't know for sure, there are a number of factors that could be contributing. In addition to genetics, brain chemistry, personality, and life events, take the following into consideration: \t High expectations and pressure to succeed . Between standardized testing and a         culture of achievement , today's youth can feel pressure to succeed in ways previous generations did not. A survey done every year by         Higher Education Research  asks incoming college freshmen if they feel overwhelmed by all they have to do. In 2016, 41% of students said \"yes\" compared with 28% in 2000 and 18% in 1985.\t A world that feels scary and threatening.  We've seen an increase in school shootings, with resultant            drills and lockdowns in schools . We've seen shootings in public places. There have been terrorist attacks here in the US and around the world taking many lives. From just            watching or reading the news , it is reasonable for anyone to feel afraid in public spaces that previously would have felt safe. \t Social media.  Today's children and teens are            constantly connected  to social media. It's not surprising that their self-esteem―and worldview ―becomes connected to responses to social media posts. It's hard for them not to compare their life and social connections to what they see others posting on social media.  There are also some children who have unexpected and disproportionate reactions to normal developmental experiences like going to school, going to a party, doing a sleepover or going to camp; children who worry excessively about everyday life activities. This often starts in the years right before      puberty . Whatever the cause, this rise in anxiety is a real problem for our youth.  Chronic anxiety can lead to serious mental health problems― depression ,      substance use , and      even suicide . It can interfere with the ability to focus and learn causing school problems that can have lifelong impact. It can also lead to physical problems, such as headaches, chronic pain, digestive problems, and later heart disease.  Anxiety disorders cut across all demographics―suburban, urban, and rural. They affect those who are      college-bound  and those who are not. So, what can parents, teachers, and anyone else who interacts with children and teens do? \t Be aware of the signs of anxiety.  Sometimes children may say that they are anxious, but other times it is less clear―especially as they may not even realize it themselves. Signs can include: Recurring fears and worries abo ut routine parts of every day life Changes in behavior, such as irritability   Avoiding activities, school, or social interactions  Dropping grades or school avoidance Trouble sleeping or concentrating Substance use or other risky behaviors  Chronic physical complaints, such as fatigue, headaches, or stomachaches. \t Talk with kids about potential stressors.  Try to see the world the way they do—and help them to keep perspective and find ways to cope.  \t Be mindful of the expectations you set for children and teens.  High expectations can help children reach their potential, but they need to be realistic ones. Not only that, remember that kids need time to relax, play, and be with friends—all of which are crucial for their mental and physical health. And it's important for all of us to remember that there is more to life than achievement. \t Talk with kids about their social media use.  Help them take breaks—and help them think critically and rationally about the effect of social media on their lives.            See \t   How to Connect with Your Teen about Smart & Safe Media Use .\t   ​\t   The world is a challenging place.\t As parents (or anyone else who interacts with young  people), you have a very important role in helping children take on new challenges, build coping strategies, and learn the resiliency skills they need to adapt in the face of adversity. \t If you are noticing signs of anxiety in your child or are worried that something you are seeing could be related to anxiety, talk with your pediatrician.\t   ​ How pediatricians screen kids for anxiety: At visits―whether they are      well child visits  or appointments made because of a concern―pediatricians ask questions about a child's physical complaints, mood, behavior and activities, as well as what is going on at school, at home, and in other areas of life.  Pediatricians also use screening tools such as the      Pediatric Symptom Checklist  (PSC) that look for signs of various different mental health problems, including anxiety. Pediatricians often refer to      mental health professionals , as well, in order to more fully evaluate children when there is a concern.  Know anxiety is treatable!  According to the      Anxiety and Depression Association of America , 80% of kids with a diagnosable anxiety disorder are not getting treatment―and anxiety disorders are highly treatable! As with most problems, the earlier it is diagnosed the easier it is to treat.  The      most effective treatments  with for anxiety disorders are cognitive‐behavioral therapy (CBT) and SSRI medications. \t CBT  focuses on changing how the child thinks about his fear, increasing exposure to feared situations, and relaxation strategies such as deep breathing, muscle relaxation, and positive self‐talk (repeating positive or reassuring statements to oneself). Exposure therapy, a type of CBT, focuses on increasing exposure to feared objects or activities. \t SSRIs  (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) ―commonly prescribed antidepressants―are the medications most frequently used for treating anxiety disorders in children. Studies have found a combination of CBT and medication for 12 weeks yields a positive response in 80% of children with anxiety disorders. In fact, 65% of those children had no or minimal anxiety symptoms after the 12 weeks of treatment. With CBT alone, 60% had a positive response―about 35% of those children having no or minimal anxiety symptoms. However, it is important to note that SSRI medications can be administered safely and be an important part of child's anxiety disorder treatment. As with any mental health disorder, anything that supports general wellbeing is an important part of anxiety disorder treatment―regular sleep, exercise,      meditation , relaxation apps or      yoga  can be helpful. However, these are not a substitute for CBT or medication.  The most important thing is to be aware of your children's mental health, ask questions, and ask for help!

        "content": "If your child experiences major mood swings, paired with dramatic changes in the way they deal with school, family and friends, you may wonder if this is just part of growing up—or a sign of something more serious.    Mental health has been in the news lately, and virtually all parents and caregivers are concerned about it. Many of us assume that, with love and understanding, our kids will manage somehow. At the same time, we know that 1 of every 6 young people lives with a mental health condition that won't get better without professional help.  Around 1% to 2% of all U.S. kids under 18 live with    bipolar disorder , a condition associated with episodic shifts in mood and behavior. Here's what you need to know about bipolar disorder—and how to tell if your child might be struggling with it. With treatment, children and teens with bipolar disorder can get better over time. What is bipolar disorder? Once known as manic depression, bipolar disorder is a brain condition that causes extreme changes in mood. Depending on the type of bipolar disorder (bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, or cyclothymia), people with this condition go through    manic periods  marked by extremely elevated or irritable mood, and high energy. They sometimes may also have    depressive periods  when they feel sad, hopeless and discouraged. Children and adolescents are more likely to have mood fluctuation even within the acute manic or depressive episodes they experience. \t   Parents: Share this video about bipolar disorder with your child: Kids living with bipolar disorder might also show symptoms that are confusingly similar to those of other common childhood disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ), disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), as well as    major depression ,    anxiety , \t conduct and substance use disorders .    Childhood trauma  also plays a critical role in mental health. These are just some of the reasons that medical professionals often find it hard to make a clear diagnosis, even when kids show several signs that they may have bipolar disorder.  What do bipolar episodes look like in children and teens? Kids who live with bipolar go through dramatic and episodic changes in sleep, mood and energy levels, making it hard for them to think clearly and get along with others. \t When a child is experiencing mania, they might:  Act incredibly happy, silly or even giddy Feel more irritable or impatient than usual Talk rapidly, hopping from subject to subject Need much less sleep than usual without feeling tired Struggle to stay focused on one task or topic Show strong interest in dangerous/risky activities Make snap decisions that seem out of character Lose or break things they value (mobile phones, bikes, jewelry, etc.) Experience more conflicts or misunderstandings with others\t   When they're in a depressed mood, kids with bipolar disorder might:  Feel sad, discouraged or hopeless Show more anger and irritability than usual Complain of pain, such as stomach troubles or headaches Sleep much more than usual—or have trouble getting to sleep Experience \"brain fog\" that makes it hard for them to concentrate Have much less energy than normal for them Turn away from friends, family and activities they usually love Eat too much or too little Talk or think about death or suicide My child has a few of these bipolar disorder symptoms. Should I be worried? Most young people go through times of stress, doubt and fear that might make it hard for them to sleep, handle schoolwork or relate well to family and friends. This built-in volatility is part of growing up, especially in a time when    social media  reflects strong pressures for kids to fit in.   \t The challenge of determining what is \"normal\" mood variability and what might instead be bipolar disorder has puzzled medical experts for some time. Until recently, many believed that bipolar disorder could not be diagnosed until the early to mid-20s, when a young person's brain is more fully developed.   \t Newer studies have helped us understand that many kids do, in fact, live with bipolar disorder—which means they need specialized help and support. How will I know if my child should be evaluated for bipolar disorder? Here are some questions that can help you think about your child's symptoms and determine when to call your pediatrician for help. Do mood shifts get in the way of my child's ability to handle everyday life? Am I seeing episodes of intense \"highs\" and/or \"lows\" that dramatically change their thoughts and behaviors? Are these patterns dramatically different from the way my child used to feel and act? Are their school, sports, friendships and family life suffering?\t As you consider these questions, keep in mind that even if bipolar disorder is not the cause, your child urgently needs help.  Kids whose lives are seriously disrupted by mental health symptoms will NOT just \"snap out of it.\" Without proper care, many struggle for years, suffering judgment and stigma along the way. You can prevent this by seeking help now. Is it common for parents to struggle, too? Absolutely. Many parents don't feel they know anything about mental health, so they shy away from the subject. Others feel guilty or ashamed, assuming they're the source of their child's difficulties (especially if there's a family history of mental illness or their child has suffered from    abuse, violence or other trauma .) If you're struggling to ask for help, think of it this way.    You'd never fail to call the doctor if your child had a broken bone, a terrible cough or a painful skin rash. Mental health is no less real than these physical conditions.  And with millions of kids in virtually every part of the country facing mental health issues, you and your child are not alone. What kind of bipolar disorder treatment will my child receive? After a careful evaluation to determine if bipolar disorder is an appropriate diagnosis that explains your child's symptoms, health care providers will put together an age-appropriate treatment plan. A combination of medication, cognitive (talk) therapy and calming strategies may be recommended. Sleep will be crucial, too, since    getting enough rest  is critical for brain health, especially for children and teens. Typically, your pediatrician will be part of your child's    care team , along with a psychiatrist who specializes in managing medications for psychiatric conditions. Kids with bipolar disorder also benefit from talk therapy that helps them deal with fears and doubts that people usually face when they're diagnosed with a serious (and possibly lifelong) health condition. Support groups can be helpful, too—and not just for kids. The National Alliance on Mental Illness ( NAMI ) offers    resources and support groups  for children, teens, parents and families. The Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance ( DBSA ) also offers support groups for people of all ages, including family and friends of people living with bipolar. What if my child is having suicidal thoughts? Call 988 immediately if your child is thinking of suicide or threatening to hurt themselves. This new number links you to the national    Suicide and Crisis Lifeline , where experts will help you find emergency care close to home.

        "content": "It's normal for children and teens to feel down sometimes. When kids experience a difficult event such as the loss of a loved one, for example, they may feel grief or deep sadness. For a while, they may not be able to feel happy even when doing the things they usually enjoy. It is normal for  grief  to lessen over time, though. Depression is not the same as sadness or grief.  Depression is a mood disorder that causes sadness and related symptoms to be more intense or last longer than usual after a difficult event. Depression can also occur without a triggering event. Children may have depression if their symptoms, which may include sadness, occur every day for more than 2 weeks. Children and teens may not always know how to describe what they are feeling, or may try to avoid talking about it. Older children and teens may try to hide their feelings because they don't want to bother others, for example. However, there are some common signs that of depression you may notice. Any of these signs can occur in children who are not depressed, but when seen together, nearly every day, they are red flags for depression. The two most common signs of depression in children & teens Seems more sad and irritable than usual, in a low mood for most of the day No longer enjoys activities that used to make them happy Other common signs & symptoms of depression Kids & teens of all ages: Spending more time alone and less time with friends Trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeps more than usual More trouble focusing or making choices Struggling or failing at school A marked change in weight or eating, either up or down Talks less and makes less eye contact than usual Spending more time using  media Has less energy or motivation than usual for even simple tasks   Cries more often or mentions feeling sad, worthless or guilty about things Among teens & adolescents: Not caring or feeling hopeful about the future Lacking interest in personal grooming or appearance Engaging in substance use\t How common is depression in young people? Depression is one of the most common disorders in the United States, and rates among children and teens have been rising in recent years. As many as 1 in 5 adolescents has depression at some point during their teen years. Every year, about 1 out of 11 adolescents has an episode of major depression. Experts estimate that between 2% and 3% of children aged 3 to 11 years have depression. Although it is not common, children as young as 3 years have been diagnosed with depression. Depression in a young child is very concerning and can lead to more serious consequences. Are there different types of depression? Major depressive disorder A doctor or another licensed mental health professional diagnoses major depressive disorder when at least five symptoms of depression last for more than 2 weeks, on most days. Although major depressive disorder can be mild, moderate or severe, all kids with major depressive disorder tend to have difficulty managing everyday life. Persistent depressive disorder This type of depression is less severe, and children who have it may be able to manage their activities. However, they are not at their best and often feel down. Usually, a doctor diagnoses persistent depressive disorder when symptoms last for more than a year. A child with persistent depressive disorder may also have an episode of major depression at the same time. What can I do if my child seems depressed? Talking with your child It is important to openly talk with your child about what your child is feeling. Encourage them to share their feelings by listening without judgment. Often children or adolescents do not bring up the topic of their feelings but may respond honestly if you ask directly. Regardless of what your child says, if you notice signs of depression for more than two weeks, talk with your child's doctor. Getting help Your child's doctor can help determine whether your child is depressed. They have specific questionnaires and techniques for age-appropriate ways of talking with children and adolescents about feelings of sadness. In fact, many screen patients for depression every year from ages 12 through 21, with suicide now a leading cause of death among adolescents. If your child has depression, the doctor may provide treatment or refer your family to a mental health specialist for  treatment .  Supporting your child Although treatment of depression works, it may take a few weeks. Your child may get discouraged when they don't feel better right away. Make sure they follow the treatment plan, attending therapy and taking any medicines prescribed as directed. In the meantime, there are things you can do at home to support them: Educate yourself, other caregivers & other family members.  A child who feels depressed is not making up symptoms. What might look like laziness or irritability is a symptom of depression. Let your child know that feelings of hopelessness are a symptom  of depression and are not an accurate picture of reality. Focus on your child's strengths , rather than areas that need improving, and provide verbal encouragement. H elp your child look at problems in a different, more positive way. Help your child relax  and with physical, creative, nurturing and meaningful activities. Encourage them to get a healthy amount of exercise, sleep and nutritious foods, which can help boost mood.    While socializing is helpful, limit \"social\" screen time.  Communicating by text or social  media  isn’t a substitute for face-to-face time with friends or family in person; it can actually make your child feel more cut off from others.  Safety planning & suicide prevention It can be very scary to even think about your child hurting themself. But if they feel depressed, take extra steps to help make your home a safe place. Remove  guns  and other weapons, alcohol, medicines and harmful household chemicals. If you can’t remove these items, store them safely (for example, in a lockbox). Other steps: Identifying warning signs/triggers.  Your child should write down the thoughts or situations that generally lead to having thoughts of  suicide . They can also list things that they can do, when they are feeling depressed or thinking about suicide, to help them feel better. Make a list of people, and their phone numbers, who can help  when your child is under stress or experiencing the warning signs in step 1. This can include family and friends and their therapist or doctor. Also, add the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) and the Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741 to connect with a trained counselor). You can ask your child or teen’s doctor for a  safety plan you can fill out . Remember Don't hesitate to    talk with your child's pediatrician  if you have any questions or concerns about their mental health.

        "content": "Disruptive behavior disorders are among the easiest to identify of all coexisting conditions because they involve behaviors that are readily seen such as temper tantrums, physical aggression such as attacking other children, excessive argumentativeness,  stealing, and other forms of defiance or resistance to authority. These disorders, which include ODD and CD, often first attract notice when they interfere with school performance or family and peer relationships, and frequently intensify over time. \t Behaviors typical of disruptive behavior disorders can closely resemble ADHD—particularly where impulsivity and hyperactivity are involved—but ADHD, ODD, and CD are considered separate conditions that can occur independently. About one third of all children with ADHD have coexisting ODD, and up to one quarter have coexisting CD. Children with both conditions tend to have more difficult lives than those with ADHD alone because their defiant behavior leads to so many conflicts with adults and others with whom they interact. Early identification and treatment may, however, increase the chances that your child can learn to control these behaviors. \t Oppositional Defiant Disorder \t Many children with ADHD display oppositional behaviors at times. Oppositional defiant disorder is defined in the American Psychiatric Association’s  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)  as including persistent symptoms of “negativistic, defiant, disobedient, and hostile behaviors toward authority figures.” A child with ODD may argue frequently with adults; lose his temper easily; refuse to follow rules; blame others for his own mistakes; deliberately annoy others; and otherwise behave in angry, resentful, and vindictive ways. He is likely to encounter frequent social conflicts and disciplinary situations at school. In many cases, particularly without early diagnosis and treatment, these symptoms worsen over time—sometimes becoming severe enough to eventually lead to a diagnosis of conduct disorder. \t Conduct Disorder \t Conduct disorder is a more extreme condition than ODD. Defined in the  DSM-IV  as “a repetitive and persistent pattern  of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age appropriate social rules are violated,” CD may involve serious aggression toward people or the hurting of animals, deliberate destruction of property (vandalism), stealing, running away from home, skipping school, or otherwise trying to break some of the major rules of society without getting caught. Many children with CD were or could have been diagnosed with ODD at an earlier age—particularly those who were physically aggressive when they were younger. As the CD symptoms become evident, these children usually retain their ODD symptoms (argumentativeness, resistance, etc) as well. This cluster of behaviors, combined with the impulsiveness and hyperactivity of ADHD, sometimes causes these children to be viewed as delinquents, and they are likely to be suspended from school and have more police contact than children with ADHD alone or ADHD with ODD. \t Children with ADHD whose CD symptoms started at an early age also tend to fare more poorly in adulthood than those with ADHD alone or ADHD with ODD—particularly in the areas of delinquency, illegal behavior, and substance abuse. \t ODD and CD: What to Look For \t A child with ADHD and a coexisting disruptive behavior disorder is likely to be similar to children with ADHD alone in terms of intelligence, medical history, and neurological development. He is probably no more impulsive than children with ADHD alone, although if he has conduct disorder, his teachers or other adults may misinterpret his aggressive behavior as ADHD-type impulsiveness. (Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder behavior without CD, however, does not typically involve this level of aggression.) A child with ADHD and CD does have a greater chance of experiencing learning disabilities such as reading disorders and verbal impairment. But what distinguishes children with ODD and CD most from children with ADHD alone  is their defiant, resistant, even (in the case of CD) aggressive, cruel, or delinquent, behavior. Other indicators to look for include \t   Relatives with ADHD/ODD, ADHD/CD, depressive disorder or anxiety disorder.  A child with family members with ADHD/ODD or ADHD/CD should be watched for ADHD/CD as well. Chances of developing CD are also greater if family members have experienced depressive, anxiety, or learning disorders. \t Stress or conflict in the family.  Divorce, separation, substance abuse, parental criminal activity, or serious conflicts within the family are quite common among children with ADHD and coexisting ODD or CD. \t Poor or no positive response to the behavior therapy techniques at home and at school.  If your child defies your instructions, violates time-out procedures, and otherwise refuses to cooperate with your use of appropriate behavior therapy techniques, and his aggressive behavior continues unabated, he should be evaluated for coexisting ODD or CD. \t Treatment \t Children with ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders often benefit from special behavioral techniques that can be implemented at home and at school. These approaches typically include methods for training your child to become more aware of his own anger cues, use these cues as signals to initiate various coping strategies (“Take five deep breaths and think about the three best choices for how to respond before lashing out at a teacher.”), and provide himself with positive reinforcement (telling himself, “Good job, you caught the signal and used your strategies!”) for successful self-control. You and your child’s teachers, meanwhile, can learn to better manage ODD or CD-type behavior through negotiating, compromising, problem-solving with your child, anticipating and avoiding potentially explosive situations, and prioritizing goals so that less important problems are ignored until more pressing issues have been successfully addressed. These highly specific techniques can be taught by professional behavior therapists or other mental health professionals recommended by your child’s pediatrician or school psychologist, or other professionals involved with your family. \t If your child has a diagnosis of coexisting ODD or CD, and well-planned classroom behavioral techniques in his mainstream classroom have been ineffective, this may lead to a decision to place him in a special classroom at school that is set up for more intensive behavior management. However, schools are mandated to educate your child in a mainstream classroom if possible, and to regularly review your child’s education plan and reassess the appropriateness of his placement. \t There is growing evidence that the same stimulant medications that improve the core ADHD symptoms may also help coexisting ODD and CD. Stimulants have been shown to help decrease verbal and physical aggression, negative peer interactions, stealing, and vandalism. Although stimulant medications do not teach children new skills, such as helping them identify and respond appropriately to others’ social signals, they may decrease the aggression that stands in the way of forming relationships with others their age. For this reason, stimulants are usually the first choice in a medication treatment approach for children with ADHD and a coexisting disruptive behavior disorder. \t The earlier stimulants are introduced to treat coexisting ODD or CD, the better. A child with a disruptive behavior disorder whose aggressive behavior continues untreated may start to identify with others who experience discipline problems. By  adolescence, he may resist treatment that could help him change his behavior and make him less popular among these friends. He will have grown accustomed to his defiant “self” and feel uncomfortable and “unreal” when stimulants help check his reckless, authority-flaunting style. By treating these behaviors in elementary school or even earlier, you may have a better chance of preventing your child from creating a negative self-identity. \t If your child has been treated with 2 or more types of stimulants and his aggressive symptoms are the same or worse, his pediatrician may choose to reevaluate the situation and replace the stimulant with other medications. If stimulant medication alone led to some but not enough improvement, his pediatrician may continue to prescribe stimulants in combination with one of these other agents.",

        "content": "Children (as well as adults) use food for reasons other than to satisfy their hunger and  nutritional needs . In fact, obese youngsters often eat in response to their emotions and feelings.\t Consider whether your own parents used food for comfort in your household. This is a common phenomenon, beginning at birth. A baby’s crying or irritability is typically met with  breast milk  or  infant formula , and feeding becomes a way of calming and quieting him. At birthdays and holidays, when children are surrounded by family and are feeling loved, they’re often given cookies or other desserts that become a symbol of this love and caring.\t These days, whenever your own child is feeling  anxious , perhaps related to an upcoming math test or because he’s being teased at school, he may turn back to food as one way of making him feel better. At the same time, however, there are many other reasons beyond comfort that may prompt children to eat. \t Does your youngster sometimes reach for food when he’s experiencing any of the following?\t \t  Boredom\t   Insecurity\t   Anger\t   Depression \t   Loneliness\t   Happiness\t   Stress \t   Fatigue\t   Frustration\t   Resentment\t Even though food can become a welcome companion for your child, the outcome may not be quite what he expected. Ironically, if he overeats as a way to soften feelings of insecurity or  depression , for instance, or perhaps because of stress over an oral report he needs to give at school, he may feel even worse after a  food binge , knowing that it can aggravate his weight problem. Before the food is even digested, he might be feeling guilt or shame.\t In fact, one of your biggest parenting challenges is for you and your child to determine whether he’s eating for the right reasons. Ask yourself questions like, does he eat at times other than regular mealtimes and snacks? Is he munching at every opportunity? What factors might be contributing to his overeating that call for you to intervene?\t Avoid rewarding children with food\t Some parents inadvertently contribute to their children’s obesity by rewarding their youngsters with food (does an A on a test sometimes lead to a trip to the ice cream shop?). There are other, healthier ways to offer praise and rewards. For a young child, how about giving him a few stickers as a reward, or perhaps schedule a shopping trip to buy a toy or new pair of shoes?\t Don’t overlook the importance of verbal praise. When your child is doing things right, tell him. Notice how words of approval can  boost his self-esteem  and help keep him motivated to continue making the right decisions for his health and weight. Even when he’s having difficulties staying on course with his diet, look for other ways to offer praise (“You walked more than half a mile today, that’s so great!”).When he backslides, don’t nag him or make him feel like he has failed. Encourage him to keep moving forward, and even if he complains from time to time (“I want a soft drink, not ice water”), encourage him to stay the course. Offer him all the support he needs and deserves.\t Watch your words\t It’s important for parents to listen to how they’re speaking to their children. Is it mostly negative? Is it often critical? It’s hard for anyone, including children, to make changes in that kind of environment. Some parents actually try to embarrass their overweight children into making changes (“Billy, you’re getting fatter again!”), figuring that if he sees himself as unsightly, he’ll be motivated to lose weight. Don’t count on that strategy working. Even if your child is able to make changes under these circumstances, those improvements are not likely to last without some parental praise and  positive reinforcement  along the way.",

        "content": "As children grow and explore the world around them, facing new experiences and challenges, occasional fears are common. Common childhood fears A fear of being alone in the dark, for example, is a common childhood fear. So is a fear of animals, such as large barking dogs. Some children are afraid of fires, high places or thunderstorms. Others, conscious of  media images , are concerned about war or terrorism. If there has been a recent serious illness or  death  in the family, they may become anxious about the health of those around them. Your child's fears may come and go. Most childhood fears are mild. But even when they get worse, with reassurance and support, they generally go away on their own after a while. How parents can help ease their child's fears Here are some suggestions that many parents find useful to help their children with fears. What to do: Talk with your child about their anxieties, and be sympathetic.  Explain to them that many children have fears, but with your support they can learn to overcome them. Monitor your child's media use.  This includes exposure to frightening images in movies, online videos and violent video games. Make sure media is age-appropriate. It also a good idea to  create a family media plan . What to avoid doing: Do not belittle or ridicule your child's fears , particularly in front of their peers. Do not try to pressure your child into being brave.  It will take time for them to confront and gradually move beyond their anxieties. When does fear becomes a phobia? Sometimes, however, fears can become so extreme, persistent and focused that they develop into phobias.  Phobias — which are strong and irrational fears — can significantly interfere with a child's usual daily activities. For example, a  6-year-old 's phobia about dogs might make them so panicky that they refuse to go outdoors at all because there could be a dog there. A 10-year-old child might become so terrified about news reports of a serial killer that they insist on sleeping with his parents at night. Social phobias Some children develop phobias about the people they meet in their everyday lives. This severe shyness can keep them from making friends at school and relating to most adults, especially strangers. They might consciously avoid social situations like birthday parties, club meetings or sports practices. They may find it difficult to talk comfortably with anyone except their immediate family. Separation anxiety  is also common in children. Sometimes this fear can intensify when the family moves to a new neighborhood or starts a new childcare setting. These children might become afraid of going to summer camp or even attending  school . Their phobias can cause physical symptoms like headaches or stomach pains.  Treatment for childhood fears & phobias Fortunately, most phobias are quite treatable. If your child's anxieties persist and interfere with their enjoyment of day-to-day life, they might benefit from meeting with a child psychiatrist or psychologist who specializes in treating phobias. Behavioral therapy As part of the treatment plan for phobias, many therapists suggest exposing your child to the source of their anxiety in small, nonthreatening doses.  Under a therapist's guidance, a child who is afraid of  dogs  might begin by talking about this fear and by looking at photos or videos of dogs. Next, they might watch a neighborhood dog from behind the safety of a window. Then, with a parent or a therapist at their side, they might spend a few minutes in the same room with a friendly, gentle puppy. Eventually they will find themselves able to pet the dog. Over time, they will ease into situations with larger, unfamiliar dogs. This gradual process is called  desensitization , meaning that your child will become a little less sensitive to the source of their fear each time they confront it. Ultimately, your child will no longer feel the need to avoid the situation that has been the basis of their phobia.  Sometimes psychotherapy can also help children become more self-assured and less fearful.  Breathing  and relaxation exercises can help children in stressful circumstances too. Behavior therapy is the first line of treatment of phobias. In rare cases, where behavioral therapy isn't helping enough, your child's doctor may recommend medications as art of the treatment program. This would be in addition to the behavioral therapy, and not as the sole therapeutic tool. These drugs may include antidepressants, which are designed to ease the anxiety and panic that often underlie these problems.

        "content": "Fecal soiling, referred to medically as  encopresis   in children over four years of age, affects about 1.5 percent of young school children, with boys outnumbering girls by a ratio of six to one. While much rarer than accidental urination or minor leaks, it can be more upsetting to both parent and child. Not only is the odor more noticeable and disturbing, but children as young as two are expected in our culture to “know better” than to soil their pants. \t In most cases, however, fecal soiling is not voluntary, but occurs when emotional stress, resistance to toilet training, or physical pain during bowel movements causes a child to resist having bowel movements. This resistance, or stool retention, leads to constipation, which in turn leads to involuntary leakage or soiling when the pressure becomes too great. If this continues to happen, the muscles involved in stool ejection may begin to stretch, and nerve sensations in the area diminish, making it more difficult for the child to feel the need to defecate. The intestines may lose their ability to contract, making bowel movements even more of a challenge and fecal soiling more likely.\t In most cases, the best way to approach the problem of fecal soiling due to constipation is to address the underlying issue that is causing your child to resist having a bowel movement. He may stop retaining stool if you ease the pressure to use the potty, for example, or if you stay with him while he defecates—and as his bowel movements become more regular, his fecal soiling may disappear. \t If the problem continues beyond one or two accidents, however, be sure to make an appointment with your child’s pediatrician. He will review your child’s medical history to determine whether a physical condition rather than stool retention may be causing the soiling. Congenital megacolon or Hirschsprung’s disease (a congenital condition that prevents a child from feeling the sensation of having a full bowel), ulcerative colitis, allergies, or even a diet containing too many dairy products or high-fat foods can sometimes lead to accidental soiling. \t If these physical causes have also been eliminated, emotional or psychological causes should be considered. Fecal soiling can occur when a child is anxious or emotionally distraught over some aspect of his life over which he has little control, such as family conflicts, academic difficulties, or problems with social relationships. Physical and sexual abuse may also need to be considered if soiling continues. \t Of course, it is quite possible for any young child to have even this kind of accident once or twice. No matter what the cause, your child needs to know—and needs to know that  you  know—that what has happened is not his fault. \t As with bedwetting, the situation is best corrected by quickly cleaning up, avoiding shame and embarrassment as much as possible, and providing him with the information he needs to better control his bowel movements and keep his clothes clean. Once your child’s feelings are protected, you can take action to identify the underlying cause, with the understanding that a remedy may take some time.",

        "content": "Many children and adolescents with depression do not get the treatment they need. This may be because they have never been diagnosed, they do not have access to mental health care or they are embarrassed to seek care. Kids who do not receive treatment do not function at their best, and their symptoms may worsen over time. Treatment of depression is effective but may take a while. Following through with treatment, even when, at first, it seems to not be working, is important. Depression treatment options: determining what's best for your child Treating depression may involve family therapy, psychotherapy (talk therapy), medicine, or combined medicine and therapy. The kind of treatment a child receives depends on: the    type of depression  they have  how severe it is how long they have experienced the symptoms their age and other factors specific to them and their family    Different treatment options include: Support from your child's doctor Your child's doctor may choose to support, monitor and educate you and your child as a first step. This may work well if they know your family well and your child's symptoms are not severe. With this approach, the doctor will work with your family to keep a close watch on symptoms, assessing your child weekly.  They can also help your child think in new ways about themselves, and encourage healthy habits that are known to lessen depression symptoms. If symptoms do not improve or your child's depression worsens, the doctor may refer you and your child to a mental health specialist. Psychotherapy Certain types of psychotherapy can help children with depression. Be sure to confirm that the mental health specialist who cares for your child is specifically trained in the method recommended for your child.\t Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT).  Specially trained professionals provide this type of therapy. It focuses on helping a child or adolescent become aware of situations that are troubling, identify feelings or beliefs about these situations, change any negative or inaccurate beliefs and thoughts and learn ways to cope with stress. CBT is usually limited to a particular number of sessions, often concluding when specific skills are learned. \"Homework\" is often provided to practice these skills between sessions.\t Interpersonal psychotherapy for adolescents (IPT-A).  IPT-A helps a child or adolescent address relationship issues and improves their ability to socialize. IPT-A can also help with transitions (such as moving or divorce),    grief , and conflicts with family or peers. The therapy is for a limited time, and your child may have homework, or participate in group therapy, provided by a psychologist or a counselor with special training.\t  \t Family therapy Family therapy is a type of counseling that helps a family understand each other better and learn coping skills to deal with stress. When one member of a family is experiencing a mental health issue, family therapy can help the rest of the family feel supported, learn ways to support each other and reduce conflict. Medicine Your child's doctor may prescribe medicine, an antidepressant, to treat depression. Research shows that children and adolescents with major depression have the best results from CBT (cognitive behavior therapy) combined with medicine. The most commonly used antidepressants for depression in children are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). If your child is taking medicine for depression, it will take a while to titrate (adjust) the medicine and find the dose that works best. The dose will be lower at first and then increased. Sometimes children will need to try more than one SSRI to find one that works best.  It is important to note any side effects and report them to the doctor. The most common side effect is abdominal pain. However, the pain lessens as the patient continues to use the medicine. Other side effects of SSRIs include: Dry mouth\t Constipation Diarrhea Sweating\t Sleep problems Irritability Increased impulsivity or the child doing things that they might not otherwise do Agitation Jitteriness\t Headache Appetite changes If you or your child notice any of the following side effects, you should call the doctor right away: Rash Combined fever, chills, restlessness, and confusion Combined    dizziness , drowsiness, nausea, and headache Feeling restless and unable to be still Agitation, silliness, speaking too fast, feeling overenergetic and sleeping less than usual Increase in    suicidal thoughts It may take 4 to 6 weeks of taking an antidepressant for your child to feel any effect. Keep in mind that results may vary for each child. Also, it is important to never stop taking an antidepressant quickly. When it is time to stop taking the medicine, the pediatrician or mental health specialist will slowly reduce the dose of the drug over several weeks to avoid withdrawal side effects. About the FDA black box warning You may have heard that selective SSRIs have a boxed warning (commonly referred to as \"black box warning\") from the U.S. Food and Drug (FDA) Administration. The boxed warning calls attention to serious or life-threatening risks. The FDA tests and approves medicines before they can be sold. The details of the black box warning are important to understand because some parents and adolescents feel hesitant about medicine that seems harmful. In 2004, the FDA added a black box warning for antidepressants for children and adolescents. The FDA reviewed 24 research studies with more than 4,400 children and adolescents who had been prescribed any of 9 antidepressants. No child died by suicide in any of these trials. FDA officials found that about 2 out of 100 children not taking antidepressants would report suicidal thoughts or behaviors, compared to 4 out of 100 who were taking antidepressants. Many research studies show that antidepressants are safe and effective at treating children with depression. The black box warning is intended to encourage parents and doctors to ask about suicidal thoughts. Remember Talk with your child's doctor if you have any questions about your child's mental health.

        "content": "​\t  If you have a mental disorder and are considering having children or already have children, one of the questions you are probably asking yourself is whether you could pass your mental disorder on to your child. Incidence  According to the National Institute of Mental Health, about 25% of US adults (ages 18 and older) and about 13% of US children (ages 8 to 15) are diagnosed with a mental disorder each year. Examples of mental disorders include:\t Depression  – Affects 10% of the population.\t Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)  – Affects 5%-11% of the population.\t Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)  – Affects 1 in 68 children. Substance use disorders (addiction) – Affects 10% of the population.\t Schizophrenia  – Affects 1% of the population.\t Bipolar Disorder  – Affects 2%-3% of the population.  Diagnosing Mental Disorders  Doctors diagnose mental disorders based on the signs and symptoms of the individual patient. Doctors use the     \t Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)  to assist in diagnosing mental disorders.  There are no genetic tests to confirm a diagnosis of mental disorder. Because experiences and environment play an important role in the development of a mental disorder, no genetic test will ever be able to tell with absolute certainty who will and who will not develop a mental disorder.  What does it mean if a mental disorder seems to run in my family? \t   The chance of an individual having a specific mental disorder is higher if other family members have that same mental disorder. Even though a mental disorder may      run in a family , there may be considerable differences in the severity of symptoms among family members. This means that one person in the family may have a mild case, while someone else has a more se​vere case of the mental disorder. Mental disorders, however, do not follow typical patterns of inheritance.  Causes of Mental Disorders Most mental disorders are caused by a combination of multiple genetic and environmental factors. This is called      multifactorial inheritance . Many other common medical problems such as      type 2 diabetes ,      obesity , and      asthma  also undergo multifactorial inheritance.  Environmental factors Environmental factors contributing to the development of mental disorders include:\t Trauma:  Sexual, physical, and emotional         abuse  during childhood all lead to an increase in the likelihood of developing a mental disorder. Highly stressful home environments,         loss of a loved one , and         natural disasters  are also major contributors. \t Emotional harm:  Negative school experiences and         bullying  can also result in severe long-term emotional damage. The realization of these issues has led to anti-bullying campaigns nationwide, and the implementation of these campaigns has placed a larger importance on the overall mental health of school-aged children and teens.\t Substance Abuse:  Exposure tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs either prenatally or in childhood has been associated with the development of mental disorders beyond just         substance use disorders or addiction .  Environmental factors alone do not cause mental disorders. Genetic factors also play a part in developing a mental disorder.  Genetic factors  Genetic factors contributing to the development of mental disorders include:\t Epigenetic regulation:  Epigenetics affect how a person reacts to environmental factors and may affect whether that person develops a mental disorder as a result. Epigenetics is not constant over time. This means a gene is not always \"on\" or \"off.\" There must be the right combination of environmental factors and epigenetic regulation for a mental disorder to develop. \t Genetic polymorphisms:  These changes in our DNA make us unique as individuals.   A polymorphism alone will not lead to the development of a mental disorder. However, the combination of one or more specific polymorphisms and certain environmental factors may lead to the development of a mental disorder.  \t Single gene changes:  Rare. Remember…  Mental disorders are the result of both genetic and environmental factors. There is no single genetic switch that when flipped causes a mental disorder. Consequently, it is difficult for doctors to determine a person's risk of inheriting a mental disorder or passing on the disorder to their children. The causes of mental disorders are complex, requiring many interacting genes and environmental factors.

        "content": "In the United States, as many as 10 million females and 1 million males are fighting a life-and-death battle with an  eating disorder  such as  anorexia  or  bulimia . Millions more are struggling with  binge-eating disorder . The true number is difficult to know because many people manage to hide their eating problems even from those closest to them. Once thought to be restricted to middle- and upper-income families, eating disorders are increasingly found at every social and economic level.\t Eating disorders most commonly start in girls between  ages 14 and 17  years but are also seen in adolescent boys and  younger children . Overall, girls with eating disorders outnumber boys by about 10 to 1. The roots of the problem appear to be complex. Outside influences are one contributor to eating disorders; for example,  magazines , movies, and television promote thinness. Most young people can deal with the message, but those who develop an eating disorder are more susceptible and cannot keep the media images in perspective. Young people are rarely aware of the extent to which images are altered to make models or actresses appear perfect, and they aspire to what they perceive as perfect beauty. However, there are invariably more complex and deep-seated psychological issues and genetic vulnerabilities that influence who is susceptible, including low self-esteem.\t No age group is immune. Eating disorders in children younger than 14 years are described as childhood onset. Some women secretly persist in eating disorders from their teens into their 20s, 30s, and beyond. Others develop abnormal eating and exercise behaviors in response to stress long after adolescence is over. This type of eating and overconcern with body shape and image is an occupational hazard for those whose jobs or activities rely on appearance, such as fashion models,  dancers  and other performers, and competitive athletes like  gymnasts .\t Types of Eating Disorders \t The principal eating disorders are anorexia nervosa, or self-starvation, and bulimia nervosa, or binge eating followed by purging through induced vomiting or laxative abuse to prevent weight gain. Another less “formal” but common eating disorder is bulimorexia—starvation alternating with gorging and induced purging. Whatever the specific behavior and diagnosis, those with eating disorders share a preoccupation with their food, weight, and shape; have a severely erratic or inadequate food intake; and can’t regulate their eating and related emotions. They often have other symptoms of  anxiety ,  depression , and obsessive-compulsive thoughts and symptoms. Some develop  substance use problems  over time. Girls who start menstruating earlier than their peers tend to have more problems with body image and a somewhat higher risk of eating disorders. Children from families with eating disorders and  obsessive-compulsive disorders  are also more vulnerable.\t Eating Disorder Risk Factors*\t Family history of eating disorder or  obesity\t Affective illness or  alcoholism  in first-degree relatives\t Ballet, gymnastics, modeling, “visual sports”\t Personality traits (eg, perfectionism)\t Parental eating behavior and weight\t Physical or  sexual abuse\t Low self-esteem\t Body-image dissatisfaction\t History of excessive dieting, frequently skipped meals, compulsive exercise \t *Source: Rome ES, Ammerman S, Rosen DS, et al. Children and adolescents with eating disorders: the state of the art. Pediatrics. 2003;111:e98–e108\t Risks for Adolescent Athletes\t High school  and  college  athletes are particularly susceptible to eating disorders. For example, some coaches encourage  wrestlers  to develop strength by training above their weight limits but competing at a lower weight, just under the limit. Wrestlers may be pressured to lose several pounds in the few days before a competition. Adolescent athletes are often urged to follow drastic and unbalanced weight-loss regimens (eg, eating only bananas or oranges for days). In the past, several college wrestlers died when trying to make a weight class by going without food and water and working out while wearing special clothing to promote sweating. These practices are unsafe. \t The American College of Sports Medicine and some states have released guidelines for weight control and monitoring high school and collegiate wrestlers ( www.acsm.org ). Coaches should be responsible for encouraging healthful eating and exercise. Parents who suspect that their children are subjected to dangerous or abusive practices should stop their children’s involvement and bring their concerns to the attention of school or college authorities.\t Common Forerunners for Eating Disorders\t Be on the lookout for  diet fads , especially with adolescent girls. Some, such as  high-protein , very low-carbohydrate regimens, require medical supervision when used in adolescents. They’ve been around for decades and resurface periodically under new names. The more extreme diet routines are never intended for long-term adoption. Prescription and nonprescription over-the-counter and over-the-Internet preparations and  supplements  are poorly regulated and have contributed to serious and deadly problems. \t Ephedra-containing over-the-counter diet aids illustrate the hazards of these products. In 2004, after compounds containing ephedra or the related compound ephedrine were found to be associated with a number of deaths, they were banned by the Food and Drug Administration. Fenphen combination prescription  diet pills  led to fatal  heart  complications in some users in the 1990s. Ipecac abuse by people with eating disorders caused permanent damage to hearts.",

        "content": "All kids feel anxious or worried at times. For some, anxious thoughts won't go away. And with these thoughts, your child or teen may feel an intense need to repeat very specific actions. They may not be able to explain why, but often they feel it is to protect themselves or someone they love.    This pattern of recurring thoughts and behaviors can mean a child is struggling with obsessive-compulsive disorder, or    OCD . Parents and caregivers are often the first to notice possible signs of OCD in kids. Since getting care early is the key to supporting a child's lifelong health, it's important to take action if you're concerned your child might have OCD.  Here's what you should know about this condition and what to do if you believe your child might need help. Understanding what OCD is (and isn't)  OCD is an anxiety disorder that affects an estimated 1% to 3% of all children and teens. It often affects kids who have other developmental-behavioral conditions such as    ADHD ,    depression ,    bipolar disorder  or    eating disorders .   \t \t  People sometimes confuse OCD with a personal preference for keeping things neat, clean and organized. But in reality, OCD is a brain-based condition that doesn't leave room for choice.    Kids with OCD live with unwanted (obsessive) thoughts that fill them with fear and anxiety. These thoughts trigger strong urges (compulsions) to do things they believe will protect them or someone they care about, or at least make the bad thoughts go away for a while.  A child with OCD might compulsively check doors and windows to keep loved ones safe or wash their hands again and again, convinced that dirt and germs might harm them. They might count out loud or repeat a series of words, believing that something bad will happen if they don't. Actions like these may not seem logical, but the child's brain is sending them strong signals that are virtually impossible for them to ignore.  A closer look at OCD symptoms  Concerns about OCD often begin when parents, caregivers or teachers notice that a child or teen:  Does things over and over again until they are \"just right\" Orders or arranges objects in a very specific way Questions, judges or criticizes themselves harshly Apologizes constantly or seeks reassurance  Has strong emotional reactions to small things Struggles to make choices, even minor ones  Kids with OCD may have trouble sleeping, getting ready for school and other activities on time, or completing homework and everyday chores. Older kids might stay up late, trying to finish tasks they couldn't get done earlier. These patterns can trigger family conflicts, adding to the anxiety that kids, parents and even siblings may feel.    Finding help for your child with OCD  Talk with your pediatrician if you are worried that your child might have OCD. Pediatricians are familiar with anxiety disorders in children and teens and can support you and your family in getting proper screening and care.    Your child's doctor may refer you to a developmental-behavioral health specialist who will look for specific signs that point to an OCD diagnosis.    Generally, OCD is diagnosed when:  A child cannot control their fearful thoughts and compulsive actions   They spend at least one hour a day dealing with them Repeated behaviors and rituals don't offer them pleasure or satisfaction (thought they may feel momentary relief) Symptoms are causing significant struggles  at school, home, and in the child's relationships with others How OCD is treated in children and teens Finding and treating OCD early can give your child a real advantage in learning new skills that can ease the disorder's impact on everyday life.    Many kids with OCD benefit from a form of    cognitive behavioral therapy  called exposure and response prevention (ERP). This treatment helps them face their fears without giving in to compulsive responses.    In ERP, a trained professional, such as a psychologist or social worker, may gradually expose a child to a recurring thought in a safe setting, giving them the chance to see that bad things don't happen when they don't automatically launch into their usual behaviors. Gradually, this reduces anxiety and gives kids a greater sense of control over their thoughts and actions.  A subset of children benefit from combining talk therapy with a daily medication to control symptoms and foster healthy adaptations.  Working as a family to support your child (and each other) There are many things family members can do to create a supportive environment for kids with OCD. Here are some suggestions to consider.\t   Reframe what you see.  It helps to remember that kids with OCD have imperfect control over their thoughts and actions. If family members can see fears and compulsions as OCD symptoms, rather than choices the child is making, it will be easier to avoid criticism and blame. This way, you can help your child manage their symptoms rather than hiding them out of shame or fear.   \t Address stress at the family level.  OCD symptoms get worse when overall  stress  and anxiety are high. Embracing family practices like quiet hours, regular mealtimes, soothing  bedtime routines  and other forms of self-care will benefit kids with OCD.   \t Consider creating a family contract.  This is an agreement that outlines concrete ways you can reinforce the positive skills your child learns in therapy while promoting family harmony. Having a contract can ease conflicts that may have built up over time as family routines became overly focused on a child's OCD-driven symptoms or demands. You can map out what family members will and won't do when a child is feeling anxious and ways to offer praise and encouragement for progress.   \t Find support for yourself.  Raising a child with OCD can be very challenging. This is why many parents and caregivers seek out support groups where they can speak freely about their concerns and learn what works for other families. Ask your pediatrician for resources that can help you manage your own stress level—a step that will benefit you and your child.\t   More information   \t Teen Mental Health: How to Know When Your Child Needs Help\t How to Talk About Mental Health With Your Child and Their Pediatrician\t Finding Mental Health Care for Your Child",

        "content": "​No crisis has a simple solution. When teenagers engage in extreme behaviors, parents should seek help from their pediatrician and local mental health professionals.  These behaviors could include but are not limited to: Drug dealing Violence  towards family members or others Repeatedly  running away Stealing money and possessions Sometimes, though, a teen's misconduct is so extreme or has been an ongoing problem for so long that his or her parents can no longer manage and feel they have no recourse but to order him or her out of the home. No parent takes a step like that without a good deal of agonizing and soul searching. Most do so out of the sincere belief that it is in the best interest of the family, particularly siblings, and ultimately may serve as an incentive for their child to receive the professional help he or she needs—be it  psychiatric care , a  drug-rehabilitation program  or some other form of treatment—and turn around his or her life. What Is a PINS Petition? A minor cannot simply be \"thrown out of the house.\" His or her parents would have to go to their state's family court to file what is called a  PINS (Persons in Need of Supervision) petition . In some states, it may be known as a  CHINS (Children in Need of Supervision) petition .  The process may vary somewhat from one state to another. Typically, before filing, the parents and child must meet with a representative of a government social-service agency, who attempts to resolve the family crisis and keep the case out of court. This step, called diversion, can last ninety days. If reconciliation proves unsuccessful, the parents may then file the petition asking the court to order supervision or treatment for the child. (Legal guardians, school districts or social-service agencies charged with looking after a child may also file a PINS petition.) The court will appoint an attorney for the young person and for the parents as well, if they cannot afford one. While the case is under consideration, the teen will continue to live with his or her parents, unless the court decides that is an unwise arrangement. In that event, the teen may be released to the temporary care of a relative, foster care, or possibly a group home. A hearing is then held. The family may place the teen in either a treatment facility or in foster care. What Is Emancipation? Teenagers are not without legal rights. A teen who wishes to live on his or her own legally, without running away from home, can appeal to the family court for a  declaration of emancipation . Emancipation grants many rights of adulthood to teens who are approved by the court.  The criteria for emancipation varies according to jurisdiction. Most states do not allow those under eighteen to initiate such a contract, but in some, children as young as age fourteen may seek legal independence. Having graduated from high school may qualify a minor for emancipation, depending upon where he or she lives. Other criteria frequently includes marriage, parenthood or enlistment in the armed forces. Emancipation is also sometimes granted if the parents give their permission. Parents can remain involved with emancipated teens pending court approval.  Teenagers and the Juvenile Justice System In order to be prosecuted for a crime, a person has to be deemed an independent adult. If a person commits a crime while still a dependent minor, then it is considered not a criminal act but a  delinquent act . Accordingly, the case is heard in family court or juvenile court rather than in criminal court. Exceptions may be made, however, for minors who have perpetrated particularly serious or violent crimes, called  designated felonies . They may be treated as juvenile offenders in a criminal court, although the criminal court may return the case to family court. The process is similar to that of filing for a PINS petition. The teen is entitled to legal representation, and if he or she cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed by the court. An initial hearing is held to determine whether or not the teenager should be released to his or her parents' custody and allowed to go home. With minor or first-time offenses, that's usually what happens. But if the teen is felt to be a danger to the community or unlikely to return to court, he or she can be detained in a locked or unlocked facility until his or her day in court. A minor found guilty of a delinquent act may be sent to a detention center, a shelter, even a boot camp. But the growing trend is to place teenagers in the least restrictive environment possible, such as a non-secured group home. Ideally, the teen can eventually come back home and return to school. The goal of the court is not to punish, it's to rehabilitate and create a productive adult capable of functioning in society. A delinquent act does not become part of a minor's criminal record; a designated felony, however, does.

Panic attacks may be precipitated by specific events, but they can also come crashing down without warning, even during sleep.\t The average attack lasts about five to ten minutes. “It can be very scary for kids,” says Dr. Charles Irwin. “They usually come into the emergency room terrified that either they’re going crazy or they’re having a heart attack.” Some of the features of a panic attack do in fact mimic those of a heart attack: palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, dizziness and nausea. A child having these symptoms should be evaluated carefully to determine the underlying cause.\t Many youngsters never have another panic attack, which tells us they don’t suffer from panic disorder. However, those afflicted with the condition usually develop deep-seated anxieties about when and where the next one will occur. They avoid so many places and situations, their world often becomes progressively smaller.

        "content": "By: Brooks Keeshin, MD, FAAP PTSD was once seen as something that only combat veterans and war refugees might struggle with. But new research shows that people of all ages can experience PTSD, even young children. Kids may develop PTSD in response to any one-time or repeated traumas that threaten their sense of safety and security. This could be a single traumatic event like a car crash or sexual assault, or a long series of traumas. Many kids develop PTSD in response to ongoing    abuse, neglect ,    violence  or conflict.  PTSD can also develop when children witness traumatic events or situations, even though they were not injured or directly involved in what happened. For example, a child who witness a shooting may show symptoms of PTSD. Here's what parents and caregivers need to know about PTSD, and what to do if you believe your child is suffering from it.    Understanding what PTSD is (and isn't)  People sometimes joke about \"having PTSD\" when they're feeling frustrated by a problem that keeps cropping up in their lives. But in reality, PTSD is a serious, life-changing condition that requires medical treatment. \t   Children who live with PTSD may struggle with the everyday rhythms of school, sports, friends, family and community. But signs and symptoms may vary, depending on the child's age.  A primary type of symptom children and adolescents may experience are memories, flashbacks or nightmares after the event. They may also become distressed emotionally and physically when they're reminded of they scary event. Kids and teens between 7 and 18 may also have flashbacks and other    adult symptoms  of PTSD. Younger children may not describe their memories, but instead might reenact trauma during playtime. For example, they may be more likely to play with fake guns after witnessing a shooting or crash their toy cars after surviving a scary accident. Of course, the way a child plays with toys does not always confirm that they have PTSD, but this is one potential sign of the disorder. What other signs suggest a child may have PTSD? Children and teens living with PTSD may suffer from several symptoms at once, including:  Disrupted sleep, often with    nightmares or night terrors Agitation, confusion, anger or irritability Sudden or extreme emotional reactions  Difficulty concentrating and thinking clearly Loss of interest in things they once loved  Return to behaviors from an earlier life stage (thumb-sucking, clinging to parents and caregivers, or needing extra help with simple tasks)  Kids with PTSD often become    hypervigilant , constantly scanning their surroundings for possible dangers. Teens may be especially prone to risky behaviors such as    substance use  or    self-harm .  What kinds of trauma can cause PTSD in children?    Children and teens can develop PTSD in the wake of experiences such as:    Serious car, train or plane accidents Being    bitten  or attacked by a dog or other animal Being diagnosed with a life-threatening health condition Invasive medical procedures, especially in children 6 and younger\t Natural disasters  such as floods, hurricanes or wildfires Man-made disasters such as    war , bombings or terrorist acts Violent personal attacks, including shootings, kidnapping or being held captive Physical or emotional abuse at home, school or in the community Rape, sexual assault or    sexual abuse Bullying or emotional abuse Getting trapped or locked in a small space Being separated from parents or caregivers without knowing what will happen next Why do some traumatized children develop PTSD and others don't? A child's risk of developing PTSD depends on several factors, including:\t The perceived seriousness of the trauma.  Children who develop PTSD after being bitten by a dog may recover more quickly than those who have been kidnapped or sexually abused. That said, each child's experience is unique, and their reactions will vary.   \t The frequency of the trauma.  Children who have been traumatized over and over again may react very differently from those who experienced a single terrifying event.   \t The child's proximity to the trauma.  Did bad things happen at home? Next door? At school? Or much farther away?   \t Relationship with the victim.  Kids who are direct victims of trauma may face much higher risks of developing PTSD than those who only witness traumatic events. However, children who see or hear painful things may feel ashamed that they couldn't do anything to stop them or help the victims. Blame, shame and guilt will be a greater burden for kids who have    witnessed violence  or abuse of a parent, sibling or close    family  member.  Can childhood PTSD show up long after a traumatic event? Yes. In fact, children may react to trauma 6 months or more after it happens—or, in the case of ongoing trauma, even years after the fact. This may reflect the brain’s effort to manage or suppress overwhelming memories and the emotions associated with them.    As they grow and develop, children may think differently about earlier experiences. For example, a 7-year-old who suffers sexual abuse but shares this with a responsible adult and receives treatment may appear to recover fully at the time. But later, as a teenager, they may recall the abuse and feel troubled in new ways—a sign that more trauma-focused therapy is needed to help them cope with new or increased trauma symptoms.  Is there a good way to explain PTSD to a very young child? Your pediatrician can help you talk with your child about their symptoms and treatment. What matters most is reassuring your child that they haven't done anything wrong. Something bad happened to them, and their brain is trying to make sense of it. Your child may feel comforted to know that their brain is working hard to help them cope. You might say, \"Our brains are really good at keeping us safe when we are in danger. But later on, when we're safe again, our minds might not fully realize that. Feeling like we're always in danger is really uncomfortable, but there are ways to help the brain work the way it did before the bad thing(s) happened.\" How can I get treatment for a child who has PTSD?  The first step is to speak with your child's pediatrician, who can link you with a trauma-informed mental health specialist in your area. Seeking a referral is important, since not all therapists specialize in treating trauma. Your child will need to be evaluated to determine if PTSD is causing their symptoms, and whether there are other issues that should be addressed. We are learning a great deal about the value of    trauma-informed care . Trauma-informed care begins with a close look at the difficult experiences a child has endured, and the way those experiences are affecting them. This helps determine the right care    team  to provide treatment and support for the child and family.    PTSD is often treated with a blend of talk therapy and social support. Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) is one of the best studied and most widely available PTSD treatments for children and adolescents. In rare circumstances, medications might be prescribed, usually to help with PTSD-related sleep problems that therapy does not seem to resolve. Are there other ways to help my child recover from PTSD?  The love and care you show your child while they work their way through treatment will make a healing difference. Here are a few tips to follow and share with other adults in your child's life.\t Be patient.  Keep in mind that your child will not feel better right away. The brain is an incredibly complex system that requires time to recover and redirect itself after a painful event. Even more time and treatment may be needed if your child endured a long series of traumatic experiences. It's natural to want quick relief, but remind yourself that healing must happen on its own schedule.\t Be extra supportive.  Your child needs warmth and constant reassurance that you love them, trust them and will support them. Let them know you will do everything possible to help them feel safe and secure.\t Validate their feelings.  Avoid downplaying the trauma or suggesting that your child will \"get over it\" soon. Accept the emotional truth of their feelings and reactions. Kids need to know you won't judge them or resent the extra time and care they need from you right now.\t Advocate for them.  Ask friends, family members, teachers, coaches and neighbors to provide non-judgmental support. If someone is saying unkind things, don't be afraid to issue a gentle challenge: \"I know this can be confusing, but my child has been through a lot. I am asking you to show compassion, because I know you care about them.\"\t Respect their need for privacy.  Older children and teens with PTSD may feel even more reluctant to talk about their feelings than younger children. They may worry that others will see them as \"weird,\" \"creepy\" or \"crazy.\" Allow them the extra space they may need right now, while making sure they know your door is always open. If you sense your child is feeling embarrassment or shame, learn more about ways to cope with    self-stigma  and, as appropriate, share these strategies with your child.\t Offer helpful information to others.  Many of the people in your child's life may struggle to grasp what's going on. Sharing this article may help you explain how PTSD works. This can build a broader base of support for your child, so don't be afraid to offer resources to grandparents, aunties and uncles, close friends and others who are close to your child. 4 facts to remember about PTSD\t PTSD is a sign that the brain is struggling to recover from a deeply disturbing event.  Like all serious health conditions, it will take time to heal.\t There is no shame in having PTSD.  This is a serious health condition that can affect anyone who has endured trauma. Remind yourself that this is an organic brain condition, not something you have to hide from others. This will help you seek out the treatment your child needs.\t Children can and do recover.  We have effective ways to treat PTSD and more helpful knowledge is being revealed all the time. There is hope that your child will recover and thrive.\t Your pediatrician is ready to help.  So don't wait to get the resources you and your child need. Make the call today.

        "content": "Schizophrenia is a chronic mental health disorder that affects how a person feels, thinks, and behaves. The condition causes people to shift back and forth between reality and their distorted perceptions of reality. Early treatment is crucial to help kids and teens with schizophrenia do their best in school or work and in their relationships with others. At what age does schizophrenia usually develop? Schizophrenia is usually diagnosed anywhere between the late teen years and the early 30s. When teens are diagnosed before they’re 18, it’s called early-onset schizophrenia. Kids younger than 13 can develop schizophrenia too, known as childhood-onset schizophrenia, but this is extremely rare.  Schizophrenia tends to show up earlier in males than females. For males, it’s typically between ages 18 and 25 and for females, between ages 25 and 35.  Signs and symptoms of schizophrenia Early Signs When schizophrenia first starts, you may notice issues such as: Thinking Confused thoughts and speech Difficulty concentrating Strange ideas, thoughts, or statements Not being able to tell the difference between reality and television or dreams Emotions Excessive moodiness Severe depression or irritability Suicidal thoughts Lack of emotion Paralyzing anxiety and fear Extreme suspicion of others Behavior Having new problems at school Withdrawing from family and friends Increased isolation Immature behavior Noticeable changes in personality or behavior Problems with friends or peers Not keeping up with personal hygiene Later Signs As kids and teens with schizophrenia get older, their signs and symptoms become more like the ones adults experience. These may include: Psychotic Symptoms When schizophrenia cases a shift to altered reality, this is called psychosis. Periods of psychosis are also known as psychotic episodes. During a psychotic episode, a person may not be able to tell what’s real and what’s not. They may hear or see things that aren’t real (hallucinations). They might have beliefs or fears that aren’t true (delusions). Their thoughts may be disorganized, their speech may not make sense, and they may behave oddly. Kids and teens are more likely to have visual hallucinations and less likely to have delusions than adults. Negative symptoms Negative symptoms mean your child isn’t functioning normally. Examples include: Lack of motivation An obvious decline in personal hygiene Avoiding people and activities Loss of enjoyment No eye contact, no change in facial expressions, or talking in a flat tone Behavior changes You may notice differences in your child’s behavior, such as: Unpredictable behavior Difficulty completing tasks or meeting goals Unresponsive to others Moving around too much Unusual posture Cognitive symptoms Some people experience serious cognitive (thinking) symptoms, while others don’t notice them as much. These symptoms can include: Problems with concentration Attention and memory problems Difficulty processing and using information What causes schizophrenia? No one knows what causes schizophrenia. Experts believe that it develops from a combination of factors, including genetics, environment, and brain chemistry. How is schizophrenia diagnosed? Your pediatrician may be the first healthcare provider you see if you’re concerned that your child has schizophrenia. They can rule out other causes of your child’s symptoms like another mental illness, a medical condition, or drug or alcohol use.  Be aware that diagnosing schizophrenia can be a long process, especially with kids and teens. It’s important that your doctor makes absolutely sure there isn’t something else going on before making a diagnosis of schizophrenia. How is schizophrenia treated? If your child is diagnosed with schizophrenia, they’ll need treatment for the rest of their life. A child psychiatrist with experience in treating kids with schizophrenia will likely be in charge of your child’s care. There will probably be other team members too, such as nurses and therapists. Treatments for schizophrenia include: Medications Antipsychotic medications are the foundation of treatment for kids and teens with schizophrenia. These medicines are the same kinds that are used for adults with schizophrenia. They help with psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and delusions. Like all medications, the goal is to keep your child’s symptoms to a minimum using the lowest possible dose of medicine. It can take some time for your doctor to figure out which medication (or combination of medications) works best and at what dose. Your child may need other medicines as well, such as anti-anxiety medication or antidepressants. Antipsychotics have potential side effects and health risks. The side effects in children and teens can be different and more serious than they are in adults. Your doctor will monitor for side effects with certain medications. Keep track of any side effects you notice and let your doctor know if they are serious or don’t go away.  Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) Psychotherapy, also known as talk therapy, is another instrumental part of your child’s treatment. One type that’s good for treating schizophrenia is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). It can help your child cope with hallucinations and delusions, as well as work on behaviors. It also helps them learn to manage the challenges and stress that schizophrenia can create. Other psychosocial treatments There are other treatments that can improve your child’s life too. For instance, family therapy can boost your family’s communication and help you learn more about what your child is dealing with. Social skills training can help your child build relationship skills and improve their memory and attention problems. Your child may also benefit from special education services at school. This can be in the form of a 504 or an individualized education program (IEP). A federal program called  Supported Employment  can help your child get and keep a job.  Hospitalization There may be times when your child needs to be hospitalized to prevent danger to themselves or others. This can happen when their symptoms are severe and they need extra care and a safe place. Once your child’s symptoms are under better control, they can go home. You can also look into partial hospitalization or residential treatment programs. Remember Early intervention can greatly improve symptoms for a child or teen with schizophrenia. Left untreated, schizophrenia can cause serious behavioral, emotional, and health problems. If you think your child has signs or symptoms of schizophrenia, be sure to talk to your pediatrician.​",

        "content": "School avoidance (sometimes called    school refusal  or    school phobia)  occurs in as many as 5% of children. Kids may outright refuse to attend school or create reasons why they should not go. They may miss a lot of school, complaining of not feeling well, with vague, unexplainable symptoms.  Many children who try to avoid going to school have anxiety-related symptoms over which they have no conscious control. They may experience headaches, stomachaches, hyperventilation, nausea or dizziness—symptoms that happen most often on school days, and are usually absent on weekends. When these children are examined by a doctor, no  physical illnesses  are detected or diagnosed.  Here's what else to know about school avoidance and how to work with your child to help solve it. School-related anxiety Most often, school-avoiding children do not know exactly why they feel sick. They may have a hard time telling you what is causing their discomfort or upset.  When  school-related anxiety  is causing school avoidance, the symptoms may be ways to communicate emotional struggle with issues like: Fear of failure Increase in academic struggles Problems with other children (for instance, being teased) Anxieties over toileting in a public bathroom A teacher's perceived \"meanness\" Online bullying  outside of school hours Threats of physical harm (as from a school bully) or actual physical harm What to do when your child doesn't want to go to school As a first step, an examination by your child's doctor can rule out physical illness. The doctor also can help you explore the pressures your child may be feeling and create a plan to help them get back to school. Some suggestions to help your child overcome school avoidance:\t Talk with your child about the reasons why they do not want to go to school.  Consider all the possibilities and state them. Be sympathetic, supportive, and understanding of why they are upset. Brainstorm together to help your child resolve any stressful situations.\t Acknowledge that you understand your child's concerns, but insist on their immediate return to school . The longer they stay home, the more difficult their eventual return will be. Explain that they are in good health and their physical symptoms are probably from concerns they expressed to you–perhaps about grades, homework, relationships with teachers, anxieties over social pressure or fears of violence at school.  Let your child know that  school attendance  is required by law. They likely will continue to put pressure on you to let them stay home, but stay focused on getting your child back in school.\t Discuss your child's school avoidance with the school staff , including their    teacher , the principal and the    school nurse . Share with them your plans for your child's return to school and enlist their support and assistance.\t Commit to being extra firm on school mornings, when children complain most about their symptoms . Keep discussions about physical symptoms or anxieties to a minimum. For example, do not ask your child how they feel. If they are well enough to be up and around the house, then they are well enough to attend school.\t If your child's anxieties are severe, they might benefit from a step-wise return to school . For example: On day one, they might get up in the morning and get dressed. Then you might drive them by the school so they can get some feel for it before you finally return home together. On day two, your child might go to school for just half a day, or for only a class or two. On day three, your child can return for a full day of school.\t Your pediatrician might help ease your child's transition back to school  by writing a note. They can verify that your child had some symptoms that kept them from attending school, but while the symptoms may persist, they are now able to return to class.\t Request help from the school staff for assistance with your child while they are at school . A school nurse may be able to care for your child if they become symptomatic, and encourage them to return to the classroom.\t If a problem like a school bully or an unreasonable teacher is the cause of your child's anxiety,  become an advocate for your child and discuss these problems with the school staff. The teacher or principal may need to make some adjustments to relieve the pressure on your child in the classroom or on the playground. Monitor your child's online activities, as cyberbullying can happen at all hours outside the classroom and impact your child's sense of security at school.\t If your child stays home, be sure they are safe and comfortable, but do not give them any special treatment . Their symptoms should be treated with consideration and understanding. If their child's complaints warrant it, they should stay in bed. However, this should not be a holiday. There should be no screen time privileges, no special snacks, no visitors, and they should be supervised.\t Help your child develop independence by encouraging activities with other children outside the home . These can include clubs, sports activities, and socializing with friends and relatives. When to seek help While you might try to manage school refusal on your own, if your child's school avoidance lasts more than one week, you and your child may need professional assistance to deal with it. If their school refusal persists, or if they have chronic or intermittent signs of  separation difficulties  when going to school—in combination with physical symptoms that are interfering with their functioning—your doctor may recommend a consultation with a  child mental health professional .

        "content": "My child is way past toilet training, but he still soils his underwear. What should I do? \t Encopresis is one of the more frustrating disorders of middle childhood. It is the passing of stools into the underwear or pajamas, far past the time of normal toilet training. Encopresis affects about 1.5 percent of young school children and can create tremendous anxiety and embarrassment for children and their families. \t Encopresis is not a disease but rather a symptom of a complex relationship between the body and psychological/environmental stresses. Boys with encopresis outnumber girls by a ratio of six to one, although the reasons for this greater prevalence among males is not known. The condition is not related to social class, family size, the child's position in the family or the age of the parents. \t Two types\t Doctors divide cases of encopresis into two categories: primary and secondary. Children with the primary disorder have had continuous soiling throughout their lives, without any period in which they were successfully toilet trained. By contrast, children with the secondary form may develop this condition after they have been toilet trained, such as upon entering school or encountering other experiences that might be stressful. \t A frustrating condition\t Children, parents, grandparents, teachers and friends alike are often baffled by this problem. Adults sometimes assume that the child is soiling himself on purpose. While this may not be the case, children can play an active role in managing the processes involved in this disorder. \t The physical aspects of encopresis \t When encopresis occurs, it begins with stool retention in the colon. Many of these youngsters simply may not respond to the urge to defecate and thus withhold their stools. As the intestinal walls and the nerves within them stretch, nerve sensations in the area diminish. Also, the intestines progressively lose their ability to contract and squeeze the stools out of the body. Therefore, these children find it increasingly difficult to have a normal bowel movement. Most of these children are chronically constipated. \t With time, these retained stools become harder, larger and much more difficult to pass. Bowel movements then can be painful, which further discourages these children from passing the stools. \t Eventually, the sphincters (the muscular valves that normally keep stools inside the rectum) are no longer able to hold back all the stool. Large, hard feces may be retained in the colon (large intestine) and rectum, but liquid stool can begin to seep around this impacted mass, passing through the anus and staining the underwear. At other times, semiformed or partial bowel movements may pass into the underwear, and because of the decreased sensation, the child may not be aware of it. \t Possible causes \t Some youngsters are predisposed from birth to early colonic inertia - that is, a tendency toward constipation because their intestinal tracts lack full mobility. Early in life these children might have experienced constipation that required dietary and medical management. \t Some children develop constipation and encopresis because of unsuccessful toilet training as toddlers. They may have fought the toilet training process, been pushed too fast, or were punished for having accidents. Struggling with their parents for control, they may have voluntarily withheld their stools, straining to hold them as long as they could. Some children may actually have had a fear of the toilet, even thinking that they themselves might be flushed away. \t A number of other factors can also contribute to the eventual development of encopresis. Sometimes children may have pain when they have a bowel movement due to an infection or a tear near their rectum. Emotional causes can include limited access to a toilet or shyness over its use (at school, for example), or stressful life events (marital discord between parents, moves to a new neighborhood, family physical or mental illnesses or new siblings). While most children with encopresis are also constipated, some are not. These children may refuse to use the toilet and simply have normal bowel movements in their underwear or other inappropriate places. In general, these children are demonstrating their attempts to control some difficult aspects of their lives. Professional help is advisable for these children and their families. \t Many parents are astonished that their child with encopresis may not even be conscious of the odor emanating from the stool in his pants. When this odor is constant, the smelling centers of the brain may become accustomed to it, and thus the child actually is no longer aware of it. As a result, these youngsters often are surprised when a parent or someone else tells them that they have an odor. While the youngster himself may not be bothered by the smell, the people around him may not be sympathetic to his problem. \t Psychological effects\t Exasperated parents often place great pressure on their child to change this behavior  –  something the youngster may be incapable of without help from a pediatrician. While family members may have ideas on how to solve the problem, their efforts generally will fail when they do not understand the physiological mechanisms at work. \t Encopresis can lead to a struggle within the family. As parents and siblings become increasingly frustrated and angry, family activities may be curtailed or the child with encopresis may be ostracized from them. By this stage, the problem often has become a family preoccupation. \t As the child and family fruitlessly battle over the child's bowel control, the conflict may extend to other areas of the child's life. His schoolwork may suffer; his responsibilities and chores around the home may be ignored. He may also become angry, withdrawn, anxious, and depressed, often as a result of being teased and feeling humiliated. \t Management of encopresis \t Encopresis is a chronic, complex  –  but solvable  –  problem. However, the longer it exists, the more difficult it is to treat. The child should be taught how the bowel works, and that he can strengthen the muscles and nerves that control bowel function. Parents should not blame the child and make him feel guilty, since that contributes to lower self-esteem and makes him feel less competent to solve the problem. \t Parents often use a behavior modification or reward system that encourages the child's proper toilet habits. He might receive a star or sticker on a chart for each day he goes without soiling and a special small toy, for example, after a week. This approach works best for a child who truly wishes to solve the problem and is fully cooperative in that effort. \t Some youngsters have significant behavioral and emotional difficulties that interfere with the treatment program. Psychological counseling for these children helps them deal with issues like peer conflicts, academic difficulties, and low self-esteem, all of which can contribute to encopresis. \t Throughout this treatment process, parents should remind the child that there are other youngsters who have the same problem. In fact, children with the same difficulty probably attend his own school. \t Children with encopresis may have occasional relapses and failures during and after treatment; these are actually quite normal, particularly in the early phases. Ultimate success may take months or even years. \t One of the most important tasks of parents is to seek early treatment for this problem. Many mothers and fathers feel ashamed and unsupported when their child has encopresis. But parents should not just wait for it to go away. They should consult their doctor and make a persistent effort to solve the problem. If the symptoms are allowed to linger, the child's self-esteem and social confidence may be damaged even more. \t Treatment\t When encopresis is occurring in a school-age child, a physician experienced in encopresis treatment and interested in working with the child and the family should be involved. \t The treatment goals will probably be four fold: \t To establish regular bowel habits in the child\t To reduce stool retention\t To restore normal physiological control over bowel function\t To defuse conflicts and reduce concerns within the family brought on by the child's symptoms\t To accomplish these goals, attention will be focused not only on the physical basis of encopresis but also on its behavioral and psychological components and consequences. \t In the initial phase of medical care, the intestinal tract often has to be cleansed with medications. For the first week or two the child may need enemas, strong laxatives or suppositories to empty the intestinal tract so it can shrink to a more normal size. \t The maintenance phase of management involves scheduling regular times to use the toilet in conjunction with daily laxatives like mineral oil or milk of magnesia. Proper diet is important, too, with sufficient fluids and high-fiber foods. These steps will keep the stool soft and prevent constipation. When improperly supervised, these interventions have potential dangers for the health of the child and so should be done only under the supervision of the child's physician. The maintenance phase will usually last two to three months or longer.",

        "content": "By: Eric J. Sigel, MD, FAAP & Maria H. Rahmandar, MD, FAAP As children grow and become more independent, it can be more challenging for parents to know what they are thinking and feeling. When do the normal ups and downs of adolescence become something to worry about? Parents and family members can help teens cope when life feels too difficult to bear. Learn about factors that can increase your child's    risk for suicide  and explore these 12 suggestions below. These steps can help you feel better prepared to offer the caring, non-judgmental support your child needs.\t \t  1. If you see signs that your child's mental health is under threat, tune in. Maybe your child is just having a bad day. When signs of mental health troubles last for weeks, though, don't assume it's just a passing mood.  Studies show that 9 of 10 teens who died by suicide were struggling with mental health conditions such as  depression . But keep in mind: Teens who haven't been diagnosed with any mental health condition may still be at risk. In part, this is because it can be hard to pinpoint mental health issues at early ages. Occasionally teens who attempt suicide do not have underlying mental health issues. But they may give signs that they're considering ending their own lives. Your goal should be to remain calm, alert and ready to speak with your teen. Don't wait for them to come to you. You might start by saying,  \"You seem sad. I'm open to talking about this, because I love you and I care what happens to you.\"   Here  are more tips for   opening mental health conversations with your child. 2. Listen—even when your child is not talking. Don't be surprised if your teen turns away when you first raise the subject of mental health or suicide. Keep in mind that, even if your child is silent at first, actions may speak even more loudly than words. Watch for major changes in your child's sleep patterns, appetite and social activities. Self-isolation, especially for kids who usually enjoy hanging out with friends or participating in activities, can signal serious difficulties.  If your child is struggling more than usual with schoolwork, chores and other responsibilities, these are additional signs you shouldn't ignore. 3. Realize that your child might be facing suicide risks you haven't considered yet. Many parents wonder: Could my child really be at risk for suicide? Unfortunately, the answer is yes. Young people of all races, ethnicities, gender identities, sexual orientations, income levels and community backgrounds die by suicide every year.  In fact, suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people 10 to 24 years old. Here are some suicide risk factors to be aware of: Loss of a loved one to death, divorce,  deployment , deportation or  incarceration Bullying (in person or  online ) Discrimination, rejection or hostility due to  gender identity  or sexual orientation Racism , discrimination and related inequities and stressors Stigma (the belief that it's wrong or shameful to talk about mental health or suicide) Witnessing or suffering  violence  or domestic abuse Financial instability  that causes worry and insecurity Suicide in their school or friend group Major life-changing events, such as a breakup with a dating partner, a change in social connections, academic disappointment or a major health issue\t Self-harming  behavior Get more perspective on your child's specific risks    here . 4. Do not dismiss what you're seeing as \"teenage drama.\" Never assume your child is exaggerating or playing games if they say or write:\t \"I want to die.\"\t   \"I don't care anymore.\"\t \"Nothing matters.\"\t \"I wonder how many people would come to my funeral?\"\t \"Sometimes I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up.\"\t \"Everyone would be better off without me.\"\t \"You won't have to worry about me much longer.\" Many adolescents who attempt suicide will tell their parents ahead of time (though others do not). These words indicate an urgent need for help.   Don't risk being wrong about this. Take every statement about suicide seriously. 5. Respond with empathy and understanding. When your child talks or writes about suicide, you may feel shocked, hurt or angry. You may even want to deny what you're seeing or argue with your child. These feelings are natural and valid. But it's essential to focus on your child's needs first and foremost.  Your goal is to create a safe space where your teen can trust you to listen and express concern, but without judgment or blame.    Instead of reacting this way:\t \"That's a ridiculous thing to say.\"\t   \"You have a great life – why would you end it?\"\t \"You don't mean that.\"\t \"I can't believe what I'm hearing!\"   Manage your own feelings so you can respond with empathy:\t \"I'm sorry you are feeling this way—can you share a bit more?\"\t \"It sounds like you're in tremendous pain and you can't see a way out.\"\t \"Maybe you're wondering how life got this complicated and difficult.\"\t \"Right now, you're not sure of the answers to the problems you're facing.\"\t \"You must really, really be hurting inside to consider ending your life.\" 6. Get help right away. Risk for suicidal behavior is complex and not straightforward. Certainly, if you are concerned about depression, self-harm or vague references to  suicide thoughts , seek care from your primary care provider as soon as possible. You can consider reaching out to a school therapist, local mental health provider or even a national suicide hotline for guidance. If you have any concern that your teen is at more immediate risk for attempting suicide, take them to the emergency department of your local hospital or call 911. Fast action is crucial when things have reached a crisis point. Health care providers can help you and your teen create    a safety plan  that covers: Warning signs or triggers your teen feels will lead to suicidal thoughts Possible steps to help them cope when they feel triggered Sources of support: family, friends, teachers, mentors and others Emergency contacts and steps to take if things get worse 7. Remove or secure guns you have at home. Do the same with other lethal means. Firearms Half of youth suicides occur with firearms—and suicide attempts with firearms are almost always fatal. Teens and adolescents almost always use a  gun  found in their house.  By far, the safest option is to remove all guns and ammunition from your home  while your teen is struggling with thoughts of suicide. Many families turn guns over to relatives (as long as your child does not go to that relative's house), other trusted individuals, law enforcement or gun shops to help safeguard their teen during a vulnerable time. Safe home storage is the second-best option . Locking and unloading all guns, with ammunition stored and locked in a separate space, does reduce the risk of tragedy. But it only helps if your teen doesn't know the combination to the lock or where the key is hidden. Disassembling guns and storing the components separately and locked is another option. Medications & other risks Of course, guns are not the only means of suicide your child might seek out. Prescription medications and over-the-counter drugs can pose hazards during a suicidal crisis.  Keep medications locked away and, whenever possible, reduce the volume of medications on hand. Also consider buying over-the-counter medications in blister packs instead of bottles. This can help slow down access to pills. Hanging/suffocation is another leading way adolescents die by suicide. Though it is challenging to completely eliminate this possibility, secure any ropes, belts, cords or plastic bags so teens do not have access. Other potentially lethal tools and substances you should consider locking away include: Alcohol Illicit drugs Household cleaners and other poisonous products Canned dusting products Inhalants Antifreeze Knives, razors, or other weapons   The work of removing or locking up these objects and substances may seem daunting. But remember that your child's safety is at stake.  Suicide attempts are often  impulsive , and a moment of crisis can escalate very quickly. Making sure your teen cannot lay hands on lethal means at the wrong time is critical. 8. As your child enters treatment, focus on creating hope. Your child's care team will likely recommend a combination of steps to reduce mental health symptoms and thoughts of suicide. Medications, talk therapy and stress-reducing techniques such as yoga, meditation or journaling may be part of the plan. Provide realistic reassurance for your child along the way. Remind them (and yourself) that difficult times don't last forever. People do feel better when they receive effective treatment and support.   If your child expresses feelings of stigma or shame, you can remind them that 1 in 5 people have mental health symptoms at some point in their lives.   Mental health is part of total health—and seeking help is a sign of self-respect and maturity. 9. Encourage them to see family and friends, and keep an eye on social media. Your child may feel reluctant to spend time with other people. However, you can explain that social support, when they are ready, may help them feel better.  Although more quiet time might be needed at first, gentle encouragement to hang out with family, friends and neighbors will be helpful. Avoid power struggles around specific events or invitations, since your goal is to respect your child's needs and minimize stress. Social media  may be the primary way some adolescents engage with their friends. It can be a point of connection and support, but at the same time, social media can be a source of bullying and triggers. Encourage an open dialogue around social media use and ask how your adolescent feels after using social media. Consider making a  Family Media Plan . 10. Encourage sleep and exercise. Sleep changes can be warning signs before suicidal thoughts. In addition, sleep is important for baseline mental health. Encourage  healthy sleep habits .\t Physical activity  eases mental health symptoms and supports your child's wellness plan. Whether it's getting    outside  to take a daily walk, a gym workout, an online exercise class or something else, exercise will: Elevate your teen's mood by stimulating the production of endorphins (natural substances in the brain and body that help balance out stress and manage pain). Support higher levels of serotonin, another brain-body substance that leads to positive moods and restful sleep. Offer to go with them on a walk, a bike ride, or to the gym. Experts recommend 60 minutes of physical activity per day for adolescents. Easing back into any form of exercise is fine. What matters most is that your teen enjoys this activity and feels motivated to do it regularly. 11. Encourage balance, moderation and self-care. Teens in crisis need to go easy on themselves. This means adopting a realistic pace and avoiding experiences that could prove overwhelming.   Reassure your teen that  self-care  is never a sign of weakness. Everything we do in life is affected by our health. So, giving ourselves time to heal is essential. Big tasks can be divided into smaller, more manageable ones, and gradually, as your child's confidence and strength grows, they'll feel ready to take on more. Tips to help your child develop resilience Parents and caregivers have powerful tools that can help equip children and teens with skills that help them thrive during difficult times. Go  here  to learn about 4 key building blocks of healthy mental and emotional development and ways to support them. 12. Remind each other that this will take time. You and your child will benefit from knowing that progress will come at its own pace. Setbacks may happen—they're part of the healing process, too.  Encourage your child to be patient and self-forgiving. They've been through a lot, but with the right care and support, you will both see improvement. Remember\t If your child is considering suicide, call or text  988  or chat on  988lifeline.org  right away.  The Lifeline provides 24/7, free and confidential support for people in distress, prevention and crisis resources for you or your loved ones.

In 2021, emergency departments across the U.S. noted a sharp rise in 12-to-17-year-olds needing treatment for suicidal thoughts or actions. And in a recent federal    survey,  more than 4 in 10 high school students reported feeling \"persistently sad or hopeless,\" while 1 in 5 said they'd thought about suicide.  This article is also available in other languages.    Click here to download.\t Grief , isolation and fear caused by the    COVID-19 pandemic  may have been possible causes. But experts say the pressures that can lead young people to consider suicide have been rising for years. Caring and informed family support can help kids cope when life feels overwhelming. You will feel better prepared to help your child when you know more about these suicide risk factors:\t   Previous suicide attempts Young people who have already tried to take their lives face higher risks for suicide. Risks remain high for at least one year after a suicide attempt, so follow-up care is crucial.    One study shows  that the  \t stigma and shame  people feel after trying to end their lives may drive them to try again. After a suicide attempt, research also suggests that  \t self-harm , such as cutting, places kids at higher risks for suicide in the following year. Family experiences  There are many family issues that can affect youth suicide risks. For example, research shows that when one family member dies by suicide, others in the same family are more likely to take their own lives. Kids who live with    abuse , violence, and other forms of trauma are also at greater risk of suicide. Separation from loved ones due to    death , divorce,    deployment , deportation,  incarceration  and other factors can cause mental health struggles that may contribute to suicide risks, as can the loss of stable    housing . Studies also suggest that kids who are adopted and those who have spent time in foster care are more likely to be exposed to    trauma  and adversity; this can raise their risk for suicide. Social pressures relating to sexual orientation or gender identity Young people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or    two-spirit  (LGBTQ2S+) are    4 times more likely to attempt suicide  than their straight (heterosexual or cisgender) peers. However, sexual orientation and gender identity themselves are not directly linked to suicide. Rather, youth who identify as LGBTQ2S+ may experience discrimination, hostility and rejection, which can lead to suicidal thoughts and actions. One study found that when kids experience negative family and social reactions to    coming out , this can raise suicide risks. Racism Racism, discrimination and related systemic bias are extremely harmful to mental health. Also, a history of systemic racism limits children's ability to access developmentally and culturally responsive mental health services in communities and schools. Racism and discrimination have led to significant differences in suicide risk and rates based on race and ethnicity.    One study  of Black and Latinx youth showed that even subtle discrimination is linked with suicidal thinking. As the American Psychological Association (APA) notes,    race-related stress  threatens the inner resources people need to cope with everyday life. The APA offers    tools and insights  for parents who, along with their kids, need strategies for overcoming the erosive effects of racism.   Depression Adolescents    who experience depression  are more likely to attempt suicide. Parents may notice depression symptoms such as sadness, irritability, hopelessness, boredom, and the tendency to feel overwhelmed most or all the time. But some kids are good at hiding their feelings or don't know how to share them. Since 1 in every 5 adolescents and teens will face depression at some point, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that all kids aged 12 and over be screened for depression and suicide risks in yearly health checkups. Other mental health conditions Mood disorders, eating disorders and other psychiatric conditions can increase a child's risk of suicide. For example, young people with    schizophrenia  may hear voices (auditory hallucinations) that seem to be telling them to take their own lives, even though they do not want to die. Alcohol and substance use\t Substance use  is a factor in roughly 1 in 3 youth suicides. Young people may intentionally take large doses of drugs as a way of ending their lives. Alcohol and drug use can also cause a break from reality, or psychotic episode, that causes hallucinations or delusions that lead to suicide. Behavior problems Young people who experience extreme anger or have a history of aggressive, impulsive behavior face higher suicide risks. Strong feelings themselves aren't the sole cause, since most children and teens experience intense emotions and moods. But youths who act out feelings in destructive ways may end their lives, especially if they are socially isolated, using drugs or alcohol, or consuming    media  in excessive, unhealthy ways. Knowledge of other suicides, especially close to home One study showed that when young people learn about the suicide of someone they know, they    are more likely to consider or attempt suicide . Parents should pay close attention when suicides happen, especially when losses involve family members, friends, or school peers. Children and teens may need extra support, including professional counseling, to cope with strong feelings they are experiencing. Easy access to guns\t Firearms  are the top cause of death for teens 15-19 years old who die by suicide. Even when guns are locked up, studies show that teens who live in homes with firearms are more likely to kill themselves than those in homes without guns. Teens, whose brains are still developing, tend to be more impulsive than adults. A momentary decision to attempt suicide with a gun often leaves no chance for rescue.  The safest home for children and teens is one without guns.  If guns are kept in the home, they should be stored safety: locked and unloaded, with ammunition stored separately in a locked location. Family members should make sure the child does not know the codes to the locks or the location of keys.\t   Bullying and cyberbullying Kids who are bullied―and those who bully others―face higher risks of suicidal thoughts and actions. This is true whether bullying happens face-to-face or online ( cyberbullying ) .    A 2021 study  found that adolescents who were bullied online were roughly 12 times more likely to have suicidal thoughts than peers who were not. How to provide the support young people need\t Suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people 10 to 24 years old, so families should \t   know the warning signs  and be ready to help their children.  Know that it's OK to ask about suicide.  If you are concerned about your child, ask them directly if they are thinking about suicide. Studies have shown that asking about suicide will not \"put the idea into their head.\" In fact, it could open the door to an honest conversation about their mental health.   Make sure kids know it's OK to talk about suicide.  Raise the topic in a calm, non-judgmental way to help them feel safe sharing their thoughts and feelings. Here are tips for    opening the conversation . Don't wait to seek professional help.  If you see signs that your child might be considering suicide, get in touch with your family pediatrician right away to find mental health resources and support. If you need immediate support, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1(800) 273-TALK or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting \"TALK\" to 741741 in the United States or Canada. Consider telehealth.  Your child   may find it easier to talk with health professionals from the comfort of home. For teens especially, online health appointments should take place in a private space, which may help them speak more freely.    Telehealth visits  are also a convenient way to make sure young people get the timely, ongoing support they need.\t    \t If you are unsure about what to do or need immediate support, call The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline or text 'TALK\" to 741741. Trained lifeline staff will help you figure out immediate steps to protect your child.

        "content": "By: Alcy R. Torres, MD, FAAP Tourette syndrome (TS) is a nervous system disorder. It causes people to have repetitive movements or sounds that they can't control. These are known as    tics,  and they typically start in childhood. There are two types: motor tics and vocal tics. You may feel anxious if your child is diagnosed with Tourette syndrome. That's completely understandable. Educating yourself about this condition can go a long way in lessening your fears.   How did Tourette syndrome get its name?\t Tourette  is simply the last name of a French doctor who is credited with discovering the condition. In 1885, Gilles de la Tourette reported nine patients with the classic symptoms of this disorder. The condition was then named after him.   What are tics? Tourette syndrome is a type of    tic disorder . Tics can be short, fast, sudden or come in clusters. They can also vary in number, frequency, type, or severity. They can even disappear for weeks or months at a time. We often see Tourette syndrome portrayed in the media as people blurting out swear words. However, cursing and other outburts happen in less than 15% of patients. Usually, tics start gradually. In fact, your child may have had them for a long time before you notice. Sometimes tics are so mild, they're only found when a child is seen for other medical issues. Examples of motor tics: Eye blinking Head jerking Facial grimacing Eye movements Mouth opening Shoulder shrugging Knuckle cracking  Abdominal wall jerks Little jumps while walking Examples of verbal tics:  Sniffling Sneezing Throat clearing Barking and other animal sounds Squeaking Snorting Repeating words or phrases Uncontrollable swearing Examples of unusual tics: Arching Vomiting Ear movements Swallowing air Movements of the soft palate (in the back of the throat) Blocking tics such as freezing, fixed staring and certain postures that aren't associated with another condition Tics are categorized as either simple or complex:  \t Simple tics:  These tics only involve certain muscle groups in the body. They can be motor or vocal tics. For instance, kids might shrug their shoulders (motor) or grunt (vocal).\t Complex tics:  These tics often involve several groups of muscles. Examples of complex tics are jumping or twisting (motor) and repeating words or phrases (vocal). Sometimes they're a combination of motor and verbal tics. Tics typically get worse when your child is anxious, stressed, excited, tired or angry. It's not common, but tics can also happen while your child is sleeping. Keep in mind that tics are usually temporary and mild. Some kids feel they can briefly control their tics. But the urge only grows until it finally explodes. The tic has to be released. When your child is focusing their attention on something else, their tics may improve. It might be tempting, but don't ask your child to stop their tic behaviors. This just creates more tension for them and can actually make the tics worse.  It's best not to point out or comment on your child's tics either. This might make them more self-conscious, which could also make the tics worse. Instead, work at making your child's environment a place where their tics are seen as natural and normal. How is Tourette syndrome diagnosed? There are no specific tests to diagnose TS. This includes laboratory tests such as blood tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or electroencephalogram (EEG). But sometimes these tests may be used to rule out other conditions that may be causing your child's symptoms. Healthcare professionals use the    Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition  (DSM-5) to help diagnose TS.  Here are the symptoms a child must have for a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome: Multiple motor tics and vocal tics, though they might not always happen at the same time Tics that happen any times a day (usually in clusters), nearly every day, or off and on, for at least a year Tics that began before age 18 years Symptoms that aren't from taking other drugs or having another medical condition such as    seizures ,    Huntington's disease , or post-viral encephalitis Tourette syndrome is usually mild. Serious comorbidities (additional health conditions), complications and other related problems are rare.   What causes Tourette syndrome? No one knows exactly what causes Tourette syndrome. Experts think it's a combination of factors, including:   Genetics Environment An imbalance in brain chemicals called neurotransmitters Tourette syndrome usually starts between the ages of 5 and 10 years. However, it can affect infants and adults too. It's three to five times more common in boys than girls. Boys are also four times more likely to develop TS if their father has it. Studies show TS affects 6% to 12% of people in all races and ethnic groups. It's more common in people with  autism spectrum disorder  and  Fragile X syndrome . Many children with Tourette syndrome have other behavioral conditions too, including:   Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) Anxiety Depression Learning problems Behavioral problems Sleep disorders Tourette syndrome treatment There is no cure for Tourette syndrome. But many kids don't need treatment at all. Your child's symptoms only need to be treated if they're interfering with life.   If the tics affect their schoolwork, their social life or their behavior, for example, there are some treatment options that may help. Cognitive behavioral intervention & talk therapy The first line of treatment is a therapy called cognitive behavioral intervention for tics. This therapy is highly effective. But it isn't always easy to get because there aren't many psychologists trained in it. Regular talk therapy can help your child learn to relax and cope with stress. If your child has other behavioral conditions, therapy can help with these as well. Medication & other potential treatment options Medications can't completely get rid of Tourette syndrome symptoms.There are many different drugs used to treat tics. Your doctor will decide which is best for your child based on their other health conditions, such as depression or ADHD, and their age. Some of the medications that may be used to treat tics include: Clonidine Guanfacine Clonazepam Baclofen Topiramate Levetiracetam Pimozide Tetrabenazine Fluphenazine Risperidone Aripiprazole Olanzapine Haloperidol Ziprasidone Quetiapine Sulpiride Tiapride Pergolide Cannabis Botulinum toxin injections\t Deep brain stimulation  is an option for severe tics that don't respond to other treatments. More research needs to be done on how effective and safe DBS is for children with Tourette syndrome. What is the outlook for children with Tourette syndrome? In general, there's not much to fear when it comes to Tourette syndrome. Children with this disorder can live productive lives. They have a normal life expectancy.  About 30% of children with Tourette syndrome get better in adolescence or early adulthood. Another 30% carry their tics over into adulthood. Only a third get worse. But from those, just 2% to 5% need significant support in life. More information\t Tourette Association of America About Dr. Torres\t   Alcy R.

        "content": "​Eating disorders are real, treatable diseases. They frequently coexist with other illnesses such as  depression ,  substance use , or  anxiety disorders . Psychological and medicinal treatments are effective for many eating disorders. The earlier eating disorders are diagnosed and treated, the better the chances are for recovery. How are eating disorders treated? Typical treatment goals include restoring adequate nutrition, bringing weight to a healthy level, reducing excessive exercise, and stopping binging and purging behaviors. Treatment plans often are tailored to individual needs and may include one or more of the following: Psychotherapy Medical care and monitoring Nutritional counseling Medications   Some patients also may need to be hospitalized to treat problems caused by malnutrition or to ensure they eat enough if they are very underweight. Complete recovery is possible. About psychotherapies: Specific forms of psychotherapy, or talk therapy—including a family-based therapy and cognitive behavioral approaches—have been shown to be useful for treating specific eating disorders.  The Maudsley approach, for example, where parents of teens with  anorexia nervosa  assume responsibility for feeding their child, appears to be very effective in helping teens gain weight and improve eating habits and moods. Others may undergo  cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)  to reduce or eliminate binge-eating and purging behaviors. CBT helps a child learn how to identify distorted or unhelpful thinking patterns and recognize and change inaccurate beliefs. About medications: Medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, or mood stabilizers approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may also be helpful for treating eating disorders and other co-occurring illnesses such as anxiety or depression. Check the  FDA website  for the latest information on warnings, patient medication guides, or newly approved medications. What is being done to better understand and treat eating disorders? Researchers are finding that eating disorders are caused by a complex interaction of genetic, biological, psychological, and social factors. But many questions still need answers. Researchers are studying questions about genetics, brain function, and behavior to better understand and control eating disorders. Neuroimaging and genetic studies may also provide clues for how each person may respond to specific treatments. Genetics:  Mental health researchers are studying the various combinations of genes to determine if any DNA variations are associated with the  risk of developing a mental disorder .  Neuroimaging:  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), for example, may also lead to a better understanding of eating disorders. Neuroimaging already is used to identify abnormal brain activity in patients with schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression. It may help researchers better understand how people with eating disorders process information, regardless of whether they have recovered or are still in the throes of their illness.  Behavioral or psychological research:  Few studies of treatments for eating disorders have been conducted in the past due to the difficulty of this research. New studies currently underway, however, are aiming to remedy the lack of information available about treatment.

        "content": "By: Alia McKean, DO, MPH & Maria H. Rahmandar, MD, FAAP  If the child you love is hurting so badly they're harming themselves, you probably feel the pain, too. Parents and caregivers may feel confused, angry and helpless when they see signs that their child or teen is engaging in  self-harm . They realize their child needs immediate help, but many have no idea where to begin. When families bring up concerns about self-injury to their pediatrician, it provides the opportunity to talk openly about their child's situation and work out solutions together. Here are insights that address commonly held fears and misconceptions, along with ways you can support your child. \t   What is self-harm? Self-harm—also known as self-injury, self-mutilation or self-abuse—happens when people hurt themselves on purpose without intending to kill themselves. Medical experts often refer to cutting and other forms of self-harm as non-suicidal self-injury, or NSSI.  If my child is self-harming, does it mean they are thinking about suicide? Just because a child or adolescent starts engaging in self-harm, it does not automatically mean that they are having thoughts of suicide or hoping to die. However, newer studies show that when NSSI goes on for long periods, kids and teens face higher risks for suicidal thinking and actions. So parents and caregivers should take immediate steps when they believe their children are self-harming.  Are there myths about self-harm I should know about? Here's a partial list of misconceptions that pediatricians hear:  Cutting is the only form of self-injury to worry about. Self-harm is usually due to suicidal thoughts. Kids or teens who self-injure are just seeking attention or being dramatic. Girls are the only ones who self-harm. If I ask my child about self-harm, they might be tempted to try it. Kids and teens grow out of self-injuring behaviors so what is the point in treatment? Cutting: signs to look out for The most common form of NSSI is skin cutting, so you might see cuts or scars on your child's hands, wrists, stomach, legs or other areas of their body. Kids may inflict deep gashes or make dozens of smaller cuts in one spot. It is important to remember, though, that kids often hide their injuries by wearing lots of jewelry or long sleeves (even in hot weather), so the scars and cuts may not be visible or readily apparent.  Other subtle signs to look out for might include symptoms of    depression  (such as having overwhelming feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness, sleep disturbances, and low energy levels). This is because kids who have depression are at higher risk of engaging in NSSI.\t   Parents, share this video on the AAP YouTube    channel  with your teen: \" What can I do if my friend is cutting themself? \"\t   Other forms of self-harm Other forms of self-injury include head-banging, burns, hair-pulling, or excessive scratching of the skin to the point of drawing blood. Some kids punch themselves, insert objects into body openings, drink harmful substances such as bleach or detergent, or attempt to break their bones on purpose. In some cases, kids or teens may only engage in self-harm one time, but those who continue engaging in NSSI often hurt themselves in more than one way.  What causes kids to hurt themselves like this?  There is no single clear cause. However, young people who self-harm often feel overwhelming emotional pain. Others say they feel lonely, worthless or empty inside and will do anything to feel better, if only for a moment. Still others report feeling overstimulated, misunderstood or fearful of close relationships. Some feel overwhelmed by school and family responsibilities, or want to punish themselves for something bad they believe they've done.  Self-harm can also be a way for kids to take control of their bodies when they feel a lack of control over other things—or when other aspects of their lives seem unmanageable. How can something so painful actually relieve pain? We know that when human bodies are injured, certain chemicals are released by the brain to help us cope with the trauma. This rapid burst of endorphins and other natural painkillers may offer a momentary escape from the struggles a child can't seem to handle any other way. Are there any patterns of self-harm related to gender?  Female youth who self-harm are more likely to cut, while male youth are likelier to hit themselves. However, kids of all genders engage in NSSI, including males and children who identify as    non-binary or transgender .  Do kids who self-injure face higher risks for suicide?  Most self-harm comes from a momentary need to escape, not a wish to die. However, newer research suggests that adolescents who have trouble quitting NSSI face much higher rates of experiencing suicidal thoughts and dying by suicide than their peers who do not engage in self-harm. Native American and Native Alaskan youth are at particularly high risk.  How can I tell the difference between NSSI and suicidal behavior?  When in doubt, get help. Reach out to your child's pediatrician, therapist or the nearest emergency room. Medical and mental health professionals can get more information and provide guidance on next steps to keep your child safe and healthy. What ages are at highest risk for engaging in self-harm? Self-harm behaviors are most common among teenagers. Fortunately, most youth who do repeatedly self-harm stop after their teenage years. Is NSSI a sign of other mental health problems? Kids and teens who experience depression,    anxiety , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), eating disorders, substance use disorders, personality disorders and other mental health conditions are at higher risk of engaging in self-harm. Looking for and treating both the mental health condition and the self-injury is important.  How can I help my child?\t Have the    conversation .  Don't be afraid to ask kids if they're engaging in NSSI or know others who are. Take a non-judgmental position, listening more than you speak. It's OK to admit that the subject is tough for you, but express your love and concern: \"This is hard for me to even think about because I care about you and want you to be healthy and safe, always.\"\t Be prepared for strong reactions.  Because people who practice NSSI often deny it (and try to hide the evidence), your child might be upset or refuse to talk. In a calmer moment, tell your child that you're worried they might be self-harming and plan to talk with their doctor about it. Encourage them to be there for this conversation, but even if they won't go with you, make the appointment.\t Trust your pediatrician . Doctors who focus on child health often know about NSSI, from treating kids and families who've been in a similar position. You should not be shamed or blamed for your child's struggles. Allow private,    one-on-one time  for you child with their pediatrician so they can discuss concerns together. Your pediatrician can work with you and your child to create a care plan geared to your child's needs, which might include talk therapy, stress reduction techniques, medication or other steps that have been shown to help others.\t Make your home environment safer . If your child is self-harming, you can help by removing hazards such as sharp knives, razors, poisons, weapons and more from your space. Though it can be difficult to remove all items all the time, it is especially important if your child lets you know they are having thoughts or urges to self-harm, or during difficult, stressful periods that could trigger these thoughts or urges. It is also important to keep  firearms  inaccessible and all  medications  locked away, especially if your child is having suicidal thoughts. Talk with your pediatrician or mental health provider about establishing a  suicide prevention  \"safety plan.\" This will include practical ways to reorganize your home and get emergency care in any crisis.\t Change the way you think about  social media .  While digital channels may not be a direct cause of NSSI, excessive screen time can lead to poor sleep and exaggerated feelings of envy, isolation, fear and self-rejection. These issues may feed the powerful emotions that prompt some kids to self-injure, so it's worth the time to establish a healthy    family media plan . Your own digital habits matter, too. One study showed that adolescents living with depression reported that their parents spent up to    8 hours a day  on social media. This doesn't mean that parents are to blame for making their children sick, but this pattern can block opportunities for conversation and emotional closeness, which generally reduce a child's risks for depression and anxiety.\t Prioritize family mental health & relationships . If your family faces consistently high levels of stress, take time to consider how you can turn this around. Young people need to know they can ask for downtime without guilt, and that  self-care  is a priority above mountains of schoolwork and extracurricular activities. Some children and their family members are at higher risk of mental health challenges due to    trauma , violence, unstable family dynamics and poverty that are part of their everyday lives. A  supportive parent-child relationship  can serve as a powerful buffer. Talk with your pediatrician about other ways that may help reduce stress and build    resiliency  for kids exposed to    adversity .\t Share what you know.  Your child's well-being depends on the support of family, teachers, coaches and many others, so don't keep their struggles a secret and share what your child allows or what you think is important. If you're wondering how to disclose your child's NSSI in a way that respects their privacy as much as possible, ask your pediatrician for guidance. You can help educate others by sharing    this infographic  or the article you're reading right now. The Mighty, an online network of peers living with chronic health issues, offers    a helpful primer, too. Remember Self-harm doesn't mean your child or teen wants to die—and it does NOT make you a bad parent. As with any health issue, you can help your child recover by expressing hope, embracing    treatment , and making sure they feel your loving, unconditional  support .

        "content": "As winter approaches, some of us may experience the “winter blues” – feeling sad from shortening days, climbing into bed earlier and resenting waking up on dark mornings. That’s different than Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a term used to describe a type of depression that follows a seasonal pattern. The most common form of SAD occurs in winter, although some people do experience symptoms during spring and summer. And while SAD is often talked about in terms of adults, children and adolescents are not necessarily immune.  Who is at risk for SAD? SAD usually develops in a person's early 20s but can occur in older children and teens. The risk for the disorder decreases as you get older. SAD is diagnosed most often in young women, but men who have SAD may suffer more severe symptoms. People with a family history of SAD or those who live in northern latitudes where daylight hours during winter are shorter are at a higher risk for developing SAD. Symptoms of SAD When experiencing SAD, a person may withdraw socially and no longer enjoy things that used to be fun. It's as if a person's batteries have just run down. crave comfort foods, including simple carbs such as pasta, breads, and sugar. With excess unhealthy calories and a lack of  fresh fruits , vegetables, and whole grains, fatigue often sets in, leading to increased sleepiness and weight gain. feel  anxious , irritable, have trouble sleeping, or decreased appetite.  These symptoms are more common with the spring/summer form of SAD.  ​No Known Cause​ Researchers have not determined what causes SAD. There is some evidence pointing to a disruption of a person's \"circadian rhythm\" — the body's natural cycle of  sleeping  and waking. As the days shorten, the decreasing amount of light can throw off the body's natural clock, triggering depression. Sunlight also plays a role in the brain's production of  melatonin  and serotonin. During winter, your body produces more melatonin (which encourages sleep) and less serotonin (which fights depression). Researchers do not know why some people are more susceptible to SAD than others. In general, SAD is a better-recognized disorder in adults because so many children's mental health disorders emerge over time. Diagnosing SAD in a child is not easy, because determining the pattern of depression takes time. A doctor will typically attempt to determine whether a child is suffering from depression or anxiety first, then look at the pattern over time.  The diagnosis of SAD is made only if a person meets criteria for a diagnosis of depression and if a seasonal pattern of symptoms has been present for at least 2 years. In order to diagnose SAD, doctors need to perform a medical exam to rule out other possible causes of the symptoms. They may also administer questionnaires to determine mood and look for seasonal patterns. Treating SAD\t   Several effective treatments can help ease the symptoms of SAD, including: \t   Opening the window  shades  in your home. Simply bringing more sunlight into your life can treat mild cases. \t Spending time outdoors  every day, even on cloudy days. \t Exercising regularly  and                           eating a  healthy diet, one low in carbohydrates and high in vegetables, fruit, and whole grains.\t Using a \"dawn simulator ,\" which gradually turns on the bedroom light, tricking the body into thinking it's an earlier sunrise.\t Planning a mid-winter family  vacation to a sunny climate. \t Light  therapy  -  sitting in front of a strong light box or wearing light visors, with UV rays filtered out. However, light therapy may have risks when used for children. Talk to your child's doctor before considering this treatment option.\t   If none of these treatments work,  prescription antidepressants​  may help regulate the balance of serotonin and other neurotransmitters that affect mood. Antidepressants, however, come with a \"black box\" warning about the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Parents with children on antidepressants need to be vigilant in watching for agitation, anxiety, or insomnia and make sure they continue to see their physician on a regular basis.    ​Working through it together Whether noticing symptoms of SAD in yourself or in your child, take it seriously. Treating this disorder early and diligently can turn the dark days of winter into a pleasant time of togetherness for your family. ​ Additional information:\t Helping Children Handle Stress\t Taking a Mental Health Day Off from School: A Pediatrician-Mom's Perspective\t Just Breathe: The Importance of Meditation Breaks for Kids\t Common Medications for Psychiatric Disorders",

These symptoms are more common with the spring/summer form of SAD.  ​No Known Cause​ Researchers have not determined what causes SAD. There is some evidence pointing to a disruption of a person's \"circadian rhythm\" — the body's natural cycle of  sleeping  and waking. As the days shorten, the decreasing amount of light can throw off the body's natural clock, triggering depression. Sunlight also plays a role in the brain's production of  melatonin  and serotonin. During winter, your body produces more melatonin (which encourages sleep) and less serotonin (which fights depression). Researchers do not know why some people are more susceptible to SAD than others. In general, SAD is a better-recognized disorder in adults because so many children's mental health disorders emerge over time. Diagnosing SAD in a child is not easy, because determining the pattern of depression takes time. A doctor will typically attempt to determine whether a child is suffering from depression or anxiety first, then look at the pattern over time.  The diagnosis of SAD is made only if a person meets criteria for a diagnosis of depression and if a seasonal pattern of symptoms has been present for at least 2 years. In order to diagnose SAD, doctors need to perform a medical exam to rule out other possible causes of the symptoms. They may also administer questionnaires to determine mood and look for seasonal patterns. Treating SAD\t   Several effective treatments can help ease the symptoms of SAD, including: \t   Opening the window  shades  in your home. Simply bringing more sunlight into your life can treat mild cases. \t Spending time outdoors  every day, even on cloudy days. \t Exercising regularly  and                           eating a  healthy diet, one low in carbohydrates and high in vegetables, fruit, and whole grains.\t Using a \"dawn simulator ,\" which gradually turns on the bedroom light, tricking the body into thinking it's an earlier sunrise.\t Planning a mid-winter family  vacation to a sunny climate. \t Light  therapy  -  sitting in front of a strong light box or wearing light visors, with UV rays filtered out. However, light therapy may have risks when used for children. Talk to your child's doctor before considering this treatment option.\t   If none of these treatments work,  prescription antidepressants​  may help regulate the balance of serotonin and other neurotransmitters that affect mood. Antidepressants, however, come with a \"black box\" warning about the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Parents with children on antidepressants need to be vigilant in watching for agitation, anxiety, or insomnia and make sure they continue to see their physician on a regular basis.    ​Working through it together Whether noticing symptoms of SAD in yourself or in your child, take it seriously. Treating this disorder early and diligently can turn the dark days of winter into a pleasant time of togetherness for your family. ​ Additional information:\t Helping Children Handle Stress\t Taking a Mental Health Day Off from School: A Pediatrician-Mom's Perspective\t Just Breathe: The Importance of Meditation Breaks for Kids\t Common Medications for Psychiatric Disorders",

        "content": "​​By: Sheela N. Magge, MD, MSCE, FAAP In adulthood, metabolic syndrome—a group of at least 3 of 5 risk factors including central obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, abnormal cholesterol, and high triglycerides—predicts cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. But it turns out that deciding when a child has metabolic syndrome is more complicated, because there is not a uniform definition for metabolic syndrome in children.  The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recognizes that children are not small adults. That's why the  AAP recommends  pediatricians (and parents) focus more on the risk factors and risk factor screenings when approaching metabolic syndrome prevention in children and adolescents.  Steps to Lessen Your Kids' Chances of Developing Metabolic Syndrome Risk Factors:  Improve what your child eats and drinks.  Among the multiple dietary factors associated with obesity, lack of whole grain, and fiber intake is most strongly correlated with the development of insulin resistance. Higher consumption of  fruits and vegetables —which contribute dietary fiber as well as micronutrients—is known to reduce risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Having a diet that's high in calories and low in nutrients and consuming lots of fast food and sweetened beverages can put kids at risk for metabolic syndrome. Get enough exercise.   Physical activity  is beneficial for weight management. By taking just one of those hours spent in front of a screen each day and spending it on something that gets the blood flowing, kids can dramatically improve their blood pressure, cholesterol, and sensitivity to the effects of insulin. Monitor screen time.  The number of hours a child spends each day in front of a screen is directly related to body mass index (BMI) and calories consumed per day. The AAP discourages screen use except for video chatting before 18 to 24 months of age and recommends that pediatricians help families develop a  Family Media Use Plan  specific for each child that ensures entertainment screen time does not displace healthy behavioral factors, such as adequate sleep and physical activity. Get enough sleep.  Short  sleep duration  inversely predicts cardiometabolic risk in teens with obesity—even when controlling for degree of obesity and levels of physical activity. Some studies in adults and children have found either too much or too little sleep is problematic.   Avoid tobacco smoke exposure.  No surprise here—it's just about the worst thing people can do to their heart and lungs. Either alone or in combination with metabolic syndrome risk factors,  smoking  greatly increases your child's risk for developing heart disease. Risk Factor Screenings at Well-Child Visits: Obesity.  An annual obesity screening is recommended for all children using the BMI formula. Pediatricians can refer children with BMI at or greater than the 95th percentile for a comprehensive weight-management program (if available locally). Pediatricians with a special expertise in this area may also be able to help children within their own practice.  High blood sugar (glucose abnormalities).  The AAP recommends children 10 years or older (or pubertal) with a BMI at or greater than the 85th percentile and 2 additional risk factors be screened with a fasting glucose test every 2 years. Children found to have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus on screening can be referred to a  pediatric endocrinologist  for management and/or monitoring. High blood pressure (hypertension).  All children should be screened annually for elevated blood pressure. This can be done at your child's annual  well-child visit .  Cholesterol.  A nonfasting non-HDL cholesterol or fasting lipid screening should be performed in all children between the ages of 9 and 11 years. The AAP also recommends a fasting lipid panel in children with a BMI at or greater than the 85th percentile.  See  Cholesterol Levels in Children and Adolescents  for more information.   Treating Risk Factors:  If your child has multiple risk factors for metabolic syndrome, it does not necessarily mean that he or she will develop heart disease or diabetes, but the chances are increased—especially if the risk factors involved aren't improved or eliminated. For some kids, lifestyle changes may be enough to reduce the risk for serious disease. Remember, it's easier for kids to make better choices if they see their parents doing the same!

But what does it mean, and why is it important to your child's health? Read on for information about how BMI is calculated, what ranges pediatricians like to see in children, and why BMI — while important — can have limitations.\t   What is Body Mass Index (BMI)?\t   In simple terms, a person's Body Mass Index or BMI, is a measure of weight in relation to height. This number helps doctors understand if a person’s weight is in a category such as underweight, overweight or obese that may be putting their health at risk. \t   We know that children are constantly growing, and do so at different rates. Instead of just using the BMI number as is done with adults, we look at BMI percentiles. These measures look at a child's growth in relation to children of the same age and sex to figure out if they are within a healthy weight range.\t   How is a child's BMI calculated?\t   Your pediatrician will measure your child's height and weight with their shoes and heavy clothes off, and then calculate BMI with this formula:  \t \t \t \t  Body-Mass Index Formula\t \t \t \t   Method\t \t \t Example\t \t \t \t  1.

        "content": "By: Sandra Hassink, MD, FAAP & Sarah Hampl, MD, FAAP As a parent, you want the best possible health for your child. So does your pediatrician. When your child comes to see a pediatrician, for either a well visit or a sick one, we are always asking ourselves what we can do to keep your child healthy. An important step in understanding your child's health is checking if they have excess weight. That's because excess weight—overweight or obesity—can impact their overall health. Understanding obesity as a chronic disease In fact, we call obesity a chronic disease because it can affect every part of the body. It can even interfere with the way we feel hunger and fullness and process energy. Obesity is a disease that can be treated, much like asthma and other chronic conditions.  Childhood obesity often lasts into adulthood if it is not    treated . It can result in other diseases such as type 2    diabetes , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, high cholesterol,    high blood pressure , sleep apnea and    orthopedic  (bone and joint) problems, to name a few.\t Wha t causes childhood obesity? The causes of obesity are not limited to just individual or family factors, such as genetics,    nutrition  and    physical activity . They also involve multiple, complex situations in the wider environment that can lead to obesity. Examples include: Unjust food systems and economic factors, which can make it hard for some families to access or afford healthy food choices. Unsafe physical environments, which can limit opportunities for physical activity,    exercise  and active    play . Sources of    toxic stress  such as exposure to    racism . Toxic stress can affect the hormones that regulate weight, among other health effects.\t How is a child di agnosed with overweight or obesity? One of the measures we use to check for excess weight is the body-mass index, or    BMI . The BMI is a calculation that uses your child's height and weight and lets us know if they are in a healthy range for their age and sex. The BMI itself does not tell us about their health inside their body. However, it is an outward sign of what can be happening inside their body.  If your child's BMI is outside their healthy range, this is referred to as overweight or obesity. Your doctor will want to explore and learn more. This is because excess weight can take a toll on the body. It can affect internal organs, causing inflammation and problems with the  immune system  and body chemistry, for example. Obesity also impacts    mental health . These effects are not visible from the outside.  This is why your doctor will be asking you and your child questions about the way their body is functioning. They'll also gauge the body's health by ordering lab work and other tests. The goal of this evaluation is to make sure that your child is healthy inside. Beyond BMI: how is your child's health on the inside? We know that excess weight or high BMI is just a part of the puzzle. In some cases, children and adolescents with excess weight or higher BMIs are healthy on the inside. But the effects of excess weight or high BMI can progress, so your doctor will want to monitor these tests over time. Why it's important to treat obesity early We need to work towards a better environment where all children and families can grow up healthy. However, until we are able to create healthier environments, keep in mind that treatment for overweight and obesity can work despite unhealthy environments. Treatment of obesity and obesity-related diseases may be needed for many years. It requires an ongoing partnership with your child's doctor and attention to the disease through family-based  intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment . These can bolster your child's ability to stay healthy on the inside and address excess weight. In addition to intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment, medication and    metabolic and bariatric surgery  may be recommended in some cases.\t Focus on health—not on body appearance It is important to acknowledge the harmful effects of weight bias and stigma. There is no place for blame or guilt about body shape or size. What is important is that our bodies function in a healthy way. Blaming someone for obesity is like blaming someone for having asthma. It is not helpful, frequently harmful and gets in the way of effective treatment.  Similar to other chronic diseases, the focus of treatment for obesity should be on the overall health and quality-of-life factors important to your child and family. For example, treatment goals may include missing less school, participating in events such as walkathons and improved    self-esteem . Remember Your child’s health is important to you as parents and to your child’s pediatrician. Measuring BMI and evaluating for the health effects of obesity is part of keeping your child healthy.

        "content": "By Natalie D. Muth, MD, MPH, RDN, FAAP, FACSM Parents often feel overwhelmed by the flood of advice they get about their children's health. As a pediatrician and dietitian who is also a parent, I know how it feels — especially when it comes to helping your child be their healthiest self and preventing problems from    childhood obesity . News stories warn about the dangers of highly processed foods, sugary drinks and too much screen time on our kids. We know firsthand the challenges of raising children and teens who are mentally and physically healthy in environments that makes that exceedingly difficult. Making the healthy choice the easy choice With our  newly updated clinical    report, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) aims to mobilize and support parents, pediatricians, and communities and tackle these issues together.  We need to do this at every level, from supporting individual children and families to advocating for healthier schools, communities and policies that make the healthy choice the easy choice. Our common goal: to ensure kids have access to what they need to live healthier, more active lives.\t Why healthy living and weight is about more than nutrition and exercise Our report provides tools and resources to help optimize health regardless of a child's weight. That said, the guidance is based on the best science on strategies that can help prevent obesity at every stage, from infancy through adolescence.  It turns out, this is about much more than nutrition and physical activity. While these are key factors that govern a child's health and weight, they are among a variety of influences. Key factors that affect a child's health and weight Nutrition.  Setting   regular meal and snack times can support healthy weight. Another key: having healthful foods such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains on hand while minimizing highly processed foods and sugary drinks. We also know it helps when children learn to use cues of hunger and fullness to guide what they eat and drink, rather than other triggers such as the amount of food on their plate. Physical activity.  Kids need physical activity built into    every day —whether that's playing sports, playing    outdoors , helping with family  chores ,  walking or biking to school , engaging in physical education, taking a family walk or any other physical activity they enjoy. Sleep.  When kids (and adults) don't get  enough sleep , their bodies release stress hormones to help them get through the day. These biological patterns affect appetite and the way our bodies burn (or store) excess calories. Studies link insufficient sleep with weight gain, and sleep loss can aggravate health issues such as    diabetes . Plus, poor sleep is associated with decreased focus and attention and behavioral concerns. Healthy tech use.  This issue is closely related to sleep, since screen time before bed    disrupts sleep cycles . But it's also a factor in making time for healthy activities that get us moving. Gaming, TV, smartphones and other media devices can consume the hours our kids need for free  play , sports and socializing. Children who  eat while using screens  also risk mindless and excess food intake. Too much media use can also negatively impact mental health and well being. Emotional & social issues.  Feeling  loved , seen and appreciated are   just as central to your child's health as nutrition and exercise. The brain and the body are one system – so when kids feel safe and secure, their bodies function well. When they are threatened by hurtful issues such as    racism ,    abuse ,    bullying  or pressure to look or act a certain way (often fueled by    social media ), their health can suffer. Tackling the issues you can control: 6 practical tips for parents 1. Help kids understand what's on their plate.  Learning about good nutrition can be a family affair. Start with the easy-to-use tools at    MyPlate.gov  to get kids involved in choosing foods they enjoy that are good for them. This resource takes into account a family's culture and traditions too, giving examples of healthy meals that include familiar foods. Pair this knowledge with a team approach to choosing, planning and making food to give kids a more active role in what they eat. 2. Make      water  your drink of choice.  The healthiest beverage is plain  water . Limit access to sweet drinks including 100% fruit juice, sodas, sports drinks and fruit drinks as much as possible. Ideally, aim for one sweet drink or fewer per week (and not at all for infants and toddlers). Bonus: drinking plenty of water    cleanses your child's teeth and gums , preventing cavities now while setting the stage for lifelong dental health. 3. Limit      ultra-processed foods .  Ultra-processed foods  (think anything with a crinkly bag or long ingredient list of difficult-to-pronounce words) are everywhere. It may not be realistic to avoid them altogether. But try to limit their access when possible and help children and teens learn the benefits of eating whole foods like fruits and vegetables. You can also talk with them about the health risks of too much \"junk food,\" which generally are loaded in sugar and salt, do not increase feelings of fullness, and prompt overeating. 4. Create a      family media plan .  Kids (and grownups!) will benefit from sensible screen time limits that make room for other healthy activities. You can engage your kids in  creating a plan  for the whole family to follow. A family media plan can also help prevent media use from interfering with adequate sleep. 5. Build movement into your daily life.  In an age when we spend far    too much time sitting , it can be challenging to get up and move more. But when parents make it a priority to work movement into family routines, kids will benefit.  Organized sports aren't the only option, though they're an excellent way to build health and fitness. Families can also enjoy walking, biking, swimming, physical    chores  and active vacations that include hiking,    water sports  and more. Indoors, you can try    active gaming  or online fitness classes to strengthen muscles, build coordination and release tension. 6. Make stress management a family priority.  Just like exercise, kids will follow the example that parents set for them. If your work, school and social schedules are jammed with so many commitments that there's no room for healthy downtime, consider what you can let go. Rest and relaxation rebuild the body's systems after the challenges of a tough day or week, so reserve time for them (and encourage kids to do the same). For tips on helping tweens and teens create their own relaxation routines, check out    this article . Challenges that families can't solve alone Parents and caregivers influence a child's home environment and daily routines around mealtimes, sleep, active and screen use. But if the surrounding environment does not support these healthy routines, even the best-intentioned parent caregiver, or motivated child or adolescent faces an uphill battle. For example, it's much easier to raise a healthy, active child when: Neighborhoods  offer plenty of safe spaces where kids can run, jump, play and enjoy team sports. This includes  safe routes  to walk and ride bikes to school. Families have access to fresh, nutritious food  close to home  at prices they can afford, as well as services and resources such as cooking classes and nutrition programs. These make it easier to prepare more healthful  home-cooked  meals. School cafeteria  standards support healthy nutrition, including what is available \"a la carte.\" This helps children and adolescents choose healthier options by default. Media and screen use is in  healthy balance  and monitored by adults, with policies in place to protect children and adolescents from the negative effects of excess or inappropriate screen use. Later  school start times  are adopted in middle and high schools to support better sleep Nutrition  labels  and other policies are in place to decrease consumption and availability of foods and beverages that pose a significant health risks to kids. This includes  ultra-processed foods  and sugary drinks. At the same time, these policies can increase the availability and affordability of foods that promote health Children, adolescents, and their families do not experience racism,  toxic stress , housing or food insecurity, safety risks or other social determinants of health and well-being Most of us don't live in ideal places like this. So, we need support from schools, health care systems and the wider community to create healthier lives for our kids. How your child's doctor can support you Partnering with your child's doctor can help you create healthy sleep routines, set reasonable limits on screen time and navigate the sources of stress your child will encounter in the larger world.  For example, pediatricians and health care teams can: Learn about a family's culture, habits and routines as well as any challenges they face in adopting healthy eating, physical activity and stress management routines. Offer practical ways for parents to tackle specific issues—for example, the challenge of setting regular    family mealtimes , which have been shown to support healthy weight in kids. Understand the impact that social factors—also called    social determinants of health —might have on a family's well-being.  Show compassion and concern for individual and family needs, exploring ways that parents can care for children who face discrimination, bullying, abuse or extreme social pressures that can harm their health. Support children and families affected by    eating disorders , starting with regular screening that helps identify eating struggles early. When kids need help reaching a healthier weight, explore possible solutions with families in an open, non-judgmental way.  Work with parents and kids to create a treatment plan that emphasizes good health today while shaping skills that will benefit them long into the future.

        "content": "Most teens with obesity, especially those with more severe forms, have been working on healthy lifestyle habits for most of their lives. However, for many teens, despite years of hard work, this is still not effective in preventing the harmful health effects of obesity. For these teens,  treatment  options in addition to nutrition and exercise, such as medications or weight-loss surgery, may be considered.\t Weight-loss surgery has been shown to be safe and effective for pediatric patients who are experiencing obesity and its health consequences.  The most common weight-loss surgery in the U.S.―the gastric sleeve and gastric bypass―help people lose about 30% of their bodyweight and keep it off. Unfortunately, it is widely underutilized by those who could benefit from it most.  The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)    policy statement  and clinical practice guideline provides evidence and support for greater access for the procedure for adolescents with the condition.  At its core, severe obesity in children is what the AAP calls an \"epidemic within an epidemic.\" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)    nearly one in 5 children and adolescents  are affected by obesity; that's more than 14 million young people!  In the past, children with this condition (and their parents) were told to simply \"eat less and move more.\" However, decades of science now tells us that obesity is a biologic condition, and is driven by factors not just related to the individual and their health choices. Yes, lifestyle is important, but there are many teens who live very healthy lifestyles and still experience obesity and its consequences.    Children and teens with obesity need and deserve effective treatment options. \"Is bariatric surgery right for my child?\" This question should be the primary focus in any    shared-decision-making process ; the decision to have any surgery―at any age―should be based on the risks of the surgery itself versus the risks of not having it.   The AAP recommends a      team-based approach  to care for children with chronic conditions such as severe obesity. Thorough evaluation and thoughtful, ongoing discussions about excess weight with primary care providers, specialists and surgical teams―as well as mental health care providers and dietitians―are critical for making a shared decision on whether to have weight loss surgery. In general, surgery is recommended for pediatric patients who: have a body-mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or greater (or 120%) with additional health complications of obesity, OR have a BMI of 40 or greater (or 140%) even if they do not have other health complications.    What else to consider In addition to whether bariatric surgery is the right option for your child, other important considerations include whether this is the right time in life. There is no specific age cutoff for surgery, however we have the most scientific data on teens aged 13 and older.  Also consider whether your teen really understands the risks and benefits. This helps them to make this important decision for themselves, supported by family and their medical team.  The main reason to do surgery is to improve long-term health into adulthood―a huge benefit!\t \t \t \"As a parent, it was important for me that my daughter really 'own' this surgery. It was 'her surgery.' Forever. I think that may be the key to this entire experience. I made sure she was   ready to handle the responsibilities that came along with this surgery and educated myself so that if she slipped along her journey, I was there to help her be successful. It is imperative for parents to be educated about how the surgery actually functions. Parents have to be their child's biggest cheerleaders in this process; there is no room for doubt.\"\t ―Shannon Newsome, mom to Faith, who received bariatric surgery in high school Where to have bariatric surgery? The AAP recommends bariatric surgery be performed at centers that have extensive pediatric surgical experience and full support from pediatric specialists who can fully evaluate and care for patients with severe obesity before and after surgery. As a parent, you can start by asking your child's pediatrician if there is an accredited adolescent weight loss surgery program in the area. If pediatricians are not aware, you can search  here . When insurance is a problem   Access to weight-loss surgery is a huge barrier across the United States; insurance coverage―or lack thereof―can play a large role. One    study  found less than half (47%) of children who qualified for weight loss surgery had insurance that covered the surgery; \"Under 18 years\" was cited as the most common reason for coverage denial. This includes both private and public insurance payment types. Parents should contact their insurance representative early when considering surgery, to find out more about the qualifications and coverage prior to starting down this path.   The AAP recommends insurance companies cover bariatric surgery and all pre-operative and post-operative care. The AAP also recommends avoiding setting arbitrary age limits for coverage; rather the procedure should be considered for patients diagnosed with severe obesity.  The Obesity in Action Coalition has    great tips  on the specific exclusion and inclusion language to look for in your insurance policy. Parents can also send a copy of the AAP    policy statement  to their insurance company.  Life after weight-loss surgery  There are specific nutrition and activity recommendations that must be followed after surgery; many programs and insurance companies actually require patients to learn about these things before even being considered for the surgery. It's a big responsibility.    There is always uncertainty and variation at any age in terms of how people respond to bariatric surgery. Even patients from the same family can respond differently.  Adolescence may actually be the best time to have bariatric surgery; outcomes are encouraging.  One    study  found 95% of teens who had Type 2 diabetes saw their diabetes resolve after receiving bariatric surgery and nearly 80% normalized their high blood pressure. These turnaround rates are better than what is documented among adults. Another    study  found that up to eight years after surgery, teens typically lost about 30% of their original bodyweight and were seeing other incredible health benefits―including a    higher sense of well-being  and lower rates of depression and exclusion previously felt as a result of their weight.   \t \t \t \" Weight-loss surgery was challenging; it was not a quick fix. But it was the best decision I have ever made for myself and my health. I learned to view obesity as a medical condition, not a result of my own personal failings.

        "content": "Polycystic ovary syndrome  (PCOS) is common disorder in girls. Symptoms may include excess body hair (hirsutism), severe  acne  and  menstrual cycle problems . The excess body hair can be on the face, chin, neck, back, chest, breasts or abdomen. The menstrual cycle problems include months without any periods, heavy or long-lasting periods, or periods that happen too often.  Polycystic ovary syndrome has also been called ovarian hyperandrogenism. Many people with PCOS have overweight or obesity, but some are of normal weight or thin. Girls may have mothers, aunts, or sisters who have had irregular menstrual periods excess body hair, or infertility. Some family members may have  type 2 diabetes .  Polycystic ovary syndrome has also been called ovarian hyperandrogenism. During puberty, the androgen (male-like) hormones made in the adrenal gland cause underarm hair, pubic hair, and body odor to develop. During and after puberty, ovaries normally make 3 types of hormones:  estrogens, progesterone,  and  androgens . In PCOS, the ovaries make too many androgen hormones. The elevated androgen hormone levels can cause increased body hair growth, acne, and irregular menstrual cycles in teens and adults. What causes PCOS? The causes of PCOS are not completely known. Polycystic ovary syndrome seems to  \"run\" in families . Although the specific genes that cause PCOS are unknown, some genetic differences may increase the risk of developing PCOS. In many girls, PCOS also seems to be related to being  insulin resistant,  which means that a girl's body must make extra insulin to keep blood sugar levels in the normal range. Higher insulin levels can influence the ovaries to make too many androgen hormones. Some girls may have elevated  blood pressure , elevated blood glucose levels, or elevated blood  cholesterol  levels. How is PCOS diagnosed? No single laboratory test can accurately diagnose PCOS. The typical symptoms of PCOS include irregular menstrual periods, acne, or excess body hair on the face, chest, or abdomen. Blood tests are obtained to measure blood androgen hormone levels and to rule out other disorders with similar symptoms. For some girls, an oral glucose tolerance test is helpful to check for elevated blood glucose and insulin levels. Menstrual periods are often irregular for the first 2 to 3 years after menarche (the first menstrual period). Thus, it may be difficult to diagnosis PCOS in early adolescent girls. Nevertheless, it is important to treat the symptoms even if the diagnosis cannot be confirmed. How is PCOS treated? Treating PCOS focuses on treatment of the specific symptoms of PCOS, including acne, excess body hair, and abnormal menstrual periods.  Oral contraceptives  are pills that contain estrogen- and progesterone-type hormones and are often used to treat abnormal menstrual cycles. Other treatment options include a pill containing only progesterone, which is given for 5 to 10 days every 1 to 3 months to bring on a period; combined estrogen and progesterone patches; or an  intrauterine device . Some girls cannot use these medications because of other health conditions, so it is important to share your child's whole medical and family history with your child's doctor. Acne can be treated with medication applied to the skin, antibiotics, a pill called  spironolactone,  or oral contraceptives. Spironolactone is typically used to treat high blood pressure, but it also blocks some of the effects of androgen hormones. Pregnant women should never take spironolactone because of the possibility of birth defects in newborn boys. Removal of excess body hair involves cosmetic methods such as bleaching, waxing, shaving, electrolysis, laser hair removal, or topical depilatories. Some women develop cutaneous allergic reactions to topical depilatories. Using oral contraceptive pills and/or spironolactone can slow the rate of hair growth. A cream medication called Vaniqa® (eflornithine hydrochloride; 13.9%) can be applied twice a day to unwanted areas of hair to prevent new hair from growing. It is  usually not covered by insurance  and must be used every day, or the hair will grow back. In patients who have overweight or obesity, losing weight may decrease insulin resistance and improve the signs and symptoms of PCOS. At least 150 minutes of a physical activity that raises the heart rate every week helps for weight loss. A healthy diet without sweet drinks, such as soda and juice, and with limited concentrated carbohydrates, reduced simple sugars and processed carbohydrates, and portion control will help to achieve weight loss and decrease insulin resistance. Metformin is a medication commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. It may be used in the treatment of PCOS. It helps to reduce insulin resistance and can be associated with a small amount of weight loss. Metformin has not yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of PCOS. However, metformin is generally safe and often helps. Can girls with PCOS become pregnant? A girl with PCOS can become pregnant, even if she is not having regular periods. Any girl with PCOS who is having sexual intercourse should use  contraception  if she does not wish to become pregnant. If a woman with PCOS wants to have a child and is having difficulty becoming pregnant, many options are available to help achieve pregnancy. Some PCOS medications cannot be used during pregnancy, so discuss your plans honestly with your doctor.",

        "content": "You’ve heard the stories about the happy fat person, right? Well, as comforting as they might be, particularly if your own child is heavy, they may be more myth than reality in most children’s lives. Not only are there health costs associated with  childhood obesity , but your child’s weight problem is also intimately entangled in his emotional world. \t Social Stigma\t For children who are overweight, living with excess pounds can be heartbreaking. In its own way, the social stigma attached to being overweight can be as damaging to a child as the  physical diseases and conditions  that often accompany obesity. In a society that puts a premium on  thinness , studies show that children as young as 6 years may associate negative stereotypes with excess weight and believe that a heavy child is simply less likable.\t Self-Esteem & School Bullying \t True, some children who are overweight are very popular with their classmates, feel good about themselves, and have plenty of self confidence. But in general, if your child is obese, he is more likely to have  low self-esteem  than his thinner peers. His weak self-esteem can translate into feelings of shame about his body, and his lack of self-confidence can lead to poorer academic performance at school. You probably don’t need a detailed description of how difficult the day-to-day life of children who are overweight can sometimes be. These youngsters may be told by classmates (and even adults) that being heavy is their own fault. They might be called names. They could be subjected to  teasing and bullying . Their former friends may avoid them, and they may also have trouble making new friends. They could be the last one chosen when teams are selected in physical education classes.\t Depression \t With all of this turmoil, he may feel as though he doesn’t belong or fit in anywhere. He may see himself as different and an outcast. He’ll often feel lonely and is less likely than his peers to describe himself as popular or cool. And when this scenario becomes ingrained as part of his life—month after month, year after year—he can become sad and clinically  depressed  and withdraw into himself.\t Emotional Eating \t In an ironic twist, some children who are overweight might seek  emotional comfort in food , adding even more calories to their plates at the same time that their pediatricians and parents are urging them to eat less. Add to that the other emotional peaks and valleys of life, including the stress of  moving to a new community ,  difficulties in school , or the  death of a parent  or a  divorce , and some children routinely overindulge in food.\t Discrimination \t There are other obesity-related repercussions that continue well into adolescence and beyond. Heavy teenagers and adults might face discrimination based solely on their weight. Some research suggests that they are less likely to be  accepted for admission by a prestigious university . They may also have a reduced chance of landing good jobs than their thinner peers. Women who are overweight have a decreased likelihood of dating or finding a marriage partner. In short, when heavy children become heavy adults, they tend to earn less money and marry less often than their friends who are of average weight.",

        "content": "Pediatricians are very concerned about the growing number of children who are overweight for a number of reasons. Not surprisingly, obesity can limit a child’s physical activity on the playground and athletic field. But more worrisome, there are many health risks associated with being too heavy.\t For example, one recent report stated that among children 5 to 10 years of age with obesity, 60% already had at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease, such as  high cholesterol  levels, high triglycerides (another type of blood fat), and  high blood pressure . Cardiovascular-related conditions aren’t the only health problems associated with childhood obesity. \t Diabetes , for example, is another increasing concern among pediatricians and parents of children who are overweight. That’s because a fast-growing number of newly diagnosed cases of childhood diabetes are the so-called type 2 form of the disease.  Type 2 diabetes  used to be called adult-onset because it almost always affected adults, but now this form of diabetes is increasingly evolving into a disease of children and teenagers, as well. In fact, recent research has shown that between 25% and 60% of newly diagnosed diabetes in children is now type 2. Particularly if your child is obese and inactive, he has an increased risk of developing this form of the disease.\t To make matters worse, if your child is overweight, he is much more likely to become an adult who is overweight. The statistics are unsettling—about 20% of 4-year-olds who are obese will grow up to become adults who are obese. That figure rises to 80% among teenagers who are overweight. And once your child is an adult, he’ll be more likely to have the same obesity-related health problems from high blood pressure to joint problems, as well as a greater risk of death as his weight increases. The bottom line is that obesity can cause a lifetime of very serious health concerns.\t One other point is important to make: Some children become so obsessed with their excess pounds and have such a distorted body image that they begin to try unusual diets, skip meals, or eliminate food groups, further adding to unhealthy eating and poor nutrition. Rarely, some children can become so focused on their weight and body image that they may develop eating disorders such as  bulimia  and  anorexia​ , all because they’re trying to get their weight under control in an unhealthy way.\t Environmental Factors\t Your youngster’s day-to-day environment—at home, at school, at friends’ homes, and virtually everywhere else he spends time—can affect his risk of becoming and remaining overweight. The fast-food restaurants where he eats,  TV programs  he watches, and video games he plays can contribute to his likelihood of developing obesity. For example, the risk of being overweight is more than 4 1⁄2 times greater for children who watch more than 5 hours of TV a day, compared with children who watch no more than 2 hours a day. That’s because children are not only inactive while watching television, but they also tend to snack at the same time, often eating high-fat foods like cookies or potato chips rather than an apple or a pear. Even so, except for sleeping, most US children spend more time (outside of school hours) watching TV than participating in any other activity.",

Fortunately, there are a variety of proven treatments for overweight and obesity in children and teens. Here's what families need to know. Childhood obesity: no one-size-fits-all solution After several decades of research, we now have several good options to help children and teens with obesity. Which option is right for any individual child is based on a number of factors. These include the family's values and health goals, the child's age and health status, and the severity of the obesity. Deciding on the right treatment should be a discussion between the child, family, the primary health care provider, and sometimes a child obesity specialist.  Will my child or teen grow out of obesity? The medical studies are clear that there is no real benefit to \"watching and waiting\" to see if children will outgrow obesity. Starting treatment promptly can prevent chronic health problems such as      diabetes ,      high blood pressure  and high cholesterol and from developing.  Obesity treatment options for kids & teens Behavioral and lifestyle treatment Weight treatment always includes      behavioral and lifestyle treatment . Your doctor will talk to you about behavioral treatment options that support healthy habits. These may involve healthcare specialists, a community program or frequent visits with your doctor. However, some patients may benefit from additional treatment to reach a weight that protects them from long-term health problems.  Weight-loss medication & surgery  Weight loss medications prescribed under the supervision of a qualified professional are a powerful tool in helping to treat obesity. For adolescents more severely affected by obesity, or those who are developing chronic health problems,      weight loss surgery  is a safe and effective option.  It is important to seek out comprehensive treatment programs with experience prescribing medications and performing weight loss surgery procedures in children and teens. Medication or surgery does not replace high quality behavior and lifestyle treatment. You, your child and your child's doctor will together make the most informed decision regarding the best treatment plan for your family. What should we expect when starting obesity treatment? First, you can expect that health providers and staff will treat your child and your family with respect, not blame or stigma. Overweight and obesity and the related health conditions are not simple problems. Genes, biology, environment, governmental policies and stress all contribute to a person's tendency to gain unhealthy weight.  Also keep in mind that obesity and overweight are chronic diseases, like asthma or diabetes. This means there is no quick \"fix\" or \"cure.\" Treatments like lifestyle programs and medications will work while you are doing the treatment. However, stopping treatment often means regaining weight. You can expect the treatment will take time and will consist of multiple visits with healthcare providers and others. What are the main goals of obesity treatment? The goal of treatment for obesity and overweight is better health. The meaning of better health differs depending on the individual patient.  Better physical health, which could mean lower blood pressure, better cholesterol levels or better endurance when physically active  Improved weight, which could mean weight loss, weight maintenance or slower weight gain. Usually, doctors track some form of body mass index (BMI) for children and adolescents, but interpretation is individualized Improved quality of life: good self-esteem, ability to be physically active, to attend school and to interact with family and friends  Does obesity treatment cause eating disorders or other types of harm?  High quality obesity treatment is safe. Children and adolescents who receive obesity treatment in a supervised and structured program show less disordered eating than those who do not get treatment. In fact, high quality obesity treatment is similar in approach and content to      eating disorder treatment ; both emphasize balanced, nutritious eating and a healthy relationship with food. Remember Obesity treatment is safe and effective. Talk with your doctor about partnering on a treatment plan that is right for you and your child.

        "content": "Children with obesity have to deal with many challenges beyond pressures to lose weight. They may also be teased at school, often unmercifully, because of their body weight. Over time, this taunting can take an  emotional toll , making them feel isolated, embarrassed and  sad .  Some of these children eventually dread going to school, and are more likely to  skip going to class . According to research, youth who are teased about their body weight are also likely to avoid physical activities at school, like gym class or sports. Often, the reason is that these are settings where they feel vulnerable to teasing. In a jointly written  policy statement , the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and The Obesity Society offer guidance for pediatricians and other health care professionals about the negative consequences of such weight-based teasing and bullying. How parents & children should respond to this type of bullying Emphasize that no one deserves to be teased . Regardless of whether it is because of weight, skin color, or any other reason — bullying is never ok. Tell an adult . Encourage your child to talk to a trusted teacher or coach at school. Stay in a group . Help them to identify at least one other friend that they can be with when they walk the school hallways, sit in the cafeteria or take the bus.  As much as they possibly can, they should not react to the taunting . If the school bully sees them becoming anxious or even start to cry, the teasing may get worse. Encourage your child to maintain their composure, turn around and walk away. Talk with your child's teacher  about the bullying . They may be able to step in and put an end to it. If the teasing continues, ask the school principal or your child's school counselor to get involved. Your child may be embarrassed to have you talk to the principal, but you can't afford to let them be mistreated any further. Many schools now have anti-bullying policies, but weight-based teasing isn't always on the radar. It is generally better to let the teacher and principal handle the situation, rather than contacting the bully or the bully's parents yourself. Convince your child to try bonding more closely with the friends that they do have at school . If they hang out with a group on the playground or in the lunch room, they are less likely to be singled out for mistreatment. Don't forget about computers and phones.  Weight-based bullying through social media is very hurtful. Monitor your child's social media activity and take seriously any  cyberbullying  against your child. Find activities outside of school that your child can participate in , where they can develop a new friend group that may be less inclined to tease.  Spend time with your child and treat them as an important person . Help maintain your child's  self-esteem  by demonstrating respect and acceptance and telling them often, \"I believe in you.\"  Reinforce your child's strengths and admirable qualities  that have nothing to do with body weight.  When the bullying happens at home When evaluating the teasing your child is experiencing, don't overlook what may be going on in your own home.  Sadly, some children are teased by their own  siblings . Even some parents use negative comments about their child's weight, often with statements like, \"I'm telling you what to do—why aren't you doing it?\"  If this is happening in your home, you need to put a stop to it. Have a family discussion about it, and set some sensible ground rules for treating each other in more supportive and positive ways.

IHBLT recognizes that each child has unique needs. It aims to address those needs for the child as well as their family in a holistic way. IHBLT also provides supports to navigate common barriers to healthy active living in a way that respects a family's cultural heritage and values. Other names for IHBLT include intensive behavioral intervention or family healthy weight programs. What is the goal of IHLBT? While IHLBT works toward lowering medical risks, the primary goals are overall good health, quality of life and  self-esteem . It also promotes respect for bodies of all shapes. What to expect during IHBLT treatment program? It can be hard to lead healthy lifestyles in today's world, but studies show that IHBLT programs work. They go beyond handouts with health tips. The programs engage with your family to provide face-to-face opportunities to practice healthy behaviors. And IHLBT programs continue to help you change behavior in ways that are individualized for your family. Programs may include different specialists, like community health educators, dietitians and exercise specialists. They can take place within health care settings or community-based organizations.  You can also expect IHBLT will involve:  Non-judgmental and inclusive activities that boost your child or teen's self-esteem and that focus on health, not weight. Activities that focus on  physical activity  and healthy  nutrition . Each program has a unique way to achieve this. Some may provide in-person exercise classes or host  cooking  demonstrations.  Attention to the whole household to help your child thrive in a healthy environment. A focus on changes that families can enjoy and keep up after the program has ended.  Plenty of time! Changing routines and habits can't happen overnight, and IHBLT programs work best when they offer plenty of time—26 hours or more, over 3 to 12 months—to help families succeed. Do IHBLT programs work for kids of different ages? Yes, several decades' worth of studies show these programs work well in many age groups. Children who participate in IHLBT for at least 3 months can expect to see improvements in health, fitness, nutrition habits and quality of life. The longer children participate and the more often they attend, the better health they can expect to see. We have the most information for children older than 6, but new studies in children 2-5 years old look promising.  How do we get started in an IHBLT program?  Talk with your pediatrician to find options that work for your child and your family. Your doctor may know of a comprehensive program near you. If there are none nearby, you and your doctor can work together to address different lifestyle and behavior topics. This can be done in step-by-step at the office. Your doctor may also find other specialists nearby who can provide coordinated care.

        "content": "Childhood overweight and  obesity  is now a national health emergency. Obesity leads to shorter life spans, lower quality of life, and many numerous chronic medical problems, many of which now even begin during childhood. We now fear that the current generation of children might live shorter lives than their parents due to the  long-term effects of obesity . However, there is a lot that can be done to address and prevent obesity, and the earlier we're able to start the better. Small adjustments  (regarding our approach to food, feeding, physical activity, etc.)  in a young child could prevent many future health challenges.  That is not to say that it will be easy, as currently the healthy choice is not always the easiest one, but it is well worth it! It was previously common to think that kids might outgrow or grow into their weight, but now often than not, this is not happening. In fact, over the past two decades obesity rates have doubled in children and tripled among adolescents in the United States. Obesity affects all of our body systems and can lead to potentially serious health problems, including diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, liver failure, and more. It also can cause psychological stresses associated with children feeling different from their peers, leading to depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) believes that making small changes early on can prevent a lifetime of complications regarding childhood obesity, and that both parents and pediatricians can take steps to help children maintain and achieve a healthy weight.  Body Mass Index (BMI) Your pediatrician should monitor your child's weight and rate of weight gain from infancy onwards.  Body Mass Index (BMI)  and BMI percentile are indicators of how your pediatrician can ensure that your child is at a healthy weight for his or her age, sex, and height. A BMI at or above the 85th percentile falls into the overweight category; a BMI at or above the 95th percentile defines the obese category. These categories are basically risk categories for current and future medical problems and the higher the BMI  (above the 85th percentile),  the greater the risk.  Infant Growth Charts  The AAP recently endorsed the World Health Organization's infant  growth charts . This means that BMI can now be monitored as soon as your child is born. We definitely would not want an infant to lose weight! But, these growth charts can provide more confidence that your infant or toddler is growing well, and so may not need extra formula or supplementation. This can be particularly helpful reassurance if you are concerned that your child is fussy due to not eating enough. Some children are more prone to gain extra weight because of  family history   (which can include things like genetics, having a slower metabolism, and family customs regarding  the type and amount of food that is eaten) , but in almost all cases, making healthy food changes and increasing physical activity can help improve your child's weight.  Encourage your child to lead an active lifestyle at home, in child care settings, and in school to start them on the path to lifelong health.  Talk to your pediatrician about ways to develop healthy eating habits that can begin in infancy, such as  minimizing or eliminating juice  and offering a variety of healthy foods, especially vegetables and fruits, and continuing these habits throughout childhood.  Early on, encourage your child to eat a variety of healthy foods and allow them to decide when they are full. Don't forget that taste preferences can change over time and it can take your child ten times of trying a new food before he enjoys it.  Choose nutritious snacks for him, including vegetables, fruits, low-fat dairy foods, and whole grains. Have him sit at the table and think about turning off the TV. Studies show that children who watch too much TV are more likely to be overweight because: TV and screen time  take away from time they could be running, jumping, and interacting with other people. Kids tend to eat more when watching TV. They're often exposed to commercials, leading to cravings for unhealthy foods. Also, try to  keep mealtimes media/screen-free . With the TV off, meals can be a great time to have family conversations.  Keeping  communication channels open  with your children throughout their school years can be very protective.  Family walks and physical activity are also a great opportunity to talk with your kids.  As a parent, you have an enormous impact not only on your youngster's lifelong food choices, but also on other factors that can contribute to or prevent obesity. Consider leading by example—if you lead a healthy lifestyle, then your child is far more likely to lead one, too.

Back pain and stiffness are most often caused by a pulled muscle, a strained ligament, or bruising. Symptoms of back pain usually disappear within a week without special treatment. Possible Causes: Although regular exercise is beneficial for all children, intensive training may lead to  overuse injuries  with back pain in some young athletes. For example,  dancers  and  gymnasts , are especially prone to back pain due to overuse. On the other hand, children who are overly sedentary (i.e., don't move much) may have back pain from weak core muscles, back strain from being  overweight , or poor posture. Scoliosis  (a severe curvature of the spine) is a possible cause of back pain, especially in adolescent girls. Your pediatrician evaluates your child's posture during regular well-child visits to make sure her back is straight and she's growing normally. Spondylolysis is a weakness in the bony bridges of the vertebral bones, usually in the lower spine. It can cause low back pain aggravated by activity and is frequently accompanied by minimal or no physical findings. Radiographs may be helpful if spondylolysis is suspected. When to Call the Pediatrician:  Consult your pediatrician if your child with back pain is younger than 10 years or has: Pain that won't go away or is getting worse Fever or weight loss Difficulty in moving a limb Numbness or tingling in a limb Loss of bladder or bowel control A change in gait or posture Back pain in a young child who hasn't been injured is concerning and needs to be evaluated by your pediatrician. ​   Additional Information on HealthyChildren.org:  Lower Back Pain in Athletes Backpack Safety Preventing Overuse Injuries Prevent Urinary Tract Infections in Children",

At times, children may not have straight lower legs until they are nine or ten years old. \t Bowlegs and knock-knees usually are variations of normal, and require no treatment. Typically, a child’s legs will straighten naturally by the teen years. Bracing, corrective shoes, and exercise are rarely helpful, and may hinder a child’s physical development and cause unnecessary emotional stress. Rarely, bowlegs or knock-knees are the result of a disease. Arthritis, injury to the growth plate around the knee, infection, tumor, Blount’s disease (a growth disorder of the shinbone), and rickets all can cause changes in the curvature of the legs. \t Here are some signs that suggest a child’s bowlegs or knock-knees may be caused by a serious problem: \t The curvature is extreme. \t Only one side is affected. \t The bowlegs get worse after age two years. \t The knock-knees persist after age seven years. \t Your child also is unusually short for his age. \t If your child fits any of these descriptions, talk to your pediatrician.

        "content": "Idiopathic clubfoot is the most common serious musculoskeletal birth defect worldwide. In the United States, about one in 1,000 infants is born with a clubfoot (or clubfeet, as 40% of cases involve both feet).  Here's what parents should know about clubfoot. What does clubfoot look like? An idiopathic clubfoot has a very high arch and turns inward toward the other leg, with the toes pointed down and backwards. The foot is quite stiff. The Achilles tendon, located behind the ankle, is tight. What causes clubfoot? The cause of idiopathic clubfoot is unknown (idiopathic means cause unknown). Genetic factors likely are involved, though, since there is a tendency for clubfoot to run in families. Idiopathic clubfoot is found in babies who have no other abnormalities.  Very rarely, however, clubfoot occurs as part of a syndrome or neurologic condition such as  spina bifida . How is clubfoot diagnosed? Clubfoot may be discovered during  prenatal ultrasound , usually at around the 20th week of pregnancy.  Occasionally a foot deformity seen during an ultrasound is a harmless positional abnormality, and not a true idiopathic clubfoot. For babies born with positional abnormalities, sometimes caused by crowding in the uterus, the feet are flexible. This kind of positional abnormality is often self-correcting.  Idiopathic clubfoot is diagnosed when the foot is examined at birth and found to be quite rigid. The deformity lasts into adult life unless treated. How is clubfoot treated? Fortunately, there is a very effective treatment for clubfoot: the Ponseti method. The treatment is named for Ignatio Ponseti, MD (1914-2009), who developed the technique over a number of years at the University of Iowa. The Ponseti method has three phases, casting, minimal surgery (Achilles tenotomy), and bracing. Phases of the Ponseti method \t Phase one , the casting phase, should start soon (1-3 weeks) after birth. The casting technique is precise and should be performed by a physician (often a pediatric orthopedic surgeon) who is experienced with the Ponseti method. The casts are changed weekly until all elements of the deformity are corrected except a tight Achilles tendon. Usually, the first phase is complete after 5-7 casts.\t Phase two  is a very minor surgical procedure, an Achilles tenotomy, required in 90% of cases. The tenotomy is generally done under local anesthesia in the office. Following the tenotomy a final cast is applied and left on for three weeks.\t Phase three  is a prolonged period of bracing, full time for three months following casting and then nighttime only until the child is 4 to 5 years old. The brace is a bar with shoes or splints attached at shoulder width. The shoe or splint is turned out 60-70 degrees on the clubfoot side and 30-40 degrees on the normal side. Working with your child's doctors during the bracing It's not easy to keep an infant in a brace every night until age four years old. It is important to work closely with your child's pediatrician and pediatric orthopedic surgeon to identify and solve any barriers to bracing. In a small percentage of cases, the clubfoot deformity will come back (recur). Stopping the bracing phase too early is the most common cause of recurrence.  If the deformity comes back, the Ponseti casting is repeated and bracing started again. Occasionally, even when the bracing phase of the treatment plan is followed perfectly, the deformity will come back. If this happens, your child's pediatric orthopedic surgeon may recommend a surgical procedure called an anterior tibial tendon transfer. Beyond joint release surgery  Before the Ponseti method was accepted as the best treatment for babies with idiopathic clubfoot, pediatric orthopedic surgeons often treated clubfeet with extensive joint release surgeries. These surgeries dramatically corrected the clubfoot deformity in the short term. However, many of the children who were treated surgically developed pain and stiffness as they reached adulthood.  The anterior tibial tendon transfer that is occasionally needed to treat recurrent clubfoot deformity is considered part of the Ponseti method. It should not be confused with the joint release surgeries done in the past. It is extremely rare for a child treated with the Ponseti method to need a joint release surgery. What is the outlook for a child born with a clubfoot? The outlook for children who are born with a clubfoot and undergo Ponseti treatment, including the complete bracing phase, is excellent. They can be expected to wear normal shoes, participate in sports, and have every opportunity for a happy and productive life. More information Newborn Feet: Common Deformities",

        "content": "​​​​Babies are often born with flat feet, which may last well into their childhood. This is because children's bones and joints are flexible, causing their feet to flatten when they stand.​ ​Young babies ​also have a fat pad on the inner border of their feet that hides the arch. You still can see the arch if you lift your baby up on the tips of the toes, but it disappears when they're standing normally. The foot may also turn out, increasing the weight on the inner side and making it appear even more flat. When do children typically outgrow flat feet? Normally, flat feet disappear by age 6 as the feet become less flexible and the arches develop. Only about 1 or 2 out of every 10 children will continue to have flat feet into adulthood.  Do flat feet need to be treated? For children who do not develop an arch, treatment is not recommended unless the foot is stiff or painful. If that's the case, your child's doctor may recommend an x-ray to check if some of some of the small foot bones are fused or connected, a condition called a tarsal coalition. Shoe inserts won't help your child develop an arch, and may cause more problems than the flat feet themselves. However, certain forms of flat feet may need to be treated differently. These include: Achilles tendon: tight heel A child may have tightness of the heel cord (Achilles tendon) that limits the motion of their foot. This tightness can result in a flat foot, but it usually can be treated with special stretching exercises to lengthen the heel cord.  Tarsal coalition: rigid feet Rarely, a child will have truly rigid flat feet because of a      tarsal coalition , which can cause problems. Children with this condition have difficulty moving the foot up and down or side to side at the ankle. The rigid foot can cause pain and, if left untreated, can lead to arthritis.  This rigid type of flat foot is seldom seen in an infant or very young child. More often, rigid flat feet develop during the  teen​  years and should be evaluated by your child's pediatrician. Symptoms that should be checked by a pediatrician include:  foot pain sores or pressure areas on the inner side of the foot a stiff foot limited side-to-side foot motion limited up-and-down ankle motion Remember For further treatment you should see a      pediatric orthopedic surgeon  or podiatrist experienced in childhood foot conditions.",

Growing pains may consist of tenderness caused by  overwork during hard exercise . Children don’t feel sore while they’re having fun; only later, when the muscles relax, do the pains come on. What Parents Can Do to Help Lessen the Pain  You may not be able to prevent growing pains, but you can help your child lessen the aches. Call for periodic rest breaks during energetic play and encourage your child to take part in a variety of  sports  and activities. In this way, he’ll give different muscle groups a workout and avoid overstraining the same muscles day after day.\t A warm bath before bedtime may help soothe muscles and ease aches.\t When growing pains are bothersome, gently massage your child’s limbs.\t A dose of children’s  acetaminophen  or  ibuprofen  may be helpful.\t When to Call Your Pediatrician  Call your pediatrician if your child has any of the following symptoms: Severe pain\t Swelling that doesn’t decrease or that grows worse after 24 hours, despite first aid with rest, ice or a cool compress, compression, and elevation  (RICE) treatment\t Fever\t A persistent lump in a muscle\t Limp\t Reddening or increased warmth of the skin overlying the muscle\t Dark urine, especially after exercise (If severe enough, this may require emergency care.)",

        "content": "When children are born, adoring parents often joke about their new baby having 10 fingers and 10 toes. In reality, anything different is pretty rare (and not as bad as you might think). More common is seeing feet that point in different directions. Sometimes this is due to the baby being squished in a small space, for example. Other times it is from something that happened during the child's development or as part of a genetic condition. Causes & treatment for foot deformities in babies The two most common foot deformities in newborns are    metatarsus adductus  and calcaneovalgus. Both are from how the baby's foot was positioned and molded inside their mother. These conditions usually improve on their own without any treatment, and don't cause any long-term problems. Two other deformities, clubfoot and congenital vertical talus, look similar and may occur on one or both sides. However, these are serious congenital disorders that need prompt treatment by an experienced clinician.  Metatarsus adductus\t Metatarsus adductus  is a curve in the middle of the foot that occurs when the feet are folded inward. How crooked the foot looks is less important than whether the foot is flexible and can be straightened out if the examiner gently pushes it into a \"normal\" position.  Flexible metatarsus adductus usually improves on its own by 6-12 months old.  There aren't studies to show that stretching the foot during feedings or diaper changes helps, but it doesn't hurt and is reasonable to try.  Feet that are stiff and don't correct may benefit from casting . The need for surgery is rare, but can be done to straighten the foot if there are problems. Typically, surgery is done only if children have trouble fitting in or tolerating shoes, usually at around 3- to 4-years old.  Clubfoot Children with  clubfoot  have metatarsus adductus, but the foot is stiff and has other differences such as a high arch. Clubfoot may occur in one or both feet. It is often diagnosed before birth by prenatal ultrasound. If not, the condition is readily noted at birth as a turned-in foot that cannot be simply placed in a normal position. Some clubfeet occur as part of a broader condition, such as  spina bifida  or arthrogryposis.  The treatment of clubfoot is generally very successful if treated by the  Ponseti method  starting in the first few weeks after birth. The Ponseti method, which is the international standard of care, involves several casts, generally one week apart, followed by Achilles tenotomy (sectioning of the Achilles tendon) in the doctor's office. Then there is a brief period of more casting, followed by bracing for several years. It works very well unless families discontinue bracing too soon. When this happens, the clubfoot will return and possibly need surgery. Calcaneovalgus Calcaneovalgus foot is more or less the opposite of metatarsus adductus. The foot is pushed up and out. When the baby is born, it may be difficult to point the foot down all the way, but this improves without treatment over a couple months. It is not known if stretching helps, but it also probably doesn't hurt. So, many doctors advise doing some stretching with feeding or diaper changes.  Surgery is usually only needed if the foot was pushed up enough to bend the shin bone backwards (posteromedial bowing) which is rare. The bowing will improve over a couple years on its own, but many children will have a leg length difference that may require surgery later in life. Until then, an insert in the shoe (heel lift) or building up the outside of the shoe helps even out the difference. Congenital vertical talus Children with  congenital vertical talus  also have a foot that bent up and to the outside. Similar to clubfeet, children with congenital vertical talus have a foot that is stiff and won't correct. It is treated with surgery and casting.

        "content": "A pulled elbow (also known as nurse­maid's elbow) is a common, painful injury generally among children under four years old but occasionally older. Nursmaid's elbow occurs when the tissue of the outer part of the elbow slips between the bones of the joint. This happens be­cause the child's elbow joint is loose enough to separate slightly when their arm is pulled to full length (while being lifted, yanked, or swung by the hand or wrist, or if they fall on their outstretched arm). The nearby tissue slides into the space created by the stretching and becomes trapped after the joint returns to its normal position. A nursemaid's elbow injury usually doesn't cause swelling, but the child will complain that the elbow hurts, or cry when their arm is moved. A child will typically hold his arm close to the side, with the elbow slightly bent and the palm turned toward the body. If someone tries to straighten the elbow or turn the palm upward, the child will resist because of the pain. Treating nursemaid's elbow This injury should be treated by a pediatrician or other trained healthcare provider. Since elbow pain can also be due to a fracture, your pediatrician may need to consider this before the elbow is \"reduced\" or put back into place.  Your doctor will check the injured area for swelling and tenderness and any limitation of motion. If an injury other than nursemaid's elbow is sus­pected, X-rays may be taken. If no fracture is noted, the doctor will move and twist and flex the arm gently to release the trapped tissue and allow the elbow to return to its normal posi­tion.  Once the doctor has moved the elbow back in place, the child will generally feel immediate relief and within a few minutes should be using their arm nor­mally without any discomfort. Occa­sionally, the doctor may recommend a sling for comfort for two or three days, particularly if several hours have passed before the injury is treated suc­cessfully.  If the injury occurred sev­eral days earlier, a hard splint or cast may be used to protect the joint for one to two weeks. Persisting pain after a reduction may mean that a fracture occurred that may not have been ap­parent at the time of initial X-rays.  Prevention  Nursemaid's elbow can be prevented by not pulling or lifting your child by the hands or wrists, or swinging her by the arms. Instead, lift your child by grasping her body under the arms.",

        "content": "Children who walk with their feet turned in are described as being \"pigeon-toed\" or having \"intoeing.\" This is a very common condition that may involve one or both feet, and it occurs for a variety of reasons.    Intoeing during infancy Infants are sometimes born with their feet turning in. If this turning occurs from the front part of their foot only, it is called  metatarsus adductus . Most commonly it is due to the foot being positioned in a certain way inside the uterus before the baby is born. You can suspect that metatarsus adductus may be present if: At rest, the front portion of your infant's foot turns inward.  The outer side of the child's foot is curved like a half-moon. This condition is usually mild and will resolve before your infant's first birthday. Sometimes it is more severe, or accompanied by other foot deformities that result in a problem called  clubfoot . This condition requires a consultation with a pediatric orthopedist, and there is extremely effective nonoperative treatment with early casting or splinting.  Intoeing in later childhood When a child is intoeing during their second year, this is most likely due to inward twisting of the shinbone (tibia). This condition is called internal tibial torsion. When a child between ages 3 and 10 has intoeing, it is probably due to an inward turning of the thighbone (femur), a condition called medial femoral torsion. Both of these conditions tend to run in families.  Treatment for intoeing Some experts feel no treatment is necessary for intoeing in an infant under 6 months of age. For severe metatarsus adductus in infancy, early casting may be useful. Studies show that most infants who have metatarsus adductus in early infancy will outgrow it with no treatment necessary. If your baby's intoeing persists after 6 months, or if it is rigid and difficult to straighten out, your doctor may refer you to a pediatric orthopedist, who may recommend a series of casts applied over a period of 3 to 6 weeks. The main goal is to correct the condition before your child starts walking.  Intoeing in early childhood often corrects itself over time, and usually requires no treatment. But if your child has trouble walking, discuss the condition with your pediatrician, who may refer you to an orthopedist. In the past, a night brace (special shoes with connecting bars) was used for this problem, but it hasn't proven to be an effective treatment.  Because intoeing often corrects itself over time, it is very important to avoid nonprescribed \"treatments\" such as corrective shoes, twister cables, daytime bracing, exercises, shoe inserts, or back manipulations. These do not resolve the problem and may be harmful because they interfere with normal play or walking. Furthermore, a child wearing these braces may face unnecessary emotional strain from her peers.  That being said, if a child's intoeing remains by the age of 9 or 10 years old, surgery may be needed to correct it.

        "content": "Our spine is naturally curved in order to distribute the weight of the body. A side-view X ray of a soldier standing rigidly at attention would show the cervical spine in his neck arched slightly forward. The twelve thoracic vertebrae curve gently to the rear. Then the lumbar spine, which bears most of our upper-body weight, arches forward as it nears the pelvis. \t About one in twenty-five adolescent girls and one in two hundred teenage boys develop scoliosis. Captured on an X-ray, their spines form, to varying degrees, a more pronounced S shape. When imaged from the back, a normal spine exhibits no curvature. A youngster is said to have scoliosis if her curvature is greater than ten degrees. \t The condition can occur as a complication of polio, muscular dystrophy and other central nervous system disorders, but four in five cases among teenage girls are idiopathic—that is, of unknown cause. Very often, though, a family member will also have had scoliosis. \t Symptoms Suggestive of Scoliosis May Include: \t Conspicuous curving of the upper body \t Uneven, rounded shoulders \t Sunken chest \t Leaning to one side \t Back pain (rare) \t Scoliosis can develop quietly for months to years so it may only be picked up by the pediatrician during an examination of the teen’s back. Progression may occur quickly during the teen’s growth spurt. One in seven young people with scoliosis have such severe curvature that they require treatment. \t How Scoliosis Is Diagnosed \t Physical examination and thorough medical history \t X-rays \t How Scoliosis Is Treated \t Bracing: Many such cases never progress to the point that treatment is necessary. Follow-up visits are scheduled approximately every six months for those diagnosed with curves between fifteen and twenty degrees. \t Curvature above twenty-five degrees may call for bracing. There are two main types of orthopedic back braces. The Milwaukee brace has a neck ring and can correct curves anywhere in the spine; the thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO for short, thankfully) is for deformities involving the vertebrae of the thoracic spine and below. The device fits under the arm and wraps around the ribs, hips and lower back. \t Scoliosis patients can expect to wear the brace all but a few hours a day until their spinal bone growth is complete; usually that’s about ages seventeen to eighteen for girls, and eighteen to nineteen for boys. The braces are more cosmetically appealing than they used to be and can be hidden easily under clothing. Having to wear an orthopedic brace interferes only minimally with physical activity. Only contact sports and trampolining are off-limits for the time being. \t Surgery: Posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation, the operation to surgically correct scoliosis, is typically recommended when the spine’s curvature is fifty degrees or more. The surgical procedure fuses the affected vertebrae using metal rods and screws to stabilize that part of the spine until it has fused together completely. On average, this takes about twelve months. Although teenagers who have the surgery still face some restrictions on physical activity, they can say good-bye to the brace. \t Helping Teens Help Themselves \t Only about 50 percent of young scoliosis patients wear their braces. Parents need to convey the importance of complying with the doctor’s instructions. At the same time, they should be sensitive to the tremendous impact the condition can inflict on a teenager’s body image, which at this age is inextricably entwined with self-identity and self-confidence. You might want to consider asking your pediatrician or orthopedist for a referral to a mental-health professional experienced in counseling children with chronic medical problems. A patient support group, like those run by the Scoliosis Association may also be helpful.",

        "content": "I think my child has sprained her ankle. How can I tell for sure?\t Sprains are injuries to the ligaments that connect bones to one another. A sprain occurs when a ligament is stretched excessively or torn. Sprains are less common in young children, because their ligaments are usually stronger than the growing bones and cartilage to which they are attached. Therefore, the growing part of the bone might separate or tear away before the ligament is injured.   \t Types of Sprains  \t In young children, the ankle is the most commonly sprained joint, followed by the knee and wrist. In a mild sprain (grade 1), the ligament simply is overstretched. More severe sprains can involve partial tearing of the ligament (grade 2), or complete tearing (grade 3).   \t Signs and Symptoms  \t The signs and symptoms of sprains in young children can be quite similar to those for fracture and include the following:   \t pain \t swelling around the joint \t inability to walk, bear weight, or use the joint  \t When To Call The Pediatrician  \t Call your child’s pediatrician if your child has a joint injury and is unable to bear weight or has excessive swelling or pain. Often the doctor will want to examine the child. In some instances, special X-rays may be ordered to rule out a fracture or a break. If there is a fracture or a break, your pediatrician may consult with or refer you to an  orthopedist  or  sports medicine specialist . \t Treatment  \t When a sprain is diagnosed, treatment usually involves compression using an elastic bandage or immobilization with a splint. A walking cast may be necessary if the ankle or foot injury has been severe.   \t Most grade 1 sprains will heal within two weeks without subsequent complications. Your child’s physician should be called any time a joint injury fails to heal or swelling recurs. Ignoring these signs could result in more severe damage to the joint and long-term disability.",

        "content": "My son seems to be limping. Should I call my pediatrician? \t Limping can be caused by something as simple as a pebble in her shoe, a blister on her foot, or a pulled muscle. But a limp also can be a sign of more serious trouble, such as a broken bone, infection, or a pulled muscle. For that reason, it’s important to have your pediatrician examine a child with a limp to make sure that no serious problems exist. \t Some children limp when they first learn how to walk. Early limping can be caused by neurological damage. But any limp around the time your child begins to walk needs to be investigated as soon as possible, since the longer it goes untreated, the more difficult it may be to correct. Once walking is well established, significant sudden limping usually indicates one of several conditions: \t A “toddler” fracture\t Hip injury or inflammation (synovitis)\t Previously undiagnosed developmental dysplasia (abnormal development) of the hip (DDH)\t Infection in the bone or joint\t Kohler’s disease (loss of blood supply to a bone in the foot)\t Juvenile idiopathic arthritis\t Fractures \t A \"toddler\" fracture is a spiral fracture of the tibia (one of the leg bones that extends from the knee to the ankle). It can occur with minor accidents such as when children trip, jump, or fall, or when they go down a slide in a n older child's or adult's lap with their feet tucked under them. Sometimes children can explain how the injury occurred, but usually they have difficulty recalling exactly what happened. At times an older sibling or child care provider can solve the mystery. \t Infection \t Hip problems that cause a limp at this age usually are due to a viral joint infection and need to be brought to the attention of your pediatrician. When a child has an infection in the bone or joint, she usually experiences a fever, swelling of the joint, and redness. If the infection is in the hip joint, the child will hold her leg flexed or bent at the hip and be extremely irritable and unwilling to move the hip and leg in any direction, although swelling and redness may not be obvious in this deep joint.\t Hip Problems \t Sometimes a child is born with a dislocated hip (DDH, developmental dysplasia of the hip) that that may not be noticed until she starts to walk. As one limb is shorter and less stable than the other, she will walk with an obvious limp.\t Limping is a major reason that parents of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis seek medical care. In a typical case, a child will not complain of being in pain. But she limps nevertheless, with this limping at its worst after waking in the morning or from a nap, and becoming less noticeable with activity.\t Treatment \t With minor injuries, such as a blister, cut, or sprain, simple first-aid treatment can be performed at home. However, if your child has just started walking and is constantly limping, your pediatrician should evaluate her. It is all right to wait twenty-four hours if your older child develops a limp since sometimes the problem will disappear overnight. But if your child is still limping the next day, or is in extreme pain, see your pediatrician.\t X-rays of the hip or the entire leg may be necessary to make the diagnosis. If there is an infection, antibiotics should be started and hospitalization may be required. Intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be given in high doses to allow them to get to the joint and bone. If a bone is broken or dislocated, the limb will be placed in a splint or cast and the child will be referred to an orthopedist for evaluation and further management. It is also advisable to see a  pediatric orthopedist  if a congenital dislocated hip (DDH) is diagnosed.",

Routine cleaning  with detergent or soap and water removes dirt and grime from surfaces (ex: floors, walls, carpet, windows). Sanitizing  removes dirt and small amounts of germs. Some items and surfaces are cleaned to remove dirt then sanitized (ex:  bathrooms , counters, toys, dishes, silverware).  Some items and surfaces require the added step of  disinfecting  after cleaning to kill  germs  on a surface (ex:  changing tables , sinks, counters, toys). Use caution around cleaners, disinfectants & sanitizers  Although chemical disinfectants and sanitizers are essential to control communicable diseases, they are potentially hazardous to children, particularly if the products are in  concentrated form . Products must be stored in their original labeled containers and in places inaccessible to children.  Diluted disinfectants and sanitizers in spray bottles must be labeled and stored out of the reach of children.  Solutions should not be sprayed when children are nearby to avoid inhalation and exposing skin and eyes. Before using any chemical, read the product label and manufacturer’s material safety data sheet.  Questions to consider when selecting a disinfectant Is it inactivated by organic matter?  Is it affected by hard water?  Does it leave a residue?  Is it corrosive?  Is it a skin, eye, or respiratory irritant?  Is it toxic (by skin absorption, ingestion, or inhalation)?  What is its effective shelf life after dilution? About bleach Household bleach (chlorine as sodium hypochlorite) is active against most microorganisms, including bacterial spores and can be used as a disinfectant or sanitizer, depending on its concentration.  Bleach is available at various strengths:  Household or laundry bleach is a solution of 5.25%, or 52 500 parts per million (ppm), of sodium hypochlorite.  The “ultra” form is only slightly more concentrated and should be diluted and used in the same fashion as ordinary strength household bleach.  Higher-strength industrial bleach solutions are not appropriate to use in child care settings. Household bleach is effective, economical, convenient, and available at grocery stores. It can be corrosive to some metal, rubber, and plastic materials. Bleach solutions gradually lose their strength, so fresh solutions must be prepared daily, and stock solutions must be replaced every few months. Bleach solution should be left on for at least 2 minutes before being wiped off. It can be allowed to dry, because it leaves no residue. Household bleach can be used to sanitize dishes and eating utensils. The concentration of chlorine used in the process is much less than that used for disinfecting other objects. Cleaners containing disinfectants: By separating out the cleaning and disinfecting processes, you will reduce the amount of disinfectant chemicals used.  Soiled objects or surfaces will block the effects of a disinfectant or sanitizer. Therefore, proper disinfection or sanitizing of a surface requires that the surface be cleaned (using soap or detergent and a water rinse) before disinfecting or sanitizing.  Bleach (the sanitizer/disinfectant) and ammonia (the cleaner) should never be mixed, because the mixture produces a poisonous gas.  Not all items and surfaces require sanitizing or disinfecting. See the  Cleaning, Sanitizing, and Disinfecting Frequency Table  from the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) for more information.  Alternative/less toxic homemade cleaning products Alternative or less toxic cleaners  are made from ingredients such as baking soda, liquid soap, and vinegar. Many of the ingredients are inexpensive, so you may save money over time. However they may require more “elbow grease,” which means you may have to scrub harder.  Although the ingredients in homemade cleaners (e.g., baking soda for scrubbing, vinegar for cutting grease) are safer, not all are nontoxic. Treat them as you would any other cleaner, with caution. Talk with your pediatrician If you're concerned about cleaning product safety, talk with your pediatrician. Your regional  Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit  (PEHSU) have staff who can also talk with parents about concerns over toxins in cleaning products.

        "content": "An estimated one in six Americans get sick each year after eating  contaminated food . Anyone can get food poisoning, but  children  are more likely to be affected and have more serious illness.The good news is that most food-borne illness can be prevented by follow these  safety  guidelines. Cleanliness Be especially careful  when preparing raw meats and  poultry . Wash your hands and all surfaces that have come in contact with the raw meat and poultry, with hot, sudsy water before continuing your preparation. Always  wash your hands  before preparing meals and after going to the bathroom or changing your child's diaper. If you have open cuts or sores  on your hands, wear gloves while preparing food. Do not prepare food  when you are sick, particularly if you have nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps or diarrhea. Food selection Carefully examine  any canned food (especially home-canned goods) for signs of bacterial contamination. Look for milky liquid surrounding vegetables (it should be clear), cracked jars, loose lids, and swollen cans or lids.  Don't use canned or jarred goods showing any of these signs. Do not even taste them. Throw them away so that nobody else will eat them. (Wrap them first in plastic and then in a heavy paper bag.) Buy all meats and seafood  from reputable suppliers. Do not use   raw (unpasteurized) milk  or cheese made from raw milk. Do not eat  raw or undercooked meat. Do not give   honey  to a baby under one year of age. If your child turns away  from a particular food or drink, smell or taste it yourself; you may find that it is spoiled and that it shouldn't be eaten. Food preparation and serving Do not let  prepared foods (particularly starchy ones), cooked and cured meats, cheese, or anything with mayonnaise stay at room temperature for more than two hours. Do not interrupt  the cooking of meat or poultry to finish the cooking later. Do not prepare  food one day for the next unless it will be frozen or refrigerated right away. (Always put hot food right into the refrigerator. Do not wait for it to cool first.) Make sure  all foods are cooked thoroughly. Use a meat thermometer for large items like roasts or turkeys, and cut into other pieces of meat to check if they are done. When reheating meals , cover them and reheat them thoroughly.

        "content": "Hygiene Strategies When your child or another family member has a      cold  or cough, there are extremely important steps in addition to frequent      hand washing  that can lower the risk of spreading the infection to others. Some experts call these strategies respiratory hygiene, and they can be very effective if followed carefully. For example, to keep your sick child from blowing secretions into the air, where they can land on other people or on toys and other objects: Encourage her to cough or sneeze into a tissue or, if a tissue isn’t available, onto her sleeve. Discourage your child from covering her mouth with her hands while coughing or sneezing because this will leave germs on the hands that can be spread by touching other people or objects. Most often, germs are spread by the hands, not through the air. Throw away tissues immediately after each use, putting them in a nearby wastebasket or other container. Once your child is old enough, teach her how to blow her nose into a tissue. Don’t allow your child to share         pacifiers , drinking cups, eating utensils, towels, or         toothbrushes  whether she is sick. Clean & Disinfect Housecleaning may not be the most enjoyable activity in your day. If you spend a few minutes killing germs, especially those in the      kitchen  and      bathroom , it can go a long way toward keeping your child healthy. After you’ve prepared a meal, wash the kitchen counters with hot, soapy water and disinfect them using a household bleach solution or other      disinfectant . Infectious bacteria can thrive in foods like uncooked beef and chicken. In the bathroom, use the same cleaning and disinfecting routine on the toilet, sink, and other surfaces. This is especially important when a family member is sick with an infectious disease, particularly one that causes      diarrhea . Also, frequently clean the area where you change diapers, including the      changing table .      (Be sure you keep the bleach and all cleaning products         out of the reach  of infants and young children.)  Avoid changing diapers in areas where food is being prepared or consumed. Some germs can survive and thrive for hours unless you take steps to wipe them away. After using soap and disinfectant, dry the cleaned surfaces with paper towels or a clean cloth. After you clean up, be sure to wash your own hands. Handle Food Safely Food can become      contaminated  with bacteria and other germs that can cause stomach pain, vomiting, and worse. To limit problems: Make sure your hands are washed and the kitchen surfaces are clean before and after preparing meals. Clean your cutting board or kitchen surface after preparing raw meats for cooking and clean before using the surface to prepare any food that is not to be cooked such as salads, fruits, or vegetables. Cook ground meat all the way through. Wash raw vegetables and fruit thoroughly before eating. Avoid eating raw or undercooked eggs. Cook frozen food right after it’s defrosted. Clean utensils frequently during food preparation, washing them after they’re used on raw foods and before using them again on cooked foods. When it comes to leftovers, store them properly and get them into the refrigerator or freezer right away to prevent germ growth. Don’t leave perishable items out for more than a couple hours. Collectively, Americans are sick more than 4 billion days a year—and many of those sick days can be prevented. If you follow the guidelines, you will go a long way toward helping your child, as well as the rest of your household, have fewer infections; fewer missed days of child care, school, and work; less frequent visits to the doctor; and lower medicine costs.

        "content": "How many times have you and your child washed your hands today? You might not have given it much thought. It’s either part of your routine, done frequently without thinking, or maybe you don’t do it much at all. But as your pediatrician may have told you, hand washing may be the single most important act you and your child have for    disease prevention . Making hand washing a habit As early as possible, get your child into the habit of washing their hands often and thoroughly. All day long, your child is exposed to bacteria and viruses—when touching a playmate, sharing toys, or petting the cat. Once their hands pick up these    germs , they can quickly infect themselves by:  Rubbing their eyes Touching their nose Placing their fingers in their mouth The whole process can happen in seconds, and cause an infection that can last for days, weeks, or even longer. When to wash hands Hand washing can stop the spread of infection. The key is to encourage your child to wash their hands throughout the day. For example, help or remind them to wash their hands:  Before eating (including snacks)  After a trip to the    bathroom   Whenever they come in from    playing outdoors   After touching an animal like a family    pet   After sneezing or    coughing  if they cover their mouth  When someone in the household is ill Studies on hand washing in    public restrooms  show that most people don't have very good hygiene habits. \"Hand washing\" may mean just a quick splash of water and perhaps a squirt of soap, but not nearly enough to get their hands clean. Steps to proper hand washing So what does a thorough hand washing involve? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the following steps:  Wet your child’s hands.  Apply clean bar soap or liquid soap to the hands, and then place the bar on a rack where it can drain before the next hand washing.  Rub hands vigorously together. Scrub every surface completely.  Keep rubbing and scrubbing for 20 seconds to effectively remove the germs.  Rinse the hands completely, then dry them.\t \t  About antibacterial soaps Drugstore shelves are full of trendy antibacterial soaps, but studies have shown that these antibacterial products are no better at washing away dirt and germs than regular soap. Some infectious disease experts have even suggested that by using antibacterial soaps, you may actually kill off normal bacteria and increase the chances that resistant bacteria may grow. The best solution is to wash your child’s hands with warm water and ordinary soap that does not contain antibacterial substances (eg, triclosan). Regular use of soap and water is better than using waterless (and often alcohol-based) soaps, gels, rinses, and  hand sanitizer rubs  when your child’s hands are visibly dirty (and with children, there usually is dirt on the hands!). However, when there is no sink available (eg, the car), hand rubs can be a useful alternative. How long to wash hands Keep in mind that although 20 seconds of hand washing sounds like an instant, it is much longer than you think. Time yourself the next time you wash your hands. Watch your child while they're washing their hands to make sure they are developing good hygiene behaviors. Pick a song that lasts for 20 seconds and sing it while you wash. Encourage your child to wash their hands not only at home, but also at school, at friends’ homes and everywhere else. It’s an important habit to get into, and hopefully one that’s hard to break.

Immunizations against diseases such as  polio​ , for example, are especially important when your family travels internationally. Even though the number of countries where travelers face a risk of getting polio is small, outbreaks do occur, and it’s important for your child to be fully immunized and protected. Other (Non-Routine) Immunizations May Be Needed In addition to the routine vaccines, your child may need others as well. This will depend on the parts of the world to which you’re traveling and the activities in which you and your child will be participating.  Here are some examples:\t Meningococcal vaccine  is recommended for travelers to areas of Africa.\t Rabies  vaccines may make sense for children who will be traveling to areas such as developing countries where they could meet rabid dogs and other animals. These vaccines are particularly important when going to parts of the world where it could be difficult to quickly obtain rabies immunizations and medical care if needed.         Yellow fever may be found in parts of South America and Africa. Some countries require the yellow fever vaccine before allowing travelers to enter. Keep in mind, however, that your pediatrician may not have the vaccine available in the office, so plan ahead. Certain vaccines are usually given only at places chosen by state health agencies.         The typhoid vaccine is recommended for children and other travelers who could be exposed to contaminated food or water.         A flu shot may be given to a child traveling abroad, depending on issues such as the youngster’s current health and chances of being exposed to the flu. Flu season is different in the southern hemisphere than it is in the United States. For other immunizations, such as the MMR vaccine, talk to your pediatrician about the advisability of accelerating the vaccination schedule if your young child hasn’t yet been immunized. The first MMR vaccine, usually given at or after 12 months of age, can be given earlier (between 6 and 11 months of age) in children traveling to places where the risk for measles is higher. Before 6 months of age, an infant is protected by antibodies passed from his or her mother.  You can obtain up-to-date travel health information and advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( www.cdc.gov/travel ) or by calling a toll-free phone number, 877/394-8747. When traveling, it is a good idea​ to bring an up-to-date record of your child’s vaccinations. This record will be useful when entering a country that asks for proof of immunization against certain infectious diseases.  Other Travelers’ Diseases There are no immunizations for some of the diseases that may be found in other countries.  There are some steps you can take to protect your child: Travelers' diarrhea is the most common illness affecting international tourists. It occurs most often in developing countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Carefully choose foods and drinks for your child to prevent diarrhea.          Do not eat anything from street vendors and stay away from food prepared and served in unclean conditions.          Also          avoid raw or undercooked meat , as well as raw fruit and vegetables.  Only drink          water  that comes from treated sources. Safe drinks include bottled carbonated water and water boiled or treated with chlorine or iodine. Preventing mosquito bites can lower the risk of getting certain infections, including  Zika virus​ , chikungunya, ​malaria and dengue fever.          Have your child wear long-sleeved cotton shirts and long pants. Apply            insect repellent ​ containing DEET (diethyltoluamide) to bare skin.         It should be put         on lightly and washed off once the child comes inside.          Use bed nets and         window screens for added protection.          If preventive medicine has been prescribed for malaria, make sure it is taken as directed.​ ​",

        "content": "Each year, many parents rush their children to the pediatrician’s office or the emergency department after their youngsters have been bitten by animals or other humans. Consider the following statistics: there are about 4.5 million dog bites reported annually in the United States, along with 400,000 cat bites and 250,000 human bites. It is likely that the actual number of bites is much higher. While many of these bites cause only minor injuries, others are much more serious. In many cases, these bites produce infections. This occurs in more than 50% of cat bites and 15% to 20% of dog or human bites. \t Many people don’t realize that most bites come from domesticated animals that the child knows, not from wild or unfamiliar animals. A major concern for parents about animal bites is the child’s risk of contracting rabies. Rabies is a very serious viral infection that affects the central nervous system and brain, causing a high fever, swallowing difficulties, convulsions, and eventually, death. \t Fortunately, rabies in humans is rare today (most domesticated animals are vaccinated for rabies), but even so, the animal that bit your child may need to be confined and observed for 10 days for the presence of rabies. (Don’t attempt to capture the animal yourself. Contact animal control officials.) However, confinement is not always possible, especially when a wild animal is responsible for the bite. The greatest risk for rabies comes from wild animals such as bats, raccoons, foxes, skunks, and coyotes. \t Even when rabies isn’t present, an infection can develop at the site of the bite. Contact your pediatrician if any of the following signs of an infection are present: \t Pus or drainage from the bite wound \t Swelling and tenderness in the area around the bite \t Red streaks that extend from the bite \t Swollen glands that occur above the bite \t Prevention of Bites and Infections \t To prevent bites and the infections associated with them, here are some tips to keep in mind. \t Teach your child to avoid contact with wild animals. She also needs to stay away from dead animals, whose nervous system tissues and saliva may contain the rabies virus and who may be infested with fleas or ticks carrying various bacteria, viruses, and other infectious organisms. \t Never leave a young child alone with an animal. Even playful interaction between the child and a pet can overexcite the animal and lead to an unexpected bite. \t Don’t allow your child to tease a pet, play roughly with it (eg, pulling its tail), or grab its toys, bones, or food. \t Educate your youngster never to kiss or place her face close to an animal, nor to awaken a pet from sleep or bother it while it’s eating. Teach your child how to behave when approached by an unfamiliar dog. She shouldn’t run from the dog or make any aggressive movements, but instead face the dog, allow the dog to sniff her, and then back away slowly. \t Instruct older children to recognize the signs of a potentially unsafe dog, including a rigid body, a stiff tail at half-mast, a staring expression, hysterical barking, or a crouched position. \t Cover and secure all garbage containers, which will keep raccoons and other wild animals from being attracted to your home and places where children play. How Animal Bites Are Treated Here are some guidelines on treating an animal bite to lower the risk of developing an infection. \t How Animal Bites Are Treated \t Here are some guidelines on treating an animal bite to lower the risk of developing an infection.\t Apply firm pressure to the area of the bite using a clean bandage or towel until the flow of blood ceases. If you can’t stop the bleeding, contact your pediatrician. \t Wash the wound gently but thoroughly with soap and water, dry it, and cover it with gauze. \t Contact your pediatrician whenever any animal bite breaks the skin, even if the wound seems minor. Your pediatrician may decide to suture (stitch) the wound and perhaps prescribe antibiotics or treatment to prevent rabies or tetanus. Antibiotics are given most often for moderate to severe bites, puncture wounds, or bites to the face, hand, foot, or genital area. They are also used for children with a weakened immune system. \t If the animal is unavailable to be observed and the risk of rabies is considered high, your doctor will give your child a specific type of immune globulin and begin a series of immunizations against the rabies virus, which will prevent the infection from occurring. The immune globulin is injected into the bite wound. It must be given as soon as possible to be most useful. \t What should you do in the case of human bites, perhaps from a sibling or playmate? Contact your pediatrician and describe the wound. Your pediatrician will want to know whether the bite has broken the skin and if the injury is large enough to need stitches. If your doctor wants to examine the bite, wash it with soap and water before leaving for the office visit. For minor wounds that barely break the skin, a thorough washing and bandaging may be all that’s needed.",

        "content": "​Whenever children are together, there is a chance of spreading infections. This is especially true among infants and toddlers who are likely to use their hands to wipe their noses or rub their eyes and then handle toys or touch other children. These children then touch their noses and rub their eyes so the virus goes from the nose or eyes of one child by way of hands or toys to the next child who then rubs his own eyes or nose. And children get sick a lot in the first several years of life as their bodies are building immunity to infections. In many child care facilities, the staff simply cannot care for a sick child due to space or staff limitations, although in others, the child can be kept comfortable and allowed to rest as needed in a separate area of the room where they have already exposed the other children. When waiting to be picked up, an ill child who is being excluded should be in a location when no contact occurs with those who have not already been exposed to their infection. Often, it is best for the child      not  to be moved to another space to prevent their illness from spreading throughout the facility and to maintain good supervision of the child. In some programs, a staff member who knows the child well and who is trained to care for ill children may care for the child to a space set aside for such care and where others will not be exposed. If the child requires minimal care for a condition that doesn't require exclusion, there may a place for the child to lie down while remaining within sight of a staff member when the child needs to rest. In some communities, special sick child care centers have been established for children with mild illnesses who cannot participate or need more care than the staff can provide in the child's usual care setting. Even with all these prevention measures, it is likely that some infections will be spread in the child care center. For many of these infections, a child is contagious a day or more before he has symptoms. Be sure to      wash your and your child's hands  frequently. You never know when your child or another child is passing a virus or bacteria. Sometimes your child will become sick while at child care and need to go home. You will need to have a plan so someone can pick them up.  Fortunately, not all illnesses are contagious (like      ear infections ). In these cases, there's no need to separate your sick child from the other children. Most medications can be scheduled to be given only at home. If your child needs medication during the day, be sure that the facility has clear procedures and staff who have training to give medication. Ask what they do to be sure they have the right child, receiving the right medication, at the right time, by the right route and in the right dose–-and document each dose.  Measures to Promote Good Hygiene in Child Care:\t To reduce the risk of disease in child care settings as well as schools, the facility should meet certain criteria that promote good hygiene. Are there sinks in every room, and are there separate sinks for preparing food and washing hands? Is food handled in areas separate from the toilets and diaper-changing tables? Are the toilets and sinks clean and readily available for the children and staff? Are disposable paper towels used so each child will use only his own towel and not share with others? Are toys that infants and toddlers put in their mouths            sanitized  before others can play with them? Are all doors and cabinet handles, drinking fountains, all surfaces in the toileting and diapering areas cleaned and disinfected at the end of every day? Are all changing tables and any potty chairs cleaned and disinfected after each use? Are staff and other children fully immunized, especially against the flu?​​ Is food brought in from home properly stored?  Is food prepared on site properly handled? Is            breast milk  labeled and stored correctly? Are children and their caregivers or teachers instructed to wash their hands throughout the day, including:  When they arrive at the facility  Before and after handling food, feeding a child, or eating  After using the toilet, changing a diaper, or helping a child use the bathroom (Following a diaper change, the caregiver's and child's hands should be washed and the diaper-changing surfaces should be disinfected.)  After helping a child wipe his nose or mouth or tending to a cut or sore  After playing in               sandboxes   Before and after playing in water that is used by other children  Before and after staff members give               medicine  to a child  After handling wastebaskets or garbage  After handling a pet or other animal Make sure your own child understands good hygiene and the importance of hand washing after using the toilet and before and after eating.

        "content": "​​Children of all ages have      epileps​​y  and most attend school every day. As a parent or caregiver, you play a key role in providing your child's teachers and other school staff with the information they need to create a safe and supportive learning environment where your child can thrive. Sharing Information with Your Child's School  Work with your school to make sure teachers and other school staff know what to do when a seizure occurs. It is important that every student with seizures has a      Seizure Action Plan . This plan should be provided to all administrative staff and teachers at the school. Many schools have a form for students with special health care needs, sometimes called the \"Individual Health Plan,\" which can used as the Seizure Action Plan.  What's included in a Seizure Action Plan?  The seizure action plan should be reviewed and signed by your child's doctor and should include the following information: Detailed information about your child's epilepsy. What to do if your child has a seizure at school or on the bus. A list of anti-seizure medications that your child currently is taking, including how and when the medications are given, and any side effects.  Special instructions for the use of rescue medications, used in the case of an emergency, should also be included. If your child has a vagus nerve stimulator (VNS), then instructions on how to use the VNS magnet should also be included. A clear definition of what constitutes an            emergency  for your child, and what the school should do if one occurs. What else is important to do if your child is using a Seizure Action Plan?  Review and update the plan regularly. It is especially important to update when the medications change or dosages are increased or decreased. Make sure your child can take medicine at school. This might mean talking to the school nurse or another school official about how to give the medication.  Ensure that the Seizure Action Plan information is also available during school activities that may occur outside of school hours or off school property, such as bus rides, field trips, or sporting events. Educating Your Child's Classmates  It can be frightening for students to witness a seizure. Educating your child's classmates early on about proper seizure first aid and epilepsy can reduce stigma, decrease fear, and improve the overall acceptance of your child. Start by having a conversation with your child about his or her seizures. Explore when, where, and how to tell others about his or her epilepsy. Every situation and every child will be different, so doing some role playing and discussing how people might react can be helpful. Here are some suggestions about how to inform others: Consider reaching out to school staff to explore educating your child's classmates. Keep your child involved in the education process, too. There are many educational programs and tools available to help teachers create a basic epilepsy program. Be a special guest/presenter for the day. Use the curriculum available            here​ .

However, those with epilepsy can be an easy target. If you suspect your child is the victim of bullying or discrimination, contact the school to discuss it further. Here are some great resources:\t \t  Bullying Resource Center\t   Bullying.org\t   Stopbullying.gov\t   Epilepsy Foundation - Legal Issues   Getting to Know Your Child's School and the Staff Take the opportunity to connect and build partnerships with school staff, volunteers, and other parents. Here are some ideas on how to form those relationships:  Talk with your child's teachers and other school staff about epilepsy and explain what happens when your child has a seizure. Join and volunteer to help within parent-teacher organizations. Volunteer to assist at school functions, class parties, etc. Become familiar with the school policies and the school handbook. Organize meetings with teachers, nursing staff, lunchroom staff, bus drivers, etc. Like all children, those with epilepsy also need to become familiar with each person in the school that they will interact with, such as the school nurse, principal, etc. This is especially important as they grow older and begin taking more responsibility for their health care needs.  Preparing for Seizure Emergencies at School Emergencies can happen when your child is in school, and it is important to make sure everyone is prepared. Here's how to prepare your child and the school for a seizure emergency:  Research school and district regulations. Talk with the school nurse about how emergencies can best be handled. Develop an emergency plan as part of your child's seizure action plan. Keep contact information current. Share the plan with all school staff and volunteers (e.g., teachers, recess supervisors, physical education teachers, library staff, lunchroom supervisors, field trip chaperones, or after school activity staff.) ​Knowing Your Child's Rights\t   Most schools must follow the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and provide \"reasonable accommodations\" if your child has special needs. Other laws, like Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the  Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) , might also apply if your child has special physical or learning challenges.\t Be on the lookout for learning problems or challenging behaviors in your child. Know that you can seek help from the school counselor or request a psychoeducational evaluation from the school psychologist if you feel your child is not performing well.   Helping Your Child Thrive  Remember that your child is more like other students than different. One of your roles as a parent is to help them thrive in their school setting with confidence and a belief that they can reach any goal they set for themselves. This is best done by educating and preparing the school to meet their needs and building your child's or youth's capacity to eventually manage their needs when you are not around.

        "content": "By: Marissa Di Giovine, MD, FAAP & Eva Catenaccio, MD Epilepsy, also called seizure disorder, is the most common childhood brain disorder in the United States. Nearly 3 million Americans have epilepsy. About 450,000 of them are under 17 years old.  Epilepsy can cause repeated seizures, which are sudden surges of electrical activity in the brain. About two-thirds of all children with epilepsy outgrow their    seizures  by the time they are teenagers. For some, though, epilepsy may be a lifelong condition. It is important for parents to partner with their health care providers to help understand their child's condition and treatment. Understanding epilepsy and seizures There are many different    types of seizures . Some are very short, lasting only a few seconds, while others can last a few minutes. Some can cause uncontrollable jerking movements, while others cause them to be confused or stare blankly. The type of seizure a person has depends on where the seizure occurs in the brain and how much of the brain is involved. Improvements in epilepsy treatment in recent years have made the condition more manageable. Many new anti-seizure medications are available and more are being tested. In addition to newer medications,    alternative treatments  such as surgical procedures, medical devices, and    dietary therapies , are also available for children and teens who continue to have seizures while on medication. How is epilepsy diagnosed? Epilepsy is often diagnosed if a child or teen:  has had more than one seizure not directly caused by another medical condition, such as diabetes or a severe infection  has a high risk for additional seizures, based on their medical history or the results of medical tests  Any child without a known diagnosis of epilepsy who experiences a first-time seizure needs immediate  emergency medical attention .  They should also have a follow-up visit with their primary care pediatrician soon afterwards. If seizures happen again, they need to see a  pediatric neurologist , a specialist who manages seizures and epilepsy.    Finding Answers About Epilepsy\t By: Dylan Di Girolamo\t   I was officially diagnosed with epilepsy in 2017, though my seizures started years earlier. I would get these weird feelings of nausea and think I was about to throw up, but never did. As I got older, the nausea would start, and then I would forget where I was for 2 or 3 minutes. I was able to talk during these episodes, but I wouldn't make any sense.  By the time I got to high school, I realized something wasn't right. My doctor referred me to a neurologist, who ran tests but found nothing wrong. Deciding that these strange episodes may not be neurological, but psychological, they referred me to a psychologist. \t The episodes continued to get worse and more frequent, and I was starting to get really scared.  The psychologist asked me to keep track of when my episodes happened and, if possible, get videos of them. My close friends and family members were able to record a couple of of them. \t One day, as I was leaving his office, I had a really scary incident. I was walking to the bus stop, but the next thing I knew I was in the back of a police car. I apparently had set my backpack at the bus stop and went to sit in the middle of the road. The officers thought I was trying to hurt myself.\t I tried to explain that I sometimes got these episodes when I wasn't fully conscious and would do things that seemed strange. I gave them my psychologist's number, and he backed me up. The police let me go. \t My psychologist, convinced something more than psychological was going on, talked with my neurologist. After a few months and lots more tests, I was officially given a diagnosis: epilepsy, and more specifically, focal seizures with impaired awareness.\t Unfortunately, medicine does not seem to fully stop my seizures. I am working with a team of doctors to explore other possible treatments. I also continue to meet with my psychologist to discuss ways to handle stress, since stressful weeks do seem to act as a trigger for me. \t During those weeks, I do my best to get plenty of sleep and eat properly so my body is not stressed out. I also try to find time for relaxing activities like going out to eat with friends, working out at the gym, and playing soccer. Having epilepsy, I know I need to take extra precautions. But it won't stop me from working toward my goals. I graduated from college and now teach elementary students. And I will continue to search for answers about epilepsy. \t   Dylan Di Girolamo is a \t Young Adult Council member of the American Academy of Pediatrics National Coordinating Center for Epilepsy.  Find more stories from young adults living with epilepsy  here .\t \t  An epilepsy diagnosis varies for each child, but major steps in the process often include: Detailed medical history:  This may include questions about the mother's pregnancy and delivery; whether there are  any relatives with epilepsy ; and whether your child has had a prior history of serious head injury, infections involving the brain or a prior history of seizures with fever ( febrile seizures ). Detailed accounts of the seizure:  Whoever was with your child when they had a seizure should talk with the doctor. Videos taken of your child during their seizure also can be helpful as well. Physical exam:  In addition to a regular physical examination, the doctor will check your child's mental and neurologic function. This will include testing muscle strength and reflexes, for example, as well as senses and memory. Blood tests  to help identify other, underlying illnesses that could be causing seizures. Computerized Axial Tomography ( CAT ) or  CT Scan  to help determine if a seizure was caused by a recent injury or illness affecting the nervous system. Electroencephalogram ( EEG )  to help gauge how likely it is a seizure will happen again. An EEG can also help determine the type of seizure affecting your child, and whether it may be part of a certain  epilepsy syndrome  or pattern. Magnetic Resonance Image ( MRI )  to get a picture of the brain. This is especially important if your child is having new seizures or seizures that may have started in a particular part of the brain. Observation.  In addition to the exam and tests, a period of observation can help determine whether a child has epilepsy. If your child is diagnosed with epilepsy If your child is diagnosed with epilepsy, it is important to keep working with their doctor to classify the type of seizures and epilepsy they have. That will help guide treatment options. Since seizures do not often happen in the doctor's office, be sure to watch and track any unusual behavior and report it to their child's doctor. At-home videos can be very helpful!

Treatment for epilepsy usually begins with medication. However, it is important to remember that epilepsy is a complex condition, and every child is different. Not every child responds to treatment in the same way, so there is no one \"right treatment.\" Seizure-prevention drugs There are many seizure-prevention medications, called anti-seizure drugs, and new ones in development. However, it sometimes takes a while to find the one that works best for each child. These medications do not change the underlying cause of your child has seizures. They only treat the symptoms of epilepsy by reducing the frequency of seizures. The medication will not work properly until it reaches a certain level in the body, and that level has to be maintained by taking the medication regularly. For this reason, it is especially important to follow the doctor's specific medication instructions. Antiseizure medications may have side effects, though most are tolerated well without any side effects. Sleepiness is a very common side effect, but often may improve as a child's body gets used to the medication.  Other more serious side effects can include changes in bone marrow or liver function, or serious rashes. It is important to talk to with your child's doctor about possible side effects before starting a new anti-seizure medication. And if your child experiences side effects while on a medication it is important to let your doctor know so you can decide together whether the medication is right for your child. If epilepsy medication does not work, other options include: Brain surgery Medical devices to prevent and control seizures (for example a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS), a responsive neurostimulator (RNS), or a deep brain stimulator (DBS)) Dietary therapies (e.g.    ketogenic diet ,    modified Atkins diet ,    low glycemic index treatment ) How long does a child need to take medication for epilepsy? If your child does not have a seizure for a few years while taking medication, it may be possible to stop taking it. This is different for every child.    Your child should never stop taking medication unless recommended and closely supervised by their doctor. Shared decision-making for children with epilepsy It's best to work together with your child's doctor to make decisions and choose tests and treatments. You can take into account the potential risks and benefits of each option as well as your family's preferences and values. Shared decision-making is particularly important in epilepsy. This is because there is often no one right treatment; possible risks and benefits of each option may affect each child differently. Be sure to ask questions about different tests or treatments and share any special concerns or circumstances you may have. Examples of shared decision-making for epilepsy treatment include: Choosing a medication  based on the dosing schedule (taking a medication daily versus twice daily), available formulations (tablets, capsules, or liquids), or the need for laboratory monitoring. Deciding whether or not to repeat imaging studies  based on whether a child will need to be sedated, or when to schedule additional testing based on a child's school schedule  Risks for other medical issues Epilepsy can increase a child's chance of having a mood or  learning disorder .  Headaches  and other physical conditions are also common. It is important for parents to know about possible related conditions, also called \"co-morbidities,\" and talk to their child's doctor about any concerns.

        "content": "Most children and teens with    epilepsy  live full, active lives that include school, friends, sports and other activities. How much epilepsy interrupts a child's life depends upon the kind of epilepsy, the success of    treatment  and many other factors. Talk with your child's doctor about safely participating in activities. As your child grows, help them become more independent. Driving, college, career, marriage and raising a family certainly are possible for the vast majority of people with epilepsy.    (See, \" Teen to Teen: Managing Seizures While Figuring Out New Life Situations ,\" below.) Tips to encourage & support your child with epilepsy Learn as much as you can about epilepsy. Discuss epilepsy openly and honestly with your child. Also help your child talk openly and honestly    with others  about epilepsy. Avoid saying things that could make your child feel like a problem or burden. Be positive and    praise  your child's success. Encourage sports, hobbies and other interests. Help your child make    friends . Continue family activities and traditions. Make time for yourself without feeling guilty.    Respite  allows you to take care of yourself so that you are physically and mentally better able to care for your child. Build a support network for you and your child. Resources are available through the    Epilepsy Foundation ,    Parent to Parent-USA, Parent Training and Information Centers  and    Family Voices: Family-to-Family Health Information Centers . Establish routines. Routines, schedules and structure are what keep all busy families going. Schedule a regular time for homework. Have your child take medication at the same time every day. Involve them in taking charge of their medications. Make sure your child gets    enough sleep  to lower the risk of    seizures . Infants & toddlers with epilepsy\t Seizures occur most frequently during the first few years of life.  This is a time when the brain is going through its most dramatic growth and changes.   Recognizing and treating seizures as early as possible can help avoid learning and    developmental delays .   \t However, diagnosing seizures in infants can be difficult. They cannot communicate what they are feeling after a seizure or during medical tests. As a parent of caregiver, your observations are key. They are especially valuable and necessary for doctor's to effectively treat infants and toddlers with epilepsy. Finding child care for infants & toddlers with epilepsy\t \t  One of the biggest challenges parents of infants or toddlers with epilepsy can face is  child care.  Some child care centers may not admit children with epilepsy. Some refuse to give them emergency anti-seizure medication, even though they may be required to do so by the    Americans with Disabilities Act . Your local Epilepsy Foundation can provide information about laws and resources in your area.  See here for more information .  \t   School-age children with epilepsy When children are older, having epilepsy can impact many parts of their lives. This includes how well they do in school, what sports they can play and how they are treated by friends. The more you can do to help their child lead an active, normal life, the better. As with all school-age children, it is best to establish routines and set clear rules and limits. Sometimes, parents worry that upsetting a child with epilepsy can lead to a seizure. Usually, if you stay calm and your child is old enough to understand why you are stopping a certain behavior, it should not increase the risk of a seizure. Talk with your child's doctor if you have concerns about the best way to    discipline .    Teens with epilepsy The preteen and early teen years are difficult for everyone. It is a time of great change, new challenges and some dangerous temptations. For adolescents with epilepsy, the risks and insecurities of this age are increased. It is important to talk as openly as possible with your teen about epilepsy and any other concerns.\t Dating.  This is a normal part of teen life, but it's far from easy. A first date can be nerve-wracking under the best of circumstances, but epilepsy just adds another twist. Teens often worry about is how much and how soon they should tell their date about their epilepsy. They also worry about rejection. Here are some    dating tips and ideas  to share with your teen.\t Puberty.  Changing bodies affect how children look, feel and think. Changes in hormones can also affect seizures and medication needs, especially for girls. Sometimes, teens need to change in the amount or type of medication they are taking based on behavioral changes, for example.\t So cial life.  Having friends and fitting in may seem to be all a teen thinks about. Being \"different\" in any way, such as having epilepsy, is not easy. While parents can't make their child \"popular,\" they can help their child understand that having a few good friends is actually more important than having a lot of casual acquaintances. Teens should be encouraged to talk about epilepsy with their friends.\t Substance abuse.  Alcohol and drugs are dangerous for all children. This is even more true for children who are prone to seizures and may be taking medication for epilepsy. Discuss the risks with your child. Then talk some more, and encourage your child's doctor and others your child respects to talk to them, too. Even if it seems like your child is not paying attention, the message may eventually sink in. Discuss not only the risks, but also ways to get out of uncomfortable situations.\t Responsibility.  This is the time when teens are learning to be more independent and that their actions have consequences. If a teen gets epilepsy at this age, it could affect their independence for a while. As a teen begins to spend more time away from home, they will need to start taking on some new responsibilities. Work with your child and doctor to figure out the best way to organize and monitor their condition when they are away from home. When teens learn to drive, parents will need to check their    local state driving laws . Helping teens with epilepsy transition to adult health care Parents and medical professionals should work as a team to prepare kids for their move into adulthood and help them  transition  into managing their health condition. This will include responsibilities such as: Keeping track of medications Refilling prescriptions Making doctor appointments Asking questions of the medical team, etc. For more information and resources on building a care notebook,    click here .\t   Managing Seizures While Figuring Out New Life Situations\t By: Amber Sorenson, MA\t There were several times during my childhood that I had \"fainting spells.\" These may have been seizures, but I wasn't officially diagnosed with epilepsy until age 21. By then, I had experienced two    tonic-clonic seizures  during a relatively short time frame while studying abroad in England. Although I wasn't aware of it until a few years before my diagnosis, I was at an increased risk for epilepsy because I had experienced significant    head trauma  as an infant. In England, after numerous imaging tests, ER visits and trips to the neurologist, I started on levetiracetam. This is one of the most common anti-seizure medications. I also learned a lot about the importance of    self-care  to help lower the risk for breakthrough seizures. For me, this meant getting enough sleep, keeping stress to a minimum (easier said than done!) and perhaps most importantly, taking my medication as prescribed. Eventually, I returned to the U.S. I graduated with my bachelor's degree, went on to graduate school and earned a master's degree. I was seizure-free for over three years. Then, after the first week of my first full-time job and a big move, I had another tonic-clonic seizure. It was the first one I'd had in years. I hadn't missed taking any medication doses. My levetiracetam dose was adjusted, but I continued to have seizures over the next year—roughly one every 3 to 4 months. Despite every medication adjustment, I was left unable to drive for the better part of my first year out of school. I had to rely a lot on help from others to do things like getting to work or getting groceries. Since I had been seizure-free for so long, having them so frequently that first year \"on my own\" left me with a lot of uncertainty. My primary care provider started me on some anxiety medication. I tried a few different kinds over the next year. Mental health issues like    anxiety  and depression are heightened among people with epilepsy. But I think that can especially be the case for    teenagers  and young adults trying to figure out new life situations on top of having seizures. I also started seeing a therapist. I highly recommend this, especially for anyone facing seizures that seem difficult to control with medication alone. For teens and young adults, in particular, therapy is a great means to just talk about anything and everything, which can help lower stress levels. After my most recent seizure (the first one that happened in a public place), I got a medical ID bracelet. Although I already had medical ID set up on my phone, this gives me a bit more peace of mind if I'm out and about, on my own.\t Amber Sorenson, MA, serves as a Young Adult Council member of the American Academy of Pediatrics' National Coordinating Center for Epilepsy, and as a Patient Experience Bureau member and Transition Expert Panel member for the Child Neurology Foundation. In addition to serving in advocacy roles for those living with epilepsy, she has authored several publications on the effects of pediatric abusive head trauma on families.\t Explaining epilepsy to teachers & friends Help others in your child's life understand epilepsy. Make sure others know    what to do if your child has a seizure . This will help keep your child safe, feel more comfortable and do better in    school . By talking openly and honestly about epilepsy, parents reduce some of the stigma and fear about it.

        "content": "Watching your baby's every movement typically brings parents so much joy. But when a baby shows signs and symptoms of a serious neurological condition such as infantile spasms (IS), that joy can quickly turn into concern.\t Infantile spasms are little seizures that can have big consequences.  Early recognition leads to   better outcomes; waiting to seek treatment can increase your baby's risk of permanent brain injury. What are infantile spasms? Infantile spasms, first described with a group of symptoms known as West syndrome, is a form of    epilepsy  that occurs in 1 in 2,000 children. It typically begins between 2-12 months of age and peaks between 4-8 months of age. What do infantile spasms look like?  While these seizures may last only a second or two, they often happen close together with each spasm occurring every 5-10 seconds in a series.  During a spasm, the body stiffens suddenly. The back may arch, and the arms, legs, and head may bend forward. However, infantile spasms can sometimes be hard to notice—perhaps only the eyes roll up or there is a small tummy crunch.  Infantile spasms are most common just after a baby wakes up and rarely occur during sleep.\t    \t Soon after the spasms begin, parents may notice a number of changes in their baby:\t   Loss of    developmental milestones  previously learned (such as rolling over, sitting, crawling, babbling)\t Loss of social interactions and smiles\t Increased fussiness or silence\t Don't hesitate to talk with your pediatrician if your child is no longer meeting developmental milestones. Trust your instincts—you know your child best! Parents and childcare providers, or anyone wanting to educate a friend or relative about infantile spasms:    watch this video, below . You'll see a baby experiencing a cluster of individual spasms. Each spasm is less than 1 second; the child shows a look of surprise, a brief stare and lifting/extending of both arms. In between each spasm, the baby appears to be fine—this is very typical of infantile spasms.\t \t \t Empty heading\t   Continuing the Fight for Adelaide\t By Kelly Cervantes\t   Infantile spasms...It sounds so innocuous right? Like a shiver or a small jerk — if only. The truth is that infantile spasms is an emergency. Our daughter, Adelaide, was diagnosed with infantile spasms when she was 9 months old. I was out of town when my husband called to tell me that Adelaide was doing a weird repetitive head drop and seemed to be losing consciousness each time it happened. We decided he should take her to the emergency room out of an abundance of caution.\t I'll never forget walking into Adelaide's hospital room, having taken a cab straight from the airport, and seeing a shadow of the daughter I had left behind. I'll never forget the month we spent in the hospital trying to gain control of her chaotic brain waves.\t There are a couple powerful frontline treatments that may relieve hypsarrhythmia (the devastating brain wave pattern associated with IS) and even the seizures altogether. The side effects can be terrifying, but they are nothing compared to the damage of IS. In the best-case scenario, babies can get seizure control and live nearly normal lives with maybe just a few delays or    learning disabilities .  Children with the best odds are those developmentally typical prior to IS. Adelaide, unfortunately, was not. She was already diagnosed with a global developmental delay, hypotonia, and generalized epilepsy when we added infantile spasms to the list.\t Our fierce warrior passed away five days shy of her fourth birthday from a neurodegenerative disorder. She had battled and overcome hypsarrhythmia and infantile spasms three times in her short life. Each time Adelaide regressed to a developmentally fetal state and never fully worked her way back to where she was before the IS struck. One step forward, two steps back.\t Hopefully, there is a \"true\" diagnosis that can point doctors toward the best treatment plan available. Infantile spasms is a diagnosis of a seizure    type , but is not a diagnosis in and of itself. IS is a symptom of some larger problem and, like all epilepsies, results from a genetic or acquired condition. Fight for every scan, genetic test and second opinion available—be it through your neurologist or an outside research study.\t Infantile spasms is devastating, but there is hope as organizations like    CURE Epilepsy  fund research that could one day stop or prevent infantile spasms from ever wreaking havoc on our babies' brains. Science couldn't catch up to Adelaide, but I promised her that I wouldn't give up the fight.\t  \t   Above, epilepsy advocate Kelly Cervantes with daughter Adelaide, son Jackson and husband Miguel Cervantes. Adelaide was diagnosed with infantile spasms when their family moved to Chicago where Miguel starred in \"Hamilton: An American Musical.\" Read more about Adelaide's journey and the ongoing fight to end infantile spasms on Kelly's blog Inchstones at  www.kellycervantes.com . Photo credit: Lori Sapio Early diagnosis is key It is very important that infantile spasms are diagnosed early. If you suspect your baby may be having infantile spasms, talk to your pediatrician right away. Your child may need to be seen by a    pediatric neurologist . If you can, try to video any episodes of your baby having a spasm and show this to your child's doctors.  You may be told to go to the    emergency room  so a pediatric neurologist can examine your child. Your child may have to be admitted to the hospital to have a test called video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. Video-EEG is needed to verify specific brain-wave patterns during the spasms and to document specific patterns in between the spasms. Pediatric neurologists look for a distinct EEG pattern called    hypsarrhythmia . The seizures' appearance and EEG are so distinct that the diagnosis of infantile spasms can be made with certainty in most cases. Determining the cause of the spasms may be more difficult. Causes of infantile spasms There are many causes of infantile spasms; almost any brain abnormality or brain injury can cause them. More than 50 genetic/metabolic diseases are associated with infantile spasms, and many patients have other disorders that cause developmental delays (e.g.,    cerebral palsy ,    Down syndrome , tuberous sclerosis, etc.) prior to the onset of the spasms. Determining the cause of infantile spasms is very important, because it affects treatment and prognosis. Know the signs to ‘STOP’ Infantile Spasms. Keep this easily remembered acronym in mind: 'STOP' Infantile Spasms.\t \t \t   See  the signs: Clusters of sudden, repeated, uncontrolled movements like head bobs or body crunching.\t Take  a video: Record the symptoms and talk to your doctor immediately.\t Obtain  diagnosis: Confirm an irregular brain wave pattern with an EEG test.\t Prioritize  treatment: End spasms to minimize developmental delays  \t \t \t Treatment options The American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society    recommend  adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) as the first line of therapy for infantile spasms. This medication is given as a shot. The first doses are given in the hospital so your child can be closely watched for any side effects. Since your child will need to continue to get ACTH shots for about 6 weeks, you will be instructed on how to give your child the injections at home. The goals for this medication are to Completely stop the infantile spasms. Improve the abnormal EEG. In some cases, pediatric neurologists prescribe the    seizure medication  vigabatrin. Both drugs work well, but your child's doctor will talk with you about which medicine may be the better choice for your child. What is the outlook for children with infantile spasms? Even if the infantile spasms stop, many children develop other kinds of epilepsy and have    intellectual  or other    developmental disabilities  later in life. If the treatment is prompt and successful, the outlook is brighter. Normal development is possible for those who were developing on track before the spasms started.

        "content": "​​​​​No one knows why the ketogenic diet―which was developed in the 1920's―works so well for seizure control, but it does. And these days, it's widely considered one of the hottest food fads in America.​ What is the ketogenic diet?  The ketogenic diet (also known as the \"keto diet\") is a high fat, low carbohydrate, and \"just enough\" protein for growth and maintenance diet. Typically, it follows a ratio of 3-4 grams of fat for every 1 gram of carbohydrate and protein. This means that about 90% of the calories come from fat, requiring those on the diet to eat mostly fatty foods such as butter and cream. Although it may sound terrible, there are many creative recipes that make this a tasty approach. What distinguishes the traditional ketogenic diet from the modified-Atkins diet is the rigorous attention to food intake and limitation on total calories.  When should a ketogenic diet be used for seizure control?  Some      children with epilepsy  can have disabling seizures―up to hundreds per day―which can severely limit their quality of life and prevent them from participating in school and social activities. Seizure control is the first step in helping kids with epilepsy achieve otherwise normal lives. When      medication  isn't working and/or the side effects from it are too much to bear, the ketogenic diet might be offered as a treatment option. In fact, the statistics show that it is often more effective than another, new medication, and frequently also improves alertness and behavior.  According to a 2008      consensus report  from an international expert panel, the ketogenic diet \"should be offered to a child after two anticonvulsants are used unsuccessfully.\" The diet must be started and maintained under close medical supervision of an experienced medical team—including a dietitian.  Ketogenic diet looks different for every child and depends on several factors: The child's age and weight How the child and family eat (kosher, halal, vegetarian, organic) The child's diet prescription (the specific combination of fats, protein, and carbohydrates weighed out) The diet may not work for everyone but is suitable for many different patients. The ketogenic diet can be effective for all seizure types and epilepsy syndromes. Some of the specific disorders that often respond to the diet include      infantile spasms , myoclonic-astatic epilepsy, Dravet syndrome, Doose syndrome, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy, Rett syndrome, migrational disorders, GLUT-1 deficiency and tuberous sclerosis complex.  Ketogenic Diet in the Treatment for Infantile Spasms \t ​ The American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society                     recommend  adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) as the first line of therapy for infantile spasms. The goals for this medication are to completely stop the infantile spasms and improve the abnormal EEG. In some cases, pediatric neurologists prescribe the                     seizure medication  Sabril® (vigabatrin), especially for patients with tuberous sclerosis. Both drugs work well, but your child's doctor will talk with you about which medicine may be the better choice for your child.\t    If those medications do not work well, the ketogenic diet can be particularly helpful when used early in the course of the disorder. Using a formula-only ketogenic diet for infants and gastronomy-tube fed children has been shown to work better than medications over time.    Typically, children are started at a Level IV Epilepsy Center and monitored as in-patients by a ketogenic diet team that may include a pediatric neurologist, pediatric epileptologist, nurse practitioner, dietitian, nurse, and social worker.  How well does it work?  Although it does not work for every child,      several studies  have shown that the ketogenic diet does reduce or prevent seizures in many children whose seizures could not be controlled by medications or those who were unable to tolerate the side effects of their medications.  Over half of children who go on the diet have at least a 50% reduction in the number of their seizures. It can start to help after just one week, but more often it can take a few weeks up to several months to judge whether it will be effective. If the diet successfully controls seizures, it may be continued for several years under the supervision of the child's health care team. Many children on the ketogenic diet continue to take seizure medications but on average they require one less medication and often the dosage of remaining ones is lowered.  Does the ketogenic diet have any side effects?  The ketogenic diet may cause side effects in some children, including constipation, reflux, weight changes, and kidney stones (due to uric acid build-up in the blood). These problems can be minimized by staying hydrated and careful monitoring. Some families notice mood changes such as hyperactivity or irritability.  Many of the side effects can be reduced by adjustments to the diet or with additional medication.  If you are considering the ketogenic diet, ask your child's doctor to explain all possible side effects, what you should watch for and what action you should take for each one. ​Special Considerations for Families:\t  \t \t \t The ketogenic diet meal planning and preparation take time.  This can fit into your family schedule, but it takes practice and gets easier as you adapt to the new routine. All food or formula needs to be weighed daily and each meal must be eaten in its entirety.\t   The diet is very restrictive, especially for a young child . It controls the type of food and the quantity of food. Some children may feel isolated at school, because they cannot eat \"normal\" food. Many are just unable or unwilling to follow it, but most find it a far better alternative than frequent seizures. \t   It can be adapted to all ethnic diets―as well as for children who are allergic to dairy products  (although this can further limit already narrow food choices). The dietitian will be a great resource for you along the way and can help calculate the diet with foods your child likes.\t   There is a chance that, no matter how closely the diet is followed, it might not work for some children .\t   Children must be followed closely by a doctor as they follow the ketogenic diet . It is not something to try on your own.   Parent to Parent:                  Would you recommend this?\t ​ A 3 to 6-year follow-up                     study  of 150 children with epilepsy on the ketogenic diet asked parents the question,                     \"Would you recommend the diet to someone else?\"\t    An overwhelming majority (90%) of parents said that they would. Even though the keto diet is extremely restrictive, time consuming, and requires rigid maintenance, most parents found the potential benefits outweighed its drawbacks. Many parents in the study were more concerned about the side effects of the medications―and were grateful for the opportunity to explore an alternative option. Further, 55% would consider trying the diet again.   Are there other special diets for seizures?  Yes. Other special diets include: modified-Atkins diet, low glycemic index treatment, and MCT ketogenic diet. These may be used instead of the ketogenic diet for some children. If you have questions or would like to explore these options, talk with your child's doctor.

Important Tips to Remember:\t Keep all medications \t   up and away  from young children.  Some seizure medications are very dangerous if children take an overdose.\t Create a reminder system for medications.  From pill boxes to smartphone reminders, there are many techniques to help you and your child remember to take medication.\t Do not run out of medications.  Request drug refills several days before your child's seizure medications will run out. Depending on the medication,                        special insurance approval  may be needed for a refill to be completed.\t Discuss with your doctor what to do if your child misses a dose.  All epilepsy patients miss medication doses at some point. Depending on the seizure medication, it may be okay to take two doses close together or it may not be.\t Talk with teachers, school nurses, child care workers, and other caregivers about your child's seizures.  Caretakers should know the details of your child's seizures, including what seizures look like, how long seizures typically last, whether or not your child has to be taken to the hospital after a seizure, and any rescue medications needed to make seizures stop.  If rescue medications are prescribed, your child's                           school or child care  needs access to these medications. Make sure they are                           trained to administer  the rescue medicine, and have access to your child's seizure action plan.\t Be honest about how often your child misses taking seizure medicine and how often they have seizures.  Your child's doctor cannot make good decisions about how to prescribe seizure medications if they do not have correct information. Be honest with your child's doctor!\t Allow your older child to transition to being responsible for taking seizure medicine.  Some children with epilepsy continue to have seizures into adulthood. Allowing your child to take an active part in treatment, from an early age, helps later as a teenager becomes a young adult. Some ways to start making this transition include having your teen fill pill boxes, set reminder alarms, and make calls to request medication refills.

Seizures can be alarming. They are caused by surges in the brain's electrical activity and can cause a child to fall down and shake or twitch violently. Or, a child may suddenly become unresponsive during a trance-like staring spell.  While this all sounds scary, keep in mind that seizures in children usually are not medical    emergencies ; the majority of seizures in children will end on their own within five minutes. \t Here are some first aid reminders in case your child or a child in your care ever have a seizure:  Stay calm and provide    first aid  help to prevent the child from being injured during the seizure.  Know when to    call 911  for a child's seizure.  Follow up with your child's doctor after the seizure.  Steps to take if a child is having a seizure:\t   If you aren't sure if a child is having a seizure, give them a light touch and loudly call their name to try and get their attention. Stay with the child―do not leave them alone! Lower the child to the ground and turn them on their side. This will prevent them from     choking  if they vomit.  Make sure there are no sharp or hard objects nearby. Do NOT try to restrain or hold a child still during the seizure. Do NOT place anything in a child's mouth―like a rag or a sock. Many children clench their teeth during a seizure; you could get bit or injure the child. Look at the clock. Try to time how long the seizure lasts.    When should I call 911 for a child's seizure?  If this is your child's first seizure  If the seizure lasts more than 5 minutes  If your child is having back-to-back seizures and not returning to normal in between  If your child is not waking up after the seizure If your child was injured during the seizure If your child has any trouble breathing If your child's seizure happens in the water If your child has diabetes or other life-threatening medical conditions Follow up with your child's doctor after any type of seizure.  Children should always be seen by their doctor to determine what caused the seizure— high fever , for example, or other medical problems or neurological conditions such as    epilepsy . Your doctor can help you treat any underlying causes identified. They can also help create a \" seizure action plan \" in case your child ever has any more seizures.

        "content": "​​​​​There are many medicines that treat      seizures . But, seizure medications do not cure seizures, they control seizures. Some medications only work to control for specific types of seizures. Other medications work to control a wide variety of seizure types.  Choosing the Right Medication  Choosing the right medication depends on a number of factors including: Type of seizure a child has Age of the child Other medical problems the child has Other medicines the child takes Side effects of the medicine Seizure Medication Safety\t   It is important to understand how to properly take a seizure medicine. Some medications are given once a day while others are given twice or three times a day. Rarely, seizure medications may be given up to four times per day. Knowing both the brand name and  generic name , the dose, and when to take the medication is very important. Additionally, being familiar with possible  side effects  of the medication and any necessary blood tests while on the medication is helpful.\t   Only a few of the widely used medications used to treat seizures are approved by the FDA for use in children. Your doctor can tell you the details of your child's specific medication including the indications for use and its safety profile.   Types of Seizure Medication There are many different types of seizures and some medications work better for certain seizures types. Some common seizure types include      focal , generalized      tonic-clonic , and      absence . There is also a growing number of newer medications that can be used to treat specific types of seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures Common medications used for generalized tonic-clonic seizures include: Clobazam Lamotrigine Levetiracetam Rufinamide Topiramate Valproate Zonisamide\t Note: Many of these medications are also used to treat focal seizures.  Focal seizures Common medications used for focal seizures include: Carbamazepine Oxcarbazepine Lacosamide Absence seizures The most classic medication used for absence seizures is ethosuximide, but valproate is also commonly prescribed.  Side Effects from Seizure Medications All medications, even      over-the-counter medicines , have the      risk of side effects . Therefore, all seizures medications have some risk of side effects. Most children have few or no problems with side effects from seizure medications. Side effects vary by medication but may include: Feeling sleepy Rash Mood changes Irritability Stomach problems\t ​ Some less common side effects are hard to see and may affect the liver, kidneys, or blood cells. To monitor for these side effects, blood work may be done. Some side effects occur more often at higher doses and may be avoided if a lower dose of the medication can be used.\t   When a child shows signs of a potential side effect from a seizure medication, it is important to consider other possible causes of that side effect. For example, a rash may be due to a viral illness or an exposure and may not be due to a seizure medication. However, because rare cases of serious rashes from seizure medications can occur, it is important to watch carefully and notify your child's primary care doctor and epilepsy doctor in the event of a rash. Bone health  Some seizure medication affects how children build strong bones. This problem is especially important for children who need to take certain seizure medications for many years. If your child needs seizure medicines for more than a year or two, ask your doctor if they need to be monitored for bone health.  Interactions with birth control  Teen and young adult epilepsy patients should be aware that some seizure medications can interact with certain forms of      birth control . This can result in abnormally high or low levels of the seizure medication or ineffectiveness of the birth control medication. This can lead to poor seizure control and/or an      unintended pregnancy .  Seizure medications during pregnancy  Women who are taking certain seizure medications when they become pregnant have an increased risk of having a baby with      birth defects . Some medicines are safer than others during pregnancy. Pregnancy also changes the way a woman's body metabolizes seizure medicine, so doctors monitor pregnant patients very carefully. It is important to discuss seizure medication choices with your doctor prior to becoming pregnant, if possible. ​Long-term Seizure Medication\t   Parents often worry about giving a child medication every day to prevent seizures. It is important to know that seizure medications are usually very successful in preventing seizures and with proper monitoring they are quite safe. A child who has uncontrolled seizures is at risk of a variety of dangers including injury from falls, accidents, drowning, or even death.                     See \t   Seizure Safety: Tips for Parents .   Rescue Medications  If your child has epilepsy, you should also talk with your doctor about rescue medications. Rescue medications are used when a child has a very long seizure (usually 5 minutes or longer) or has a cluster of multiple seizures in one day. There are a variety of options for rescue medications. These include medications that are given as a dissolving tablet, a rectal gel, or a nasal spray. Some commonly prescribed rescue medicines are diazepam, clonazepam, and midazolam.

Guidelines for Keeping Your Child Safe at Home & in the Community There are a few basic things you can do to make sure you child is safe in a variety of situations Teach family members and friends proper seizure first aid. Inform family and friends when to call for help (i.e., when your child's seizure should be considered an                    \t emergency ). Have your child wear medical alert bracelet or necklace that says he or she has epilepsy. Ensure that your child takes his or her medicine on time, every day. This is very important to reduce chance of seizures. Make sure your child gets enough sleep. Not getting enough can lead to more seizures. Consider a helmet for your child, if he or she has seizures that cause frequent falls. A                    \t Seizure Action Plan  can be a useful tool to share with family and friends. It will help them all know what to do if your child has a seizure. Simple Steps to \"Safety Proof\" Your Home\t   There are many simple things you can do to make your                    \t home safer  for your child. \t Place padding on sharp corners, like those on tables and counters. Avoid glass tables. Have your child sleep on a low-lying bed. Use non-slip carpet. Avoid throw rugs. If your child wanders during a seizure, try the following:  Shut and lock doors that lead outside. Consider putting alarms on doors to alert you if a door has been opened. If your older child is ever at        \t home alone , be sure a neighbor or friend has a house key to check on your child. Put a locking \"safety gate\" at the top of stairs. Heat Sources & Fires Can Be Dangerous  If your child has uncontrolled     \t seizures , you need be extra careful when around all heat sources.  Heat safety tips for your kitchen: Have your child use a microwave for cooking – this is safest. If your child needs to use a stovetop, make sure he or she uses the back burner.  Electric burners are safer than flames. Consider serving hot things right off the stove onto plates. Make sure cups of hot liquid, like hot chocolate, have lids to avoid burns from spills. Heat safety tips for around the house: Be aware that hairdryers, curling and clothing irons, and open flames (fireplaces, campfires, candles) can be safety hazards and need extra caution. Hot water can cause        \t burns , so set the maximum hot water temperature in your house to 110 degrees Fahrenheit or less. Consider placing guards on open fireplaces, wood stoves, and radiators. Do not allow anyone to        \t smoke in your home . Do not allow your child to use or play with matches.  High Places Need Extra Precaution\t   If your child is still having seizures, he or she needs to be very careful around heights.\t Put carpeting on staircases and at the bottom of stairs to reduce injuries from falls and slipping. Avoid unprotected heights, like ladders. If your child wants to go up high, at home, school or for recreation, make sure he or she is wearing a safety harness and helmet.   Use Power Tools & Outdoor Equipment with Care  There are simple things you can do to make sure you child is safe when using any tools or electric equipment.  Make sure all equipment for cutting, chopping, and drilling has safety guards. Make sure electric or gas powered equipment ( lawn mowers , etc.) have an automatic shut-off switch – this means that it stops when you stop holding it. When using any tools, make sure your child wears protective eyewear, gloves and appropriate footwear. Water can be Dangerous – Both Inside and Outside Your Home When your child is around water, whether it is in the bathroom or the local pool, extra     \t safety precautions  need to be in place. Children with seizures should never bathe and swim without close supervision.  Have your child take a shower rather than a bath. If you child does take a bath, keep the water level low. Ideally stay with your child while he or she is taking a bath. Ask for the bathroom door to remain unlocked. Use safety glass, plastic, or a shower curtain for a shower door. Use safety glass in mirrors, as well. Have your child wear a        \t life jacket  when swimming in a large body of water to ensure that he or she always stays above the water's surface.  Make sure your child is never left unsupervised while in a pool, hot tub, inflatable pool, wading pool, etc. Encourage Children to Participate in Sports - Safely!\t    Playing sports can promote physical health, build community and enhance self-esteem. Children with well-controlled seizures can enjoy nearly all sports, from baseball to basketball to soccer.\t Contact sports can even be OK for some children with seizures, since there is no evidence they induce seizures. Swimming and water sports, harnessed rock climbing, horseback riding, and gymnastics can also be safe with for children with well-controlled seizures, as long as there is appropriate supervision.  Free climbing, skydiving, hang-gliding, and scuba diving are not safe.   Tips for Bicycle & Driving Safety\t   Bicycle safety  begins at a young age. Safety rules also apply to roller blades, inline skates, scooters (anything with wheels).     \t Helmets  are essential to protect a child from scalp and brain injuries, as well as facial bruising if a seizure were to occur.  Driving is not permitted when seizures are not controlled. State laws differ as to when an individual with epilepsy can drive. Know your state's laws about     \t driving with epilepsy . For additional questions or concerns, contact your child's pediatrician.

        "content": "By:  Michelle Han, MD & Marissa Di Giovine, MD, FAAP  Seizures are sudden events that cause temporary changes in physical movement, sensation, behavior or consciousness. They are caused by abnormal electrical and chemical changes in the brain. Not every child who has seizures is diagnosed with epilepsy. Here is what parents need to know about seizures, how to help someone who is having one, and when a child may be diagnosed with epilepsy. Are there different types of seizures? There are many different types of seizures. Some last for only a few seconds, while others may last longer. The specific type of seizure a person has depends on what part of the brain is involved and how the seizure spreads. Common seizure types Doctors divide seizures into two basic    types  based on where in the brain the seizure starts. These include:\t Generalized onset seizures  that start with seizure activity in the whole brain all at once.\t Focal onset seizures  that start with seizure activity in one specific part of the brain. Common generalized onset seizures\t Generalized tonic-clonic seizures  (previously called \"grand mal seizures\")  involve abnormal electrical activity in the whole brain. They are the most dramatic type of seizure; they cause rhythmic and sometimes violent jerking movements in both sides of the body with loss of consciousness. These seizures usually last for 2 to 3 minutes and will almost always end on their own.\t Absence seizures \t (previously   called \"petit mal seizures\")   are very short episodes with a vacant stare or a brief   (few seconds)   lapse of attention. They may also include other subtle symptoms like eyelid fluttering, rapid eye blinking or lip smacking. These occur mainly in school-aged children and may be so subtle that they aren't noticed until they begin    affecting schoolwork . Focal onset seizures   Focal onset seizures ( previously called \"complex partial seizures \" ) involve abnormal electrical activity in one part of the brain. During these seizures, a person may be aware of what is going on ( called a \"focal aware seizure\"),  or they may not be aware of what is happening    (called a \"focal seizure with impaired awareness\"). Regardless of whether the person is aware of what is going on during a focal onset seizure, they may have a variety of other symptoms. The specific symptom will depend on what part of the brain is involved in the seizure. Examples include rhythmic jerking movements in one side of the body; random, repetitive movements like wringing the hands or walking slowly in circles; or having an unusual sensation in one part of their body. In some instances, a focal seizure can progress to a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. What is epilepsy? The term   epilepsy   is used to describe seizures that occur repeatedly over time without something that is provoking them, such as an    acute illness with fever , or other medical conditions. A doctor would likely diagnose a child with epilepsy if the following were true: The child has had two or more unprovoked seizures more than 24 hours apart. The child has had one unprovoked seizure but the doctor thinks the child is likely to have a seizure again. If my child is diagnosed with epilepsy, what happens next?   If epilepsy is diagnosed, your child usually will be placed on an anti-seizure medication. They also may need further testing, such as EEGs, brain imaging, or genetic testing. Medication usually is continued until there have been no seizures for two years. Other disorders that can look like seizures Some children experience episodes that might resemble seizures but are really not. Examples include: Breath holding spells\t Fainting   (syncope) Facial or body twitching   (myoclonus) Sleep disorders   ( night terrors , sleepwalking and    cataplexy ) Tics or    stereotypies These may occur just once or may happen many times. Although these episodes may resemble seizures, they are not seizures and may require different diagnostic tests and treatment. What to do if your child is having a seizure Most seizures will stop on their own and do not require    immediate medical treatment . However, there are ways you can keep them safe and things you can do if the seizure does not stop on its own. \t Immediate steps to keep your child safe: Move them to a safe space to prevent them from falling or hitting things Lay your child on their side so they will not choke if they vomit Do not put anything in their mouth Do not hold them down\t If the seizure stops within five minutes , call your pediatrician immediately. \t If the seizure does not stop within five minutes or is unusually severe \t (difficulty breathing, choking, blueness of the skin, having several in a row ),    call 911 for emergency medical help .   Remember As frightening as seizures can be, the likelihood that your child will have another one goes down as they get older. Unfortunately, a great deal of misunderstanding and confusion about seizures still exists. That is why it is important that your child's    friends and teachers  become educated about their condition. If you need additional support or information, consult with your pediatrician or contact your local or state branch of the    Epilepsy Foundation of America .

Sometimes, it can be hard to talk about epilepsy. There is fear and misunderstanding about      epilepsy and seizures , but epilepsy is a common neurological condition—an estimated 0.6% of children have active epilepsy.  Talking about epilepsy can help people realize that children with the condition are just like other children and can lead full, active lives.  Talking honestly and openly about epilepsy will also help teachers, coaches, babysitters, family, friends, and other people who are with you children understand what epilepsy is (and what is not). You will also be able to tell them what to do in case of a seizure.      See \t   Seizure Safety: Tips for Parents .   General Tips on Talking about Epilepsy: Try to stay matter-of-fact and positive. Encourage questions. Have            resources  ready to share. Practice some            conversation starters . The key message is that people with epilepsy deserve respect and understanding and can lead full, happy lives like everyone else. Talking to Your Child or Other Children about Epilepsy: Be positive and use easy to understand language, not complex terms. Encourage them to ask questions and be honest about their fears. If you don't know the answer to a question, tell them you will find out and then follow through. Share            stories with pictures . You may want to share them with your child's teacher, too. If your child has epilepsy, help them understand their seizures, medications, or treatments. Remember to continue these conversations as your child grows and is prepared to understand more details about his or her seizures and treatments. Helping Your Child with Epilepsy Talk about It:   Your child may be nervous to talk about having seizures and epilepsy. They may not want to talk about it right after diagnosis and that's ok. They don't have to tell everyone; they may want to wait until they have had some time to think about it.  When are they ready to talk, here are some things parents can do to help:  Explain why it's important to talk about epilepsy and why educating others will help reduce fear and misunderstanding. Let them know how important it is for others to know what to do if they have a seizure. Give them tips on            conversation starters .

        "content": "​​​​​​Among those who have lost a loved one to Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy – or SUDEP – too many share a common experience: they had never heard about the risk that their child could die from the disease.  A tragic example is the story of Danny Stanton (see, “What Danny Did, and Still Does,\" below). His mom and dad only learned about the term “SUDEP\" from his death certificate. ​What is SUDEP? SUDEP refers to deaths in people with epilepsy that are not caused by      injury or drowning , for example, or other known causes. Many cases of SUDEP are believed to occur during or immediately after a     seizure. Studies show that about 1 in 1,000 people with epilepsy die suddenly. Among those whose seizures are not controlled by medication, that rate increases to 1 in 150.  Risk factors for SUD​​​EP Danny's parents established the      Danny Did Foundation  in 2010, with the purpose of keeping people alive until the ultimate solution – a cure for epilepsy – is achieved. People with lack of seizure control are at greatest risk for SUDEP. The foundation tries to raise awareness of the risk factors, such as:  Having            convulsive seizures , also called tonic-clonic or grand mal seizures Seizures that happen during sleep , also called nocturnal seizures  Missing seizure medications . Not taking medication as prescribed can lead to more seizures, which raises risk.  How to minimize SUDEP ​risk While there is no cure to prevent SUDEP, there are steps that patients with epilepsy and their families can take to minimize the risk as much as possible. Strategies include: Striving for maximum seizure control by closely following            treatment  plans Regular            exercise , and lifestyle habits that            reduce stress  and seizure activity Regular            doctor visits , especially if convulsive seizures are not controlled Monitoring for seizure activity specifically during sleep hours Considering options such as epilepsy surgery, or            dietary therapy Talking with your doctor about a cardiac evaluation, to rule out            heart  problems Ensuring that family members and caretakers know            seizure first aid  and emergency resuscitation measures, including CPR and            defibrillator  use  Seizure alerts & safety che​​cks  The best way to prevent SUDEP is to prevent seizures. Short of that, having another person present during or right after a seizure is a huge plus for safety. Most SUDEPs occur when a person is alone. However, there are technologies and devices that can alert family members and caregivers when a seizure happens, so they can do a well-being check. A growing number of alerting systems exist, but awareness of them remains low and insurance coverage is rare--even for the few among them that have FDA approval.  Caregivers can explore alerting devices as an added safety measure within a treatment plan. The Danny Did Foundation provides counseling for parents on how to select a device, as well as grant funding for families who need financial support to access a device.\t  ​What Danny Did, and​ Still Do​es\t By Mike Stanton\t \t  My son, Danny, died of SUDEP after a nighttime seizure when he was 4 years old. My wife and I feel the best way to honor the life of Danny is to redouble our efforts to prevent this tragedy from happening to others. In 2010, we established the Danny Did Foundation. \t The Danny Did Foundation works with the American Academy of Pediatrics to serve as a resource for questions and support. We collaborate with fellow advocates, healthcare providers and most of all, families, to educate and make positive change within the epilepsy community. \t Danny remains at the heart of the foundation's efforts, and our family. I talk to Danny every day. I ask him how he's doing, I care for him and I enfold his presence into mine: we remain parts of the same circle. \t The years since Danny's death have sculpted a new relationship between us. What at the beginning was complicated has smoothed out into welcome routine. As with any relationship, there are emotions: happiness and sadness, and there is too a dual longing for what was. Regardless, ours is a parent-child relationship, and so —undeterred by the logistics— we still share adventurous eyes toward the future. He is my son, and I am his dad. \t Danny Did Foundation takes its name from the last line of Danny's obituary. “Please go and enjoy your life. Danny did.\" We celebrate Danny's spirit in every child and family we reach. \t Communication is​​ key  Like so many parents, Danny's mom and dad believed they had the best possible treatment plan in place. Yet, 10 years later, awareness of epilepsy's mortality risk remains stubbornly low. Mortality rates for people with epilepsy are up to three times higher than the general population, and caregivers in our community deserve and need to be informed. If you haven't had a conversation with your healthcare team about SUDEP, ask about the risk level for your child.

        "content": "Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in  sexually active teenaged girls . It appears to be caused by a bacterial imbalance or overgrowth in the vagina, resulting in an increase in harmful bacteria. The actual organism responsible for vaginosis hasn’t been clearly identified.  BV is uncommon in sexually inexperienced females. The presence of BV in girls before puberty raises concerns about but does not prove  sexual abuse .  ​Signs and Symptoms In many cases, BV does not cause any signs or symptoms.  A t other times, BV may cause: A white vaginal discharge that coats the walls of the vagina Vaginal discharge with an unpleasant or fishlike odor Vaginal pain or itching Burning during urination Doctors are unsure of the incubation period for bacterial vaginosis. How Is the Diagnosis Made? Your child’s pediatrician can make the diagnosis of BV during a physical examination by looking for the signs associated with the infection. The doctor can also order a laboratory analysis using a sample of vaginal secretions to detect bacteria associated with the infection. If BV is diagnosed in a sexually active teenager, she should be tested for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as: Syphilis Gonorrhea Chlamydia Hepatitis B Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Treatment Treatment is recommended for all teenaged girls and adult women who have signs and symptoms of BV.  Common treatments include  an oral or gel formulation of metronidazole or, in some cases, clindamycin in a cream preparation. What Is The Prognosis? Proper treatment can resolve a BV infection. Teenaged girls and women with BV may have an increased risk of developing  pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) . If BV is present in a pregnant woman, it can increase the likelihood of premature delivery or endometriosis. Prevention While acknowledging that the best preventive steps are unknown, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has noted that the risk of BV may be reduced by limiting the number of sexual partners and not using douches, which can upset the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina. It is not necessary to treat the male partner of a patient with BV.",

        "content": "By: Lawrence Noble, MD, FAAP For decades, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advised people with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) against breastfeeding to avoid passing the virus to their infant. However, in light of how current HIV treatments can reduce the risk of HIV transmission through human milk, we have    changed  our policy. Here's what parents need to know about the policy change, and what to consider if you have HIV and would like to breastfeed your baby. Why did AAP change its position on breastfeeding with HIV? The reason for the change is that research now shows that the risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding is very low when the nursing parent is on appropriate treatment, and when blood tests show that there is no detectable HIV.  While avoiding breastfeeding is the only option to guarantee that the virus is not transmitted, a parent with HIV who want to breastfeed or feed their pumped milk to their infant should now speak with their health care professionals to learn the safest way to do so.  What is the new policy? The AAP breastfeeding recommendations are updated in our clinical report, \" Infant Feeding for Persons Living With and at Risk for HIV in the United States .\"  In the report, we recognize that without treatment, pregnant people with HIV can pass the virus to their infants during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding. However, today, medications are available that, if taken every day, can keep people with HIV healthy—and significantly reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to their infants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also    updated  its policy. How much can antiretroviral treatment reduce the risk of HIV transmission through breast milk? Recent research finds that the risk of HIV transmission from breastfeeding—if the parent is receiving    antiretroviral treatment  and tests show    viral suppression —is less than 1%. The lactating parent should weigh this small risk against the numerous health, psychosocial and financial    benefits of breastfeeding . What should a pregnant person with HIV know before deciding whether to breastfeed? The AAP recommends that parents living with HIV who want to breastfeed:  Start antiretroviral treatment early in or before pregnancy. Maintain viral suppression. Make sure they can get treatment while breastfeeding. Stay committed to continuing treatment while they breastfeed. We also recommend that parents living with HIV talk with their health care team about the risks and benefits of breastfeeding. This will help them decide what will work best for them when feeding their baby. The AAP has strongly  supported  breastfeeding for decades and now support parental infant feeding choices in people with HIV who are on successful treatment. All healthcare professionals should support the family's decision to breastfeed or not breastfeed.

        "content": "Chlamydia is the most commonly reported  sexually transmitted infection (STI) . Caused by Chlamydia trachomatis bacteria, it occurs at high rates in  sexually active teenagers . A genital Chlamydia infection can be spread between sexual partners during vaginal, oral, or anal sexual contact. An infected mother can pass it on to her newborn child. In fact, about 50% of infants delivered vaginally to infected mothers get chlamydia. A smaller number delivered by cesarean birth also get the disease.   \t If present beyond the newborn period in a child who has not yet reached  puberty , a chlamydial infection may be a sign of  sexual abuse .\t Signs and Symptoms\t Chlamydial infection is often called a “silent disease” because so many infected people have no symptoms. This is the case with about three fourths of infected females and about half of infected males. As a result, many infections go unrecognized.\t When symptoms are present, females may have:\t An abnormal vaginal discharge\t A burning sensation during urination\t Lower abdominal pain\t Low back pain\t Fever\t Nausea\t Bleeding between periods\t Painful sexual intercourse\t Males may have:\t An abnormal discharge from the penis\t Itching or burning around the tip of the penis\t A burning sensation while urinating\t Tenderness or pain of the testicles\t Males and females may develop Reiter syndrome with arthritis, burning during urination, and inflammation with redness of the eyes. When newborns get a chlamydial infection from their mothers, they may develop  eye inflammation (conjunctivitis) with redness , swelling, and discharge, with or without  pneumonia . The pneumonia often causes cough and rapid breathing.\t If illness is present, it typically begins after an incubation period of 1 to 3 weeks. Pneumonia may occur up to several months after birth in newborns.\t What You Can Do\t Any sexually active male or female can be infected with C trachomatis. Make sure your teenaged son or daughter knows about the risks of a sexually active lifestyle and how to practice safe sex.\t When To Call Your Pediatrician\t Call your pediatrician if your child complains of symptoms listed here. If your newborn has an eye discharge or cough, you should call your pediatrician.\t How Is the Diagnosis Made?\t Your doctor can collect a specimen (eg, of pus) from the cervix or penis and have it tested in the laboratory for evidence of chlamydial infection. A urine sample can also be tested.\t If a chlamydial infection is diagnosed in a sexually active teenager, he should be tested for other STIs, including syphilis, HIV,  gonorrhea , and  hepatitis B . Gonorrhea and chlamydial infection often occur together. His sexual partner(s) should also be notified and tested.\t Treatment\t To treat chlamydia, your pediatrician will prescribe antibiotics such as oral doxycycline or azithromycin.\t A child with chlamydial pneumonia or conjunctivitis should be treated with oral medications like erythromycin. Topical treatment of the eye infection, such as with eyedrops, is ineffective and unnecessary.\t What Is the Prognosis?\t Prompt treatment should resolve a chlamydial infection and prevent complications. If the infection is not treated, serious complications can develop, including  pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)  which is an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries in girls and women that can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancies (pregnancy outside the uterus). A person with a chlamydial infection is also more likely to contract an HIV infection. Complications are less common in teenaged boys and men, but may include inflammation of the epididymis (the coiled tube that runs along the back of the testicles).\t Prevention\t Your teenager can avoid getting chlamydia by practicing safe sex. If your teenaged daughter is sexually active, she should be screened or tested for a C trachomatis infection, even if she doesn’t have symptoms.",

The infection is spread through intimate contact, including sexual interactions. When it is present in a child after the newborn period and before  puberty , this infection may be a sign of  sexual abuse . \t Gonorrhea can also be spread from a mother to her baby during  delivery .\t Signs and Symptoms  Gonorrhea of the genital tract typically causes symptoms in males, but is often symptom free in females.   \t In boys and men, symptoms most often include:\t A pus-like discharge from the penis\t Pain in the penis\t Burning during urination\t If symptoms occur in women, they may include:\t Pain or burning during urination\t Bleeding connected with sexual intercourse\t A yellow or bloody discharge from the vagina \t Even a symptom-free infection in women can lead to complications such as  pelvic inflammatory disease (PID),  which affects the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes and can lead to infertility or ectopic pregnancies. In males, the most common complication is called epididymitis, an inflammation of the coiled tube that runs along the back of the testicles. \t When the infection occurs in a newborn, it most commonly causes severe  eye infections .\t When to Call Your Pediatrician  Contact your pediatrician if your teenager has symptoms like those described here. Gonorrhea has symptoms similar to other STIs, so an accurate diagnosis is important. If a newborn has eye discharge, you should call your pediatrician right away.  \t How Is the Diagnosis Made?  A number of laboratory tests can be performed to diagnose gonorrhea. Your pediatrician may take a sample of the discharge from the cervix or the penis and have it tested in the laboratory. Urine tests can also be conducted. If a newborn has discharge from the eye, it is tested by microscopic examination and culture.   \t When gonorrhea is diagnosed, the patient should be tested for other STIs such as  syphilis ,  HIV , chlamydial infection, or  hepatitis B . In fact, gonorrhea and chlamydial infections often occur at the same time. The sexual partners of the infected person should also be tested for STIs.\t Treatment  Gonorrhea can be treated with  antibiotics  such as a single high oral dose of medicines called cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones or a single injection of ceftriaxone. If a young child is infected, she may also be treated with an injection of ceftriaxone. If chlamydial infection cannot be excluded, your child’s doctor may recommend treating for both infections.   \t What Is the Prognosis?  When gonorrhea is treated quickly and properly, the infectious organisms can be eliminated and complications can be avoided.   \t Prevention  To prevent the transmission of  N gonorrhoeae , your adolescent should practice safe sex.   \t Immediately after birth, infants are routinely given tetracycline or  erythromycin ointment  in their eyes to protect them from gonorrheal infection.",

        "content": "HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)  is a virus that can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). While there is no cure for HIV,  early diagnosis  and treatment are very effective at keeping people healthy. In addition, there are things you can do to prevent getting HIV. Read on to learn more about HIV and AIDS and how to keep you and your children healthy. What are HIV and AIDS? HIV is a virus that causes damage to the body's immune system. The immune system is the body's way of fighting infections. When the immune system does not work well, the body cannot fight off many serious illnesses. The damage caused by HIV can occur over months, as sometimes happens when infants have HIV. In adults with HIV, the damage can occur more slowly. People with HIV are said to have AIDS when their immune systems are severely damaged or when HIV-related infections or cancers occur. Because it can take years for symptoms to develop, many people do not know they have HIV. During this time, they can unknowingly spread the virus to others. Most people with HIV appear healthy. You cannot tell just by looking at people whether they have HIV. A blood test is the only way to be sure. HIV can be spread in the following ways: By  sexual intercourse   (vaginal, anal or oral) with a person who has HIV.  Both males and females can spread HIV. Through contact with an HIV-infected person's blood.  This can happen when sharing syringes or needles, accidentally getting stuck by a needle with a person's blood on it, or contact with other body fluids containing blood. To a baby by a parent with HIV  during pregnancy, labor, delivery,  breastfeeding  or sharing pre-chewed food. Through blood or blood products from blood transfusions, organ transplants or artificial insemination.  This is very rare because today donated blood, sperm, tissue and organs are routinely screened and tested for HIV. You cannot get HIV by: Shaking hands or hugging a person with HIV Sitting next to or playing with a person with HIV Eating food prepared by a person with HIV Sharing a glass, utensil or plate with a person with HIV Also, you cannot get HIV from: The air Insect bites  (including mosquito bites) Giving blood Sharing bathrooms Swimming pools   What your children should know about HIV and AIDS Teach your children the facts about HIV and AIDS, including how HIV is not spread. Young children will not be able to understand all of the information, but they should know: To never touch anyone else's blood. To never touch needles or syringes. If they find one in the garbage or on the ground, they should tell an adult. Older children and teens should know about: Abstinence .  The best way to protect themselves against HIV and other  sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  is to not have any type of sex (vaginal, anal, or oral). Let them know that many people wait to have sex. Condoms .  The best way to lower the risk of getting HIV and other STIs, if they are sexually active, is to use a latex condom and limit the number of sexual partners they have. Teens should also know about other types of  birth control . However, make sure they know that other forms of birth control will not protect them from HIV or other STIs. If teens are sexually active, encourage them and their partners to be tested for HIV and STIs before sexual activity. Drug use .  Drugs that are injected with needles are the riskiest because the needle or syringe can spread blood from one person to another. Using other drugs like  alcohol ,  marijuana  or \"club\" drugs can also increase the risk of getting HIV. This is because drugs affect a person's judgment and can lead to risky behaviors, like having sex without a condom or with multiple partners. Who should be tested for HIV? Anyone involved in the risky behaviors listed previously should get an HIV test. Keep in mind, a negative test does not mean a person is safe if the risky behaviors took place only a few months before the test. This is because it can take several months for the HIV test to become positive. The following symptoms may suggest a need for HIV testing:  Persistent  fevers Loss of appetite Frequent  diarrhea Poor weight gain or rapid weight loss Swelling of the  lymph nodes  (glands) that does not go away Extreme tiredness or lethargy that does not go away with rest White spots  in the mouth Recurring or unusual infections  How is HIV treated? There is no cure for HIV or AIDS. However, there are medicines that can help delay symptoms, prevent the virus from spreading to an unborn baby, and help prevent additional infections in people with HIV.  Because starting treatment for an HIV infection early (before there are symptoms of AIDS) is most effective at preventing symptoms and keeping people healthy, it is important to get tested to know if you have an HIV infection. If you do, you can stay healthy for many years if you start medicines as early as needed and stay on them. Remember HIV and AIDS are important issues to think and talk about. Knowing the facts about HIV and AIDS is the best way to keep you and your family healthy. If you need more information, talk with your child's doctor.

        "content": "By Katherine Hsu, MD, MPH, FAAP & Natella Rakhmanina, MD, PhD, FAAP Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes    acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS ), can affect anyone. This includes infants, children and teens. Since HIV first became an epidemic in the 1980s, there have been major advances in treatment and survival rates. But untreated HIV infection can develop into AIDS, which eventually leads to severe illnesses and death. Teens and HIV An estimated 21% of all new HIV infections in the United States occur in    teens  and    young adults . Yet most sexually active 13- to 24-year-olds often don't realize that they're at risk for HIV, so they don't get tested.    In fact, this age group is more likely than any other to have undiagnosed HIV. Even when they are diagnosed, teens and young adults are less likely than other people to get treatment. And because this age group also has lower rates of    viral suppression  (when treatment gets the virus to an undetectable level), they're less likely to stay healthy. All of these factors increase their risk of transmitting HIV to others. How is HIV spread? Most often, HIV is transmitted during sexual intercourse through body fluids such as semen and vaginal fluids. It can also be spread through intravenous drug use. Blood, blood products, needles, or other sharp instruments contaminated with infected body fluids or blood can also spread HIV. Infants and children most often get HIV infection from a birth parent with infection. The virus cannot be spread through any of the following interactions with an HIV-positive person: Hugging or sitting next to them Shaking their hand Playing with their toys Eating food prepared by them HIV transmission in schools or childcare centers has not happened either. Signs & symptoms of HIV    HIV is an infection that lasts a lifetime. But symptoms may not appear for many months or years after picking up the virus. In fact, the average time from getting the virus until developing the signs of AIDS in teenagers and adults is 10 to 11 years. This means that teens and young adults may not be aware that they are infected and can spread HIV to others. When people are infected with HIV, the virus attacks their immune system. Signs and symptoms may include: Swollen lymph nodes Recurrent diarrhea Minor skin infections Persistent fungal infections of the mouth (thrush) Failure to gain weight or grow in height at a normal rate An enlarged liver and spleen  As the immune system continues to weaken, AIDS-related infections and    cancers  can develop. How is HIV diagnosed? Typically, blood or oral fluids are used to    diagnose HIV infection . There are three types of tests available:\t Nucleic acid test (NAT):  This test uses blood to check how much of the virus is in the body.\t Antigen/antibody test:  Antigens are foreign substances (such as a virus, bacteria, or pollen) that cause your immune system to react. When you're exposed to a virus like HIV, your immune system makes antibodies to fight it. In HIV, the specific antigen is called p24. It shows up even before antibodies do. This blood test looks for both HIV antibodies and p24.\t Antibody test:  This test uses either oral fluid or blood to look for HIV antibodies. Self-tests and most rapid tests for HIV are antibody tests. HIV screening for all teens  All teens ages 13 years and older are recommended to get at least one routine HIV screening. After the first screening, teens who are sexually active should be screened for HIV at least yearly. If they're at high risk, they may even need to be tested every 3 to 6 months and can get risk counselling from their pediatrician. Teens at high risk for HIV can be prescribed medications to prevent HIV called PrEP. PrEP could be a pill taken once daily or a shot given every 8 weeks. Those at high risk include males having male sexual contact; people who inject drugs, transgender youth; youth of both genders having sexual partners with HIV or who inject drugs; youth who exchange sex for drugs or money; or teens who have had a diagnosis of or request testing for other STIs. What if the test is positive? If your teen tests positive for HIV, they need to be promptly linked to care and should consider letting their sexual partners know. For help with this, get in touch with your local or state public health department. They should have a confidential    Partner Notification Services  program of some sort that can notify your teen's past and present partners without disclosing your teen's identity. Keep in mind that in some states, the law requires informing sexual or injection partners that you have HIV. You can check your state's HIV-related laws with    The Center for HIV Law and Policy . How is HIV treated? Doctors use combination of several antiretroviral drugs to treat people with HIV, including infants, children and teens. These medicines lower the levels of HIV in the blood to being undetectable and prevent transmission of the virus to others through sexual contact. Sticking with treatment It's important for your child to take their HIV medications daily, exactly as they are prescribed. This prevents the development of HIV resistance and associated infections and helps your child's immune system stay strong and healthy. If your child is having a hard time sticking with their treatment, be sure to talk with your doctor. They can help you pinpoint the problems and come up with a new plan to help make it easier. Your teen may have been exposed to HIV after sexual activity, sharing needles, or sexual violence. In these cases, your doctor will consider giving your child post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with medicines that work against HIV. If PEP is started within 72 hours after exposure, it's extremely effective in preventing HIV. For teens at high risk for HIV, your doctor can also prescribe medicine that can prevent acquiring HIV called PrEP.  What is the outlook for children and teens with HIV?  HIV infection is a serious, life-long disease with no effective cure, but very effective treatments are available. When it's undiagnosed or HIV medications aren't taken regularly, people are more vulnerable to serious illnesses. But the good news is that kids and teens with HIV can expect to live a long and fulfilling life as long as they take their medications as directed. How to prevent HIV transmission Teens In 2019, 27% of high school students reported that they engaged in sexual activity. By the 12th grade, this number was up to 37%. But only 54% of sexually active high school students said they used condoms during their last sexual encounter.\t If your teenager is sexually active, they should practice safe sex. This means using a \t   condom  during EVERY sexual experience.  Even when people infected with HIV don't have symptoms, they can still spread the virus to others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option if your teen is at risk for getting HIV. PrEP means taking medicine to prevent acquiring HIV. When it's taken as prescribed, PrEP lowers your risk of getting HIV by around 99%. Pregnant women & babies Medicines that work against HIV help a pregnant woman with HIV to prevent transmitting the virus to her baby. These medicines keep the mom-to-be healthy too. If you have HIV, your newborn will be treated with medicines that work against HIV for at least few weeks, until it becomes clear whether or not the baby has acquired HIV.\t Breast milk  can transmit HIV to your baby. However, the risk is very low if you are on treatment and have no detectable HIV virus in your blood. Parents living with HIV should speak with their healthcare professionals to help them decide how to best feed their baby. When your baby starts eating    solid foods , don't pre-chew the baby's food to avoid passing the virus to your baby.

        "content": "Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), an infection of the female upper genital tract, is a serious complication of some  sexually transmitted infections (STIs) . It occurs most often in  teenaged  and  young adult  females. Pelvic inflammatory disease can affect the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. \t Sexually transmitted organisms, especially those responsible for gonorrhea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) and chlamydial infections (Chlamydia trachomatis), are thought to be the cause of most cases of PID, although other organisms are associated with some cases. The germs from these infections travel from the vagina and cervix into the upper genital tract.\t Signs and Symptoms\t In some cases, no signs or symptoms are present, but the infection can still harm the reproductive system. In most cases, however, PID causes persistent lower abdominal or pelvic pain and tenderness, with an intensity that can range from mild to severe. These symptoms often begin about a week after the onset of a period.\t Additional symptoms may include:\t Fever \t Vomiting\t An abnormal vaginal discharge \t Irregular menstrual bleeding \t Right upper abdomen pain (uncommon)\t When To Call Your Pediatrician\t If your daughter complains of symptoms associated with PID, she should be seen by her pediatrician immediately, even if she denies sexual activity.\t How Is the Diagnosis Made?\t Pelvic inflammatory disease is not easy to diagnose. There is no single sign, symptom, or laboratory test that provides a definitive diagnosis of PID. Your doctor will make the diagnosis based on a physical examination and laboratory evaluations of cervical secretions. Sometimes the pediatrician may use an ultrasound or an examination of the abdominal and pelvic organs using a tiny flexible tube called a laparoscope. These methods can help distinguish PID from conditions with similar symptoms, such as  appendicitis , a ruptured ovarian cyst, or ectopic (tubal) pregnancies.\t Teenaged girls with PID should be tested for  syphilis  and  gonorrhea  as well as  Chlamydia ,  hepatitis B , and  HIV infections .\t Treatment\t Oral antibiotic treatment, typically with more than one medicine, is prescribed for most cases of PID. Patients should be rechecked within a few days to make sure the treatment is working.\t On occasion, especially when symptoms are severe or antibiotics need to be given intravenously rather than as pills, the patient must be hospitalized. Sexual partners within the previous 60 days of any girl with PID should be tested for chlamydial infection and gonorrhea, even if they have no symptoms.\t What Is the Prognosis?\t Antibiotic treatment successfully resolves most PID infections. As part of this treatment, the patient with PID should refrain from having sex until she and her sexual partner(s) have completed the course of the prescribed medications.\t Complications may develop even if PID is treated. Some teenaged girls and adult women experience recurrent infections and chronic pelvic pain. Females with PID have an increased risk (6 times more likely) of an ectopic or tubal pregnancy, as well as a higher risk of infertility because of scarring of the fallopian tubes.\t Prevention\t Teenagers should be instructed on how to practice  safe sex  to avoid STIs. Teenaged girls and young women can also lower their chances of developing PID by not using douches. Some research suggests that douching spreads bacteria into the upper genital tract.",

        "content": "By Susan Gillespie, MD, PhD, FAAP As a parent, it's important to keep communication open with your teen about their sexual health. If your teen is sexually active, they're at risk of getting sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ), also known as sexually transmitted diseases. STIs are common in the United States. They can be caused by bacteria such as chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis, along with viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ), human papillomavirus ( HPV ) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Getting tested for STIs is important when teens are sexually active. This is because STIs often have no signs or symptoms. Yet if they're left untreated, some of these infections can cause infertility and raise the  risk  of other infections. Routine testing is also important for pregnant people of all ages, since some STIs can cause stillbirth or lead to infection in the baby.  Here's what you need to know about diagnostic STI testing. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Human immunodeficiency virus attacks the immune system. When it's left untreated, HIV can result in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). There are three different tests used to diagnose HIV: An  antibody test  uses saliva or blood to check for HIV antibodies. Self-tests and most rapid tests are this type.  An  antigen/antibody test  checks for both an antigen called p24 and HIV antibodies. This test also uses blood.  A  nucleic acid test (NAT)  looks for HIV in the blood. NATs aren't used for routine screenings because they're expensive.  Recommended testing frequency for HIV The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends  at least one routine HIV screening for all teens  ages 15 years and older. Sexually active teens should get tested at least every year after their first screening. Teens that are higher risk may need to be tested more often. This includes males 13 years or older that have sex with other males; people whose sexual partner has HIV; and people who use injectable drugs. In addition, pregnant people should be tested for HIV at their first prenatal visit. They should be tested again during the third trimester if they live in communities with high rates of HIV infection. Testing helps identify HIV infection early to prevent congenital (present at birth) HIV infection. Thanks to routine HIV testing during pregnancy, congenital HIV infections are much less common that they once were. Chlamydia Chlamydia can affect both males and females. It's a fairly common STI. When it's left untreated, it can lead to severe damage to the female reproductive organs. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are the typical method of diagnosing chlamydia.  For females, your healthcare provider collects a sample from the vagina using a cotton swab. If preferred, your teen can do the swab themselves. Usually, for both males and females, urine can be used for this test. Sometimes, a sample collected from the cervix for females or the urethra for males can be used. If your teen has had oral and/or anal sex, they may need a swab taken from their throat and/or rectum.  Recommended testing frequency for chlamydia Sexually active females under 25 years should be tested every year.  In areas with a high rate of chlamydia among males, sexually active males under 25 years should also be tested every year. Ask your doctor about this.  Males who are 13 years or older that have sex with other males should be tested yearly too. Pregnant women of any age should be tested at their first prenatal visit. Gonorrhea Gonorrhea is another common STI, especially in people who are 15- to 24-years old. It affects both males and females. As with chlamydia, NAATs are most frequently used to diagnose gonorrhea. In fact, the two diseases are often tested at the same time. Cultures are sometimes used too. Usually, urine can be used for this test. If your teen has had oral and/or anal sex, they may need a swab taken from their throat and/or rectum. Sometimes, a sample from the cervix for females or the urethra for males is needed. Recommended testing frequency for gonorrhea Sexually active females under 25 years should be tested every year. Males who are 13 years or older that have sex with other males should be tested yearly too. Pregnant women of any age should be tested at their first prenatal visit. Syphilis Though it's easily treated with antibiotics, syphilis can cause serious health complications if it stays untreated. Doctors usually use a blood test to check for syphilis. Sometimes they use fluid from a syphilis sore instead. Recommended testing frequency for syphilis Males who are 13 years or older that have sex with other males should be tested every year. Testing for syphilis during pregnancy also is important to prevent congenital syphilis infections, which have been  rising sharply  in the United States.  Pregnant people of any age should be tested at their first prenatal visit. Testing should also be done twice during the third trimester, at 28 weeks gestation and at delivery, for pregnant people who live in communities with high rates of syphilis. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is caused by inflammation of a female's reproductive organs. Usually, this inflammation is caused by an untreated STI, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. Other infections that aren't STIs can cause it too. Only females can get PID. PID can be tricky to diagnose. There's not a specific test for it. Instead, doctors rely on what they find out from your child's Medical history Signs and symptoms Pelvic exam Blood and urine tests Ultrasound of the reproductive organs  Genital warts/human papillomavirus (HPV)  In the United States, human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common STI. There are many different kinds of HPV. For most people, an HPV infection goes away without treatment. In fact, people who have HPV usually don't know they do because they don't ever have symptoms. When HPV doesn't go away, it can cause genital warts or cervical and other cancers. This is how some people find out they're infected. The types of HPV that cause genital warts aren't the same as the ones that can cause cancer. If your teen has genital warts, your doctor will probably be able to diagnose HPV by looking at them. Sometimes, a sample is taken for lab testing. There are HPV tests for screening cervical cancer. But these aren't recommended for males, adolescents, or females under the age of 30 years. Genital herpes Genital herpes is another STI that's common in the United States. It can be caused by two types of viruses: herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).  Most people don't know they have herpes because they have no symptoms. Or their symptoms are so mild, they don't notice. But even when you don't have symptoms, you can still spread it. A herpes outbreak looks like blisters on the genitals. The blisters break open and turn into sores. These painful sores can take a week or longer to heal. Like HPV, your child's doctor may diagnose genital herpes just by looking at the sores. They may test a sample from the sores. In certain cases, your doctor might do a blood test to look for HSV antibodies.

        "content": "Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that are spread by sexual contact. While the incidence of reported STIs has actually declined in the United States in the last decade, the number of these infections in children and teenagers is still very high. About 25% of teenagers will have an STI before they graduate from high school.  Bacteria or viruses cause STIs. Any person who has sex with another person can get them. While STI symptoms can range from mild irritation and soreness to severe pain, many times there are no symptoms at all. The STI called chlamydia, for example, is generally symptom free or causes only mild symptoms. The diagnosis may not be made until complications develop.  Teenagers and young adults have higher rates of STIs than any other age group. One of the main reasons is that they frequently have unprotected sex. They are also biologically more likely to develop an infection. In addition, they may be less likely to use health care services that could give them information on how to protect themselves against STIs.  Prevention of STIs  The best way for teenagers to prevent STIs is to not have sexual intercourse. They should understand that when they choose to have sex, it is a decision that could affect them for the rest of their lives. Teenagers need to know that having sex could lead to pregnancy or an STI. Be certain that your teenager understands the risks. For example, make sure she knows that acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is a leading cause of death in people aged 15 to 24 years. The presence of other STIs such as chlamydia, herpes, gonorrhea, and syphilis can increase the chance of getting an HIV infection. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people with STIs have at least 2 to 5 times the risk of acquiring HIV through sexual contact.  Sexually transmitted infections can also cause pelvic inflammatory disease in women (an infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes) and epididymitis in men (inflammation of the coiled tube beside the testes). Complications from STIs can lead to infertility or an ectopic pregnancy (a fertilized egg that grows outside the womb). If a woman is pregnant, an STI can infect her baby.  Teenagers may face peer pressure to have sex. They need to understand that they can resist that pressure, and it’s OK to wait to have sex. Remind your teenager that saying “no” may not be easy at times, but saying “no” today is better than doing something she will regret tomorrow. Provide some guidance on what your teenager can say without hurting the feelings of her date, such as  “I like you a lot, but I’m just not ready to have sex.”  “You’re really fun to be with, and I wouldn’t want to ruin our relationship with sex.”  “You’re a great person, but sex isn’t how I prove I like someone.”  “I want to wait until I’m married to have sex.”  Also, let your teenager know that using alcohol or drugs can affect her ability to make a good decision. Drugs and alcohol make it more difficult to remain firm about the choice to wait to have sex. Even sexually active teenagers might try high-risk sexual behaviors while drinking alcohol or using drugs.  If a teenager starts having sex, it is important for her to practice safe sex. Safe sex means using a barrier method of birth control (eg, latex condoms) every time, beginning with the first sexual experience. Condoms are not a guarantee against STIs. The only way to truly prevent getting an STI is by not having sex at all. Condoms, however, can significantly reduce the risk of STIs and HIV. Talk to your teenager about how she can reduce her risk of STIs by limiting the number of lifetime sexual partners.  Anyone who is sexually active should get regular tests for STIs. Women should have an annual Pap smear. This is the first line of defense against cervical cancer and precancerous changes caused by papillomaviruses. Many doctors also recommend that every sexually active teenager be tested twice a year for gonorrhea and chlamydia and once a year for syphilis. Regular counseling about HIV is also important. Testing should be performed more frequently if symptoms such as abnormal vaginal discharge, irritation, or pain occur.  Using Condoms Properly Even though you may have clearly spoken with your teenager about the advantages of waiting to have sex, you need to talk with her about birth control. To prevent the transmission of STIs, teenagers need to be taught how to effectively use condoms. The condom should be made of latex. Laboratory studies have shown that HIV and other viruses can pass through the pores of natural membrane or lambskin condoms. Remind your teenager that other forms of birth control, including birth control pills, shots like Depo-Provera, and implants like Norplant, do not prevent STIs. Only latex condoms offer this protection.  Share the following guidance on correct male condom use with your teenager:  A new condom should be used every time your teenager has sex.  Condoms need to be handled with care to prevent tearing or cutting them with fingernails, teeth, or sharp instruments.  A condom should be placed on the penis after it is erect and before any genital contact.  Sufficient lubrication should be used during intercourse with a condom. If a lubricant is used on the outside of the condom, it should only be a water-based product such as K-Y Jelly, Astroglide, or Aqua-Lube. Oil-based lubricants such as petroleum jelly or body lotion can weaken the latex material.  During withdrawal, the condom should be held tightly against the base of the penis to keep it from slipping off. Withdrawal needs to be done while the penis is still erect.  A female condom, made as a lubricated polyurethane sheath, and called Reality, is also available. Follow instructions on the product packaging for proper use.  Is Your Teenager at Risk?  Studies show that if your teenager has one or more of the following characteristics, he or she has an increased chance of getting a sexually transmitted disease:  Multiple sexual partners  Sexual contact with one or more individuals with a known STI, either in the present or the past  Sexual intercourse with a new partner during the past 2 months  More than 2 sexual partners in the past 12 months  Symptoms or signs of an STI  Having been a patient in an STI clinic  No contraception or the use of non-barrier birth control (eg, birth control pills)  Male homosexual activity Homelessness  Use of injection drugs (eg, heroin)  Engaging in “survival sex” (ie, exchanging sex for money, food, drugs, or shelter)  Having spent time in a detention facility",

        "content": "Syphilis is an STI caused by Treponema pallidum bacteria. It is spread through direct contact with the sores or lesions that are part of the infection. When present between early infancy and puberty, syphilis may be a sign of sexual abuse. \t A pregnant woman with syphilis can spread the disease to her fetus through the placenta or during birth. It can result in stillbirth, a premature birth, and various birth defects. \t After infection, it takes about 3 weeks for the first signs of syphilis to appear. \t Signs and Symptoms \t The first signs of infection, primary syphilis, begin with painless sores (chancres) on the skin or the lining of the genitals. The sores will be visible when they’re present on the penis or a woman’s outer genitals, but they can also be hidden from view in a woman’s vagina or cervix or under a male’s foreskin. \t After a month or two without treatment, other signs and symptoms (secondary syphilis) will develop, including \t A skin rash that can occur anywhere on the body, but is usually present on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet \t Sores in the mouth and on the genitals or anus \t Swollen lymph glands \t Mild fever \t Sore throat \t Headache \t Fatigue \t Joint aches \t These symptoms may come and go over a period of 1 to 2 years. If the infection is still untreated, the organisms may spread throughout the body over time, damaging many organs and causing chronic conditions ranging from heart disorders to neurologic problems and even death in some cases (late syphilis). \t A newborn who acquires a syphilis infection from his mother often appears completely well. About half the time, however, he may have signs and symptoms such as a yellow-mucous nasal discharge (snuffles), rashes, skin ulcers, fluid retention, bone infection, fever, swollen spleen and liver, low red blood cell count (anemia), and jaundice (yellowing of the skin). These findings may be present at birth or develop within the initial months of life. \t When To Call Your Pediatrician \t If your teenager complains of having a sore in the genital area or other symptoms associated with syphilis, he should see his pediatrician. \t How Is The Diagnosis Made? \t The pediatrician will evaluate your child’s signs and symptoms and conduct blood tests that can identify the presence of syphilis. Secretions from sores can be examined under the microscope for the syphilis bacteria to provide further evidence of the infection. \t Your child and his sexual partner(s) should be tested for syphilis as well as other STIs such as gonorrhea and chlamydial, hepatitis B, and HIV infections. If necessary, his partner(s) should be treated. \t All pregnant women should receive a blood test for syphilis early in their pregnancies. Treatment of an infected pregnant woman will also treat the developing baby. \t Treatment \t Most often, syphilis is treated with penicillin given by a shot. This treatment has been proven effective in teenagers and adults as well as in pregnant women and newborns. \t What Is The Prognosis? \t The treatment of syphilis with penicillin can resolve the infection. Patients should have blood tests to confirm that the infectious bacteria have been eliminated. \t Prevention \t Teenagers should be instructed on how to practice safe sex to avoid STIs.",

Infected children and adolescents should receive access to special education and other related services (including home instruction) if their disease progresses and the need arise. The confidentiality of a child or adolescent’s HIV-infection status should be respected, with disclosure given only with the consent of the parent(s) or legal guardian(s).  HIV/AIDS in sports:  All HIV-infected children and adolescents should be encouraged to participate in      sports  as much as their health will allow.

        "content": "​Sunny days and starlit evenings spent playing, splashing and exploring can leave kids with more than warm summertime memories. Balmy weather also can lead to itchy, irritated skin.\t Check out the list from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to see how you can help prevent, identify and soothe these common summertime skin rashes. 1. Heat rash\t   Heat rash  ( also known as prickly heat or miliaria)  is seen most often in babies and young children when sweat gland pores become blocked and perspiration can't escape. The rash looks like patches of small pink or red bumps or blisters under clothing or spots where skin tends to fold—on the neck, elbows, armpits, or thighs—although heat rash can occur on other covered areas.  What parents can do:\t Keep kids cool.  Dress your child in clothing that keeps the skin cool and dry. If possible, use fans and air conditioning to avoid overheating.\t Pay attention to hot spots.  Wash areas of the skin that stay wet with sweat, urine, or drool with cool water. Pat them dry.\t Keep skin bare.  Leave areas open to air without clothing. Do not apply skin ointments. 2. Poison ivy & other plant rashes\t Many children get a burning, intensely itchy rash where their skin touches plants—such as    poison ivy ,    poison oak ,    sumac —containing a sticky oil called   \t urushiol . An allergic skin reaction causes redness, swelling and blisters. Other plants—such as    wild parsnip ,    giant hogweed  and citrus—contain chemicals that make skin hypersensitive to sunlight and cause a    phytopho​toder​​matitis rash .​ What parents can do:\t Prevent exposure . Teach your child what these plants look like and how to avoid them. Both poison ivy and poison oak have shiny green leaves that grow three to a stem, so you might share the rhyme:    \"Leaves of three, let them be.\"  The sumac shrub has stems that contain 7-13 leaves arranged in pairs, while wild parsnip and giant hogweed have clusters of small, flat-topped yellow and white flowers. If you have younger children, inspect the parks they play in and have rash-causing plants removed.  \t Wash and trim.  If your child comes into contact with these plants, wash all of their clothes and shoes in soap and water. Also, wash the area of the skin that was exposed with soap and water for at least 10 minutes after the plant or the oil is touched. To discourage scratching and further damage to the skin, keep your child's fingernails trimmed. This will also prevent the rash from spreading if there is still a small amount of oil under the fingernails. \t Soothing salves.  If the rash is mild, apply calamine lotion to cut down on the itching. Avoid ointments containing anesthetics or antihistamines—they can cause allergic reactions themselves. Another good option to reduce skin inflammation is 1% hydrocortisone cream.\t Talk with your pediatrician.  While mild cases can be treated at home, talk with your pediatrician if your child is especially uncomfortable, the rash is severe and/or isn't going away, if the rash is on your child's face or groin area, or if you notice signs of infection  (such as fever, redness, swelling beyond the poison ivy or oak lesions).   3. Eczema\t   Eczema\t (also called atopic dermatitis or AD)  is a chronic condition common in children that causes patches of dry, scaly red skin and tends to flare up during colder months when there's less moisture in the air. But dryness caused by air conditioning and pressurized planes during summer travel can cause problems, too. Overheating, sweating and chlorine in swimming pools also can trigger eczema.  What parents can do:\t Moisturize.  Apply fragrance-free creams or ointments at least once a day or more often if needed. After a bath or swimming, gently pat your child's skin with a towel and then apply moisturizer to their damp skin.\t Dress wisely.  Choose clothing made of soft, breathable fabrics like cotton when possible. Wash clothes in a detergent free of irritants such as perfumes and dyes.\t Don't scratch.  Keep your child's fingernails short and smooth, and remind them not to scratch. Scratching can make the rash worse and lead to infection. \t Talk with your pediatrician.  Ask your child's pediatrician if allergies, sometimes triggered by trees and plants that bloom during summer, could be a cause of the eczema. Your child's pediatrician may recommend medicines to help your child feel better and to keep the symptoms of eczema under control.  4. Insect bites & stings \t   Insects such as bees, wasps, mosquitos, fire ants and ticks can cause itching and minor discomfort where they prick the skin. For some children, insect bites and stings can cause a severe allergic reaction called    anaphylaxis —which includes a rash or    hives  and life-threatening symptoms such as airway swelling.    (For children with a known allergy to insect bites and stings, it is important to have \t   anaphylaxis emergency care plan  in place).  Other times, diseases spread by insects such as    Lyme Disease ,    Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever  and    Zika Virus  can cause rashes and other health problems.  What parents can do: \t Avoidance.  When spending time outdoors, avoid scented soaps and shampoos and brightly colored clothing—they can attract insects. If possible, steer clear of areas where insects nest and gather (such as stagnant pools of water, uncovered food and blooming flowers).\t Use    insect repellent .  Products with DEET can be used on the skin, but look for family-friendly products. Wash the insect repellent off with soap and water when your child returns indoors. \t Cover up.  When in wooded areas or in or near tall grass, stay on cleared trails as much as possible. Have your child wear a long-sleeved shirt, pants and hat. Avoid wearing sandals in an area where ticks may live.\t Look closely.  Wear light-colored clothing to make it easier to spot ticks. After coming indoors, check for ticks on your child's skin—they often hide behind the ears or along the hairline. \t Remove stingers and ticks.  To remove a visible stinger from skin, gently scrape it off horizontally with a credit card or your fingernail. If you find a tick, gently grasp it with fine-tipped tweezers as close to the skin as possible. Without squeezing the tick's body, slowly pull it away from the skin. ( See \t   How To Remove A Tick  for more information.)\t Clean the skin.  After the stinger or tick is out, clean the bitten area with rubbing alcohol or other first aid ointment.\t Treat swelling.  Apply a cold compress or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes.\t Help relieve the itch.  Applying ice, along with calamine lotion or 1% hydrocortisone cream, can also help relieve itching.  5. Impetigo\t Impetigo  is a bacterial skin infection that's more common during hot, humid weather. It causes a rash that may have fluid-filled blisters or an oozing rash covered by crusted yellow scabs. Impetigo is more likely to develop where there is a break in the skin, like around insect bites.  What parents can do:\t Clean and cover.  Clean the infected area with soap and water. Cover the infected area loosely to help prevent contact that would spread the infection to others or to other parts of the body. Wash your own hands well after treating your child's sores. \t Avoid scratching . Trim your child's fingernails and discourage scratching. A child can spread the infection to other parts of their body by scratching. You can cover the rash loosely with a bandage to discourage your child from touching the rash, but make sure air can flow through so the skin can heal.\t Talk with your pediatrician . While mild cases may respond to over-the-counter antibiotics such as bacitracin or bacitracin-polymyxin, impetigo is usually treated with prescription antibiotics—either a skin cream or oral medication. Your pediatrician may order a skin culture (test of your child's skin) to determine which bacteria are causing the rash.  6. Swimmer's itch\t   Swimmer's itch\t (also called clam digger's itch or cercarial dermatitis ) may appear after playing in bodies of water where microscopic parasites are released by infected snails. The rash is caused by an allergic reaction to the parasites, most often found in shallow, warmer water near the shoreline where children tend to stay. The parasites burrow into skin, and cause tiny reddish, raised spots on skin not covered by the swimsuit to appear. Welts and blisters may also form.  What parents can do:\t Be aware.  Don't swim near or wade in marshy areas where snails are commonly found. Try not to attract birds (by feeding them, for example) where your family swims. Birds may eat the snails and spread the parasites in the water. \t Shower or towel dry.  Shower or briskly rub the skin with a towel immediately after getting out of the water. The parasites start to burrow when the water on skin begins evaporating. If your skin child's skin stings with rubbing—and the rash appears under the swimsuit—they may instead have   \t Seabather's Eruption  from stinging larvae of sea critters such as jellyfish or sea anemone. Stop rubbing and shower instead.\t Don't scratch.  Trim your child's fingernails and discourage scratching. Home treatments such cool compresses on the affected areas, Epsom salt or oatmeal baths or baking soda paste may help to relieve the discomfort. If itching is severe, talk with your child's pediatrician. They may suggest prescription-strength lotions or creams to reduce your child's symptoms.  7. Cutaneous larva migrans (sandworms)\t Sandworms may be present in sand contaminated with feces from pets or stray animals. When a child stands or sits in contaminated sand on a beach or in a sandbox, the worms may burrow under the skin, usually around the feet or buttocks. Lines of itchy, reddish rash known as a   \t creeping eruption   appear as the worms move under the skin, up to a few centimeters a day. The condition is more common subtropical and tropical areas such as the Caribbean, as well as parts of the southwestern United States. What parents can do:\t Keep shoes on.  Don't let your child play on beaches where people walk their dogs. If your family goes on an outing to a designated pet-friendly beach, make sure your child keeps shoes on and doesn't sit in the sand without a blanket or towel.\t Talk with your pediatrician.  Your pediatrician can prescribe anti-parasitic medications such as albendazole or ivermectin to treat the rash. Without treatment, the larvae usually will die off in 5 to 6 weeks. Your pediatrician may suggest a cream to help relieve itching. 8. Folliculitis (hot tub rash)\t Folliculitis ( hot tub rash ) is an itchy, pimply rash that occurs when bacteria in unclean pools and hot tubs gets into hair follicles on the skin. The area where hairs grow from the skin becomes infected and inflamed, sometimes forming small, pus-filled blisters. A similar rash may come from wearing a damp swimsuit that wasn't washed and dried well after previous use. Hot rub rash typically starts 12-48 hours after being in a hot tub. What parents can do:\t Avoid dirty pools.  If you're unsure whether the acid and chlorine levels are properly controlled in a heated pool, don't allow your child to go in. \t Don't allow young children in spas or hot tubs.  In addition to the    risk for drowning  and overheating, young children are also at higher risk of bacterial skin infection because they tend to spend more time in the water than teens or adults. \t Talk with your pediatrician.  Hot tub rash usually clears up without medical treatment. In the meantime, warm compresses and an over-the-counter anti-itch cream recommended by your pediatrician can help your child be more comfortable. If your child's rash lasts more than a few days, talk with your pediatrician.  9. Molluscum virus \t   Molluscum contagiosum  is a viral infection that causes pearly bumps on the skin on a child's chest, back, arms or legs. The dome-shaped bumps, also known as \"water warts,\" may have a dimple in the center. The    poxvirus  that causes the bumps is more common in hot, humid climates.    What parents can do: \t Wait it out.  In most cases, molluscum contagiosum does not need treatment. In fact, the U.S, Food & Drug Agency ( FDA ) advises against using products marketed to treat molluscum; none are FDA-approved, and they can cause bad reactions. The bumps usually will go away on their own in 6 to 12 months.\t Stop the spread.  A child with molluscum contagiosum should not share towels, bedding, or clothing with others to avoid spreading the virus. The bumps are contagious as long as they are present.\t Avoid scratching.  Scratching the bumps can spread the virus and cause a second, bacterial infection where the skin is open.  10. Juvenile plantar dermatosis (sweaty sock syndrome)\t A smooth, reddened rash on your child's feet, sometimes with peeling, cracking skin or scaly skin, could be from a condition called juvenile plantar dermatosis (sweaty sock syndrome). It happens when feet get wet and then dry quickly, again and again—like when shoes are taken on and off coming in and out of the house during summer. What parents can do:\t Breathable footwear.  Reduce how often the feet go from wet to dry quickly by having your child wear open or more breathable footwear made of materials like mesh or cotton (such as water shoes) and/or thicker more absorbent socks. \t Apply ointment . Applying moisturizing ointment or an over-the-counter steroid cream to the affected areas of your child's foot immediately after taking shoes off or getting out of water can help. If the condition does not improve, or if you notice any sign of infection where your child's skin is cracking, talk to your pediatrician.  11. Tinea (ringworm)\t Despite having \"worm\" in its misleading name, tinea ( ringworm ) is an infection caused by a fungus that thrives in warm, damp conditions. It is similar to    athlete's foot and jock itch  and can appear on a child's scalp or other parts of the body. It's called ringworm because the rash from the infection tends to form round or oval spots that become smooth in the center as they grow while the border remains red and scaly. The fungus can spread quickly among student athletes, especially during sweaty, summertime practices and games, when they share sports equipment and locker rooms.  What parents can do:\t Stop the spread . Check and treat any pets that may have the fungus—look for scaling, itchy, hairless areas on their fur. Family members, playmates, or schoolmates who show symptoms also should be treated. Do not allow your child to share combs, brushes, hair clips, barrettes or hats. Make sure mats used in sports like wrestling and gymnastics are properly disinfected after use.\t Talk with your pediatrician . A single ringworm patch on the body can be treated with an over-the-counter cream recommended by your pediatrician. If there are any patches on the scalp or more than one on the body, or if the rash is getting worse while being treated, your pediatrician may prescribe a stronger medication and special shampoo.  12. Hand, foot & mouth disease\t Many parents assume virus season winds down after winter. But some viral illnesses, such as    hand, foot, and mouth disease , are more common during summer and early fall. Outbreaks are most common in younger children and can spread in child care centers, preschools, and summer camps. Caused by    Enterovirus coxsackie , the illness starts with a fever, sore throat, and runny nose—much like the    common cold —but then a rash with tiny blisters may appear on any or all the following places on the body:  In the mouth    (inner cheeks, gums, sides of the tongue or back of the mouth) Fingers or palms of hands Soles of feet Buttocks  Symptoms are the worst in the first few days, but they are usually gone within a week. Peeling skin on the fingers, toes, and nails may begin after a week or two, but it is harmless. Parents of children with a history of atopic dermatitis or eczema should be aware that their children may be prone to a more severe outbreak. What parents can do:\t Monitor symptoms.  Be sure to call your pediatrician if your child's fever lasts more than 3 days or if he or she is not drinking fluids. If symptoms are severe, your pediatrician may collect samples from your child's throat for lab testing.\t Ease the pain.  For fever and pain, the pediatrician may also recommend    acetaminophen  or    ibuprofen . Liquid mouth-soothing remedies may be useful to alleviate mouth ulcer pain. Do not use regular mouthwashes, because they sting.\t Avoid dehydration:  Children with hand, foot, and mouth disease need to drink plenty of fluids. Call your pediatrician or go to the ER if you suspect your child is dehydrated.    See \t   Signs of Dehydration in Infants & Children  for more information.  \t Inform others.  Tell child care providers and playmates' parents to watch for symptoms of the illness. Children with hand, foot, and mouth disease may spread the virus through the respiratory tract (nose, mouth and lungs) for 1-3 weeks, and in the stool for weeks to months after the infection starts. Once a child's fever has gone away and they feel better, there is no need to keep them home unless there are still open and oozing blisters.    See \t   When to Keep Your Child Home from Child Care  for more information. Remember Protecting your child's skin is a year-round concern, but it's especially important in the summer months when so much skin is exposed and vulnerable. Fortunately, many summertime rashes clear up quickly on their own.  Be sure to talk with your pediatrician about any rash that you're unsure about—especially if you don't know what caused it, if it is making your child feel miserable or doesn't clear up quickly, or if it shows signs of infection or is accompanied by any shortness of breath.

        "content": "By: Sean Reynolds MB, BCh, BAO & Matthew Mahoney, DO Have you noticed your little one scratching their bottom? Anal itching (pruritus ani) is common among children. This uncomfortable condition can have a variety of causes. Thankfully, most of these causes are easily treatable. Here are a few of the most common reasons for anal itching in kids and how they're treated. Pinworms The most common cause of anal itching is    pinworms . Around 20% of all children in the United States will be affected by pinworms at some time in their lives.  What are pinworms? Pinworms are very small parasites that can live in the intestines of humans. They are the most common worm infection in the United States. Fortunately, pinworms do not cause intestinal problems or transmit any other germs or infections. But pinworms can cause intense itching when they crawl out of the intestine to lay their eggs. This mostly happens at night. What symptoms do pinworms cause?  Most children with pinworms have intense itching of the perianal (around the anus) area. This is worse at night or in the early morning. That's because pinworms tend to emerge from the anus and lay their eggs on the outside skin when the child is asleep. Some children with pinworms have no symptoms. How does someone get pinworms?  Pinworms are very contagious and often spread from child to child.  Pinworm infections spread when a child ingests microscopic pinworm eggs. This usually happens when a child who is infected gets pinworm eggs on their hands while using the toilet. Then, they touch surfaces shared by others. Examples of shared surfaces where pinworm eggs can spread include toys, bedding, clothing, food, toilet seats, doorknobs and faucet handles. How are pinworms diagnosed in children? The information you share about how your child is feeling and behaving can help the doctor diagnose pinworms. Sometimes, pinworms can be seen on the perianal skin around 2-3 hours after the child falls asleep. The pinworms look like a moving white thread that is around ¼ inch long. Stool tests are not useful as worms and eggs are not typically passed in stool. What is the treatment for pinworms?  Thankfully, the treatment for pinworms is relatively simple. Your doctor will recommend a medicine for your child to swallow one time, and then to take again 2 weeks later. All the children in your home should be treated at the same time, even if the others are not itching. The sheets, blankets, towels and clothing should be washed in hot water and dried in the dryer on a hot setting. Try not to shake items—this will scatter the eggs. It usually takes around one week before the itching stops. Other common causes of anal itching in children Perianal strep  Just as children can get a    strep throat infection , they can also get a strep infection of the skin around the anus. Perianal step ( A Streptococcus ) infection is common in children between    6 months  and 10 years old. It leads to a rash, itching and sometimes pain.  The perianal rash usually looks like a bright red ring around the anus. Perianal strep is diagnosed with a skin swab that is sent to the lab, similar to how strep throat is diagnosed. This test can be done by any medical provider. Perianal strep infection is treated with antibiotic medicine taken by mouth.  Skin irritation Skin irritation is another common cause of anal itch. The cause for the irritation can be many things, Examples include tight clothing, poor toilet hygiene or products like packaged wipes, bubble bath, soaps or cleaning products.  When the skin gets irritated, it gets itchy. Then, scratching irritates the skin more. This leads to more itching. It's called the itch/scratch cycle. The best way to help skin irritation around the anus is to prevent it from happening in the first place. Avoid children's products that contain fragrance, like bubble bath and scented soaps. Small children should also get help to wipe the area clean after toileting. For children who already have skin irritation, it helps to wipe after toileting with a wet washcloth instead of dry toilet paper. This will be less irritating and help healing. Packaged, pre-moistened wipes can be convenient, but some children will develop a rash to the ingredients in these products, too. Protecting the affected skin with petrolatum ointment or zinc oxide paste (the ingredient in many    diaper rash  creams) is a good first treatment. If the problem doesn't improve, talk with your child's doctor for guidance about additional treatments.

        "content": "By: Amy Lynn Stockhausen, MD, FAAP Winter doesn't have to worsen your child's dry skin. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has tips to help ease those dry, itchy patches that sometimes come with dry winter weather. In general, children have thinner, more delicate skin than adults do. Because of this, it may lose moisture more easily. Winter dryness can be especially tough for children with atopic dermatitis, a form of    eczema .  But there are other factors that play into dry winter skin. With a few changes to your child's daily routine, dry skin can be managed during the winter and throughout the year.  Bath Time Changing bath time routines can have some of the biggest impacts on improving dry, itchy skin:\t   Short baths are best.  Baths are better than showers at helping to keep dry skin hydrated. But baths that are too long can have the opposite effect. The AAP suggests limiting    bath time  to less than 10 minutes.\t Stay cool.  Keep the water temperature lukewarm. Hot water may dry out the skin and also activates nerve endings, which become more sensitive, increasing the urge to scratch at the skin.\t Avoid bubble baths & foamy, scented soaps.  Not only do children tend to spend more time in the water with bubbles, the products often contain detergents that can strip skin of natural oils and make it more prone to dryness. In addition, fragrances and other chemicals in these products can irritate skin.\t Dry off without drying out.  When done bathing, pat dry with a soft cotton towel. Do not rub as it strips more oils from the skin surface and irritates sensitive skin and nerve endings as well. Immediately after bathing, apply a good moisturizer head-to-toe (see below).  Soaps & Moisturizers When it comes to soap and moisturizers, not all are the same. Here are a few things to consider as you look at products for dry skin: Traditional soap vs. non-soap.  Non-soap cleansers are less drying and often recommended for sensitive and dry skin. Be sure whatever soap you use is fragrance-free, deodorant-free and hypoallergenic. Avoid using antibacterial soaps for general bathing, since they may irritate the skin.\t Choose the right moisturizer.  Moisturizing is an important part of soothing dry, winter skin. Moisturizers come in creams, lotions and ointments.\t \t \t Ointments contain the most oils. They are very helpful for extremely dry, irritated areas. In addition, they do not contain preservatives and won't sting or burn the skin when applied.\t    Creams are also a good option for dry skin because they contain a lot of oils, which are good at sealing moisture into the skin.\t   Lotions are thinner and lighter than other moisturizers. They contain fewer oils but more water. Lotions may be helpful in warmer months or for those whose skin is not as dry.    \t   Apply to damp skin.  Since they seal in moisture, it's best to use    moisturizers  right after showering or bathing while skin is still damp and moist. Misting the skin with a little water before using a moisturizer is a good way to hydrate the skin when it's not bath time. Use a moisturizer at least twice a day, even when skin is not irritated. Consistent, daily use can lower the chance of rashes and itches developing. \t Cover up.  Putting on cotton-based clothing right after using a moisturizer can help protect the skin, keep it from rubbing off and help seal in moisture. Beyond the skin – laundry, linens & humidifiers After bathing, moisturizing and getting dressed, here are some other ways minor changes can make a big difference: \t Laundry products.  Consider using \"free and clear\" laundry detergents with no fragrances, dyes or perfumes. Look for products for sensitive skin, which are less likely to have irritants that trigger itching. Avoid using dryer sheets or fabric softeners. These may contain chemicals, fragrances and oils that can irritate sensitive skin.\t Skin-friendly fabric.  Consider cotton or bamboo sheets and pillowcases and they tend to be soft, breathe well and be less irritating to the skin. Consider cotton clothing as well. It can keep sweat from building up on the skin, which causes irritation. Synthetic fabrics can be rougher and tend to trap heat, which can cause sweating and irritation. Wash all new clothing before wearing to remove any finishing chemicals or dyes.\t Climate control.  Consider taking steps to add moisture to your environment. Forced-air heating in winter creates dry air and low humidity in the home. In turn, dry air creates dry skin. A whole house humidifier can help your overall environment remain around 40% humidity. If that's not an option, a console or    cool-mist room humidifier  can be another option to add moisture to the air. When to call your pediatrician If your child still has dry, irritated skin after making these changes, talk with your pediatrician. Additional steps that can be taken, including possible prescription medication, to ease the problem.

        "content": "Participating in  sports  can boost a child's physical and mental health in so many ways. But for kids with  eczema , exercise can also worsen their symptoms or lead to eczema flare-ups. The good news: preparing your child with the proper clothing, hydration and moisturizing routine can prevent or minimize eczema flare-ups during sports. Exercise & eczema flares: what's the connection? Sudden body temperature changes and sweating are often a part of physical activity. These changes can cause eczema flare-ups. Physical activity can also dry out the skin through the loss of fluids. The sodium in sweat can further dehydrate the skin as well as sting and irritate it.    How to minimize eczema flare-ups while playing sports During a game: sharing eczema tips with coaches During a game or practice, there are ways you can help your child minimize skin irritation and dehydration. Share these tips with your child's coaches. Working together, you can keep your child's skin healthy and hydrated and minimize flare-ups. Keep  hydrated  with water breaks. Take frequent cooling breaks. Gently pat away sweat with clean towels. Use cooling cloths or towels as needed. They are designed to provide a cooling effect when wet. Wipe off shared equipment before use to prevent bacteria transfer. During flare-ups, your child may need to sit out a game, class or event. Keeping uniforms & workout clothing eczema-friendly When dressing your child for physical activity, choose clothing that decreases sweat and irritation. Here are some tips. Remove tags. You can also buy clothing with seamless tags or cover tags with silk material. Order clothing a size up for a looser fit. Try moisture-wicking fabric designed to wick sweat away from the skin and dry quickly. Wicking fabrics help prevent clogged pores and cool down the overall body temperature. You may have to test out different fabrics to see which one works best for your child and the specific activity. Always wash new uniforms and workout clothing before your child wears them. Check the clothing label for laundry care instructions. Use fragrance-free detergents.  Dry clothing in the dryer. Clothing may feel softer when dried in the dryer. However, using the dryer is not recommended for all clothing. Check the clothing label for laundry care instructions.  Wear a slightly damp shirt (dampened with cold water) during physical activity to help prevent overheating. Keep protective equipment, like  helmets , clean and dry when not in use. Follow the manufacturer's directions on how to clean and store equipment. Irritation from equipment rubbing against the skin can be tough to avoid, but these steps can help: Before and after play keep the skin barrier healthy with daily moisturizing; during and after play, manage sweat. Moisturizing & protecting skin from sunburn Always  moisturize  after bathing and gently towel-drying the skin. If medicine is needed, apply it before the moisturizer.  If the moisturizer does not include  sunscreen , also apply a broad-spectrum, oil-free, water-resistant sunscreen of at least sun protection factor (SPF) 15 (up to SPF 50). An SPF of 15 or 30 should be fine for most people; the American Academy of Dermatology recommends an SPF of at least 30. More research studies are needed to test if sunscreen with more than SPF 50 offers any extra protection. Managing sweat After a game or other physical activity, it is important to remove wet or sweaty clothes as quickly as possible. If there are showers available, a short lukewarm shower will quickly rinse away sweat and bacteria.  If showering right away is not an option, a damp washcloth or  noncomedogenic  wipe can be used to cleanse the skin until your child takes a bath at home. These wipes and cleansers, typically used in makeup removal, do not clog pores and help keep the skin hydrated. Once sweat and dirt are removed, reapply moisturizers. Then, change into fresh, clean clothing. After each use, clean clothing and equipment to remove dead skin cells, bacteria and oils. Check the clothing and product labels for laundry care and cleaning instructions. To minimize underarm wetness,  antiperspirant or deodorant  with antiperspirant may be used.  Planning ahead If your child is on a sports team or you have any special concerns, having a plan may be useful. For example: Discuss your child's eczema treatment and special considerations with coaches, teachers and activity leaders. Inform them of your child's needs, including extra water and cooling breaks. Pack a to-go bag of travel-sized toiletries of your child's skin and body care products. Include moisturizer, face and body wash, and shampoo, unless you know that products available at schools won't irritate your child's skin. Also, if needed, pack antiperspirant or deodorant with antiperspirant, cleansing wipes, a cooling cloth or towel, towels, a change of clothes and medicines.  What about swimming with eczema? Swimming  with eczema is different for everyone, since pools can have different effects on skin. Some children prefer chlorinated  pools , while others prefer to swim in  open water .  For some children, the chlorine in the pool is soothing, like a  diluted bleach bath . For others, the chlorine can sting and irritate sensitive skin. Your child may prefer to swim in the open water of a freshwater pond or saltwater lake. If your child is going to the swimming pool, keep in mind that pool chemicals can be drying. Proper moisturizing beforehand is needed.  Before a trip to the pool, apply a layer of moisturizer or a thick emollient followed by sunscreen to protect the skin. Directly after swimming, clean the body with a gentle cleanser and rinse in warm water. Pat the skin mostly dry with a clean towel. While the skin is slightly damp, apply medicated ointment, if needed, and a layer of moisturizer.  Swimming in a pool, a lake, or other open water is an individual choice, but avoid immersing skin that has open sores or is weepy should be avoided. Staying active Sports activities provide physical and emotional benefits that children with eczema don't have to miss. By following these tips, your child can safely participate in physical education classes, play on a sports team or swim in swimming pools. Remember, managing the symptoms before, during and after physical activity is key. More information\t How to Treat & Control Eczema Rashes in Children",

        "content": "By: Sarah Stein, MD, FAAD, FAAP   At least one in 10 children have    eczema  (also called    atopic dermatitis ). Eczema is an ongoing skin problem that causes dry, red, itchy skin. Children with eczema have more sensitive skin than other people. Here's what parents need to know about the condition.  What causes eczema?  Eczema is caused by problems with the skin barrier. Many children with eczema do not have enough of a special protein called \"filaggrin\" in the outer layer of skin. Filaggrin helps skin form a strong barrier between the body and the environment. Skin with too little of this protein has a harder time holding in water and keeping out bacteria and environmental irritants.  Both a person's genes and their environment play a role in eczema. It often runs in families. Eczema tends to occur with other    allergic conditions  such as asthma and allergic rhinitis (hay fever and seasonal allergies). Many children with eczema also have    food allergies , but foods themselves do not cause eczema. \t \t  What does eczema look like?  Eczema rashes can be different for each child. They can be all over the body or in just a few spots. The eczema rash often worsens at times (called \"exacerbations\" or \"flares\") and then gets better (called \"remissions\"). Where the rashes develop may change over time: \t In babies , eczema usually starts on the scalp and face. Red, dry rashes may show up on the cheeks, forehead, and around the mouth. Eczema usually does not develop in the diaper area. \t In young school-aged children , the eczema rash is often in the elbow creases, on the backs of the knees, on the neck, and around the eyes.  Is eczema contagious?  No. Children with eczema are more prone to skin infections, but    eczema is NOT contagious.  The infections that children with eczema tend to get are often from germs that usually live harmlessly on everyone's skin. These germs cause more problems for children with eczema because their skin doesn't always have a strong barrier to keep them out.  How do I know if my child's skin is infected?  Occasionally bacterial or viral infections develop on top of eczema rashes.    Talk to your doctor if you see yellow or honey-colored crusting and scabbing, weepy or oozy skin, blisters or pus bumps or rash that is not getting better even with the usual treatments.    Do children outgrow eczema?  For some children, eczema starts to go away by age 4. However, some children may continue to have dry, sensitive skin as they grow up. It is hard to predict which children will outgrow the condition and which ones will have eczema as adults.  Remember  Eczema can be frustrating for children and their parents, especially when the itching makes it difficult to sleep. Your pediatrician and pediatric dermatologist can help you manage your child's eczema symptoms with a good treatment plan and a healthy skin maintenance routine.

        "content": "By: S. Elizabeth Williams, MD, MPH, FAAP If your child has bright red cheeks but has not been playing outdoors in the cold, it might be fifth disease. This common childhood illness got its name because it was the fifth disease on a historical list of six common    skin rash  illnesses in children. It is caused by a virus called parvovirus B19, which is also known as    Erythema infectiosum .  The illness usually is not serious. Symptoms of fifth disease may include a mild rash,    fever , runny nose, muscle aches and a headache. Outbreaks in school-aged children are most common in late winter and early spring. How do I know if my child has fifth disease?  Fifth disease starts off like many other viral infections, so it can be hard to know for sure if your child has it. Your doctor will look at the rash and may do blood tests to check for antibodies to the virus.  Parvovirus rash The rash is the best clue. A bright red rash that first appears is what is known as the \"slapped cheek\" rash. Sometimes another rash that looks lacy appears a few days later. The second rash often starts on the trunk and spreads to the arms, legs, and even the soles of the feet. It may be itchy but usually goes away after about a week.  Even after a child is better, the rash can reappear weeks or months later when your child is hot (during exercise, bathing, etc.). How does fifth disease spread? Fifth disease spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets.  Symptoms  usually show up 4 to 14 days after being exposed to the virus, with the slapped-cheek rash showing up about 4 to 21 days after your child gets infected.  A child is most contagious before the rash appears and is not contagious after the rash appears. Once a person has fifth disease, they usually cannot get it again.  Good    hand hygiene  is the best way to prevent the spread of fifth disease in    school, child care , and at home. Remind children to throw away used tissues and make sure that surfaces and objects that children touch are cleaned and sanitized regularly. When can my child go back to school or child care?  When you see a rash, your child is no longer contagious. Fifth disease is often mild and goes away with some rest and recovery at home. Your doctor may suggest acetaminophen for fever, aches or pain.  Does the virus ever cause serious problems? Yes. The virus can affect the way the body makes red blood cells, the cells that carry oxygen through the body. This puts children who have a blood disorder or weak immune system at serious risk if they catch the virus.  The virus can also cause red blood cell counts to drop so low that a blood transfusion is needed. Children with    cancer such as leukemia , HIV infection, and certain types of anemia (low red blood cell counts) such as from    sickle cell disease , often must go to the hospital if they catch fifth disease. If your child has any of these conditions, check with your doctor at the first sign of the rash. What if I get fifth disease when I am pregnant? Most times, fifth disease does not cause problems for pregnant women and their babies. Rarely, serious problems can occur if the virus gets passed on and makes it hard for the fetus to make red blood cells. This can lead to severe anemia that causes    hydrops fetalis , a buildup of fluid that can lead to heart failure or death.  Pregnant women with fifth disease may need to have the following    tests : Ultrasound to see if the baby is having problems. Amniocentesis, a procedure to take amniotic fluid from the womb. Cordocentesis, a procedure to check umbilical cord blood and find out how severe your baby's anemia is. Usually, the anemia is not severe. If you or your child is diagnosed with fifth disease, you should let any pregnant women know who may have been exposed. Can fifth disease be confused with another rash? There are many other skin rash illnesses, but not all of them look the same. Some--like    measles , rubella ( German measles ), and chicken pox ( varicella )--are    easy to prevent  if your child is up to date on immunizations.  Viruses also are to blame for common childhood skin rashes like    hand, foot, and mouth disease ,    roseola  and even    cold sores . When should I call my child's doctor? If you think your child may have fifth disease, it's okay to    call your pediatrician  with questions. Call right away if your child's symptoms seem to be getting worse instead of better, you notice joint swelling, your child has chronic anemia, or your child looks very pale.

        "content": "​​Gangrene describes the death of infected tissue. This tissue damage may be caused by the Clostridium bacterium—most commonly, Clostridium perfringens. When this is the case, the disease is called gas gangrene or clostridial myonecrosis (myo refers to muscle, and necrosis to death). It is a rare but life-threatening      infection  that occurs when these bacteria multiple and produce toxins, causing tissue injury. This condition is frequently associated with a recent surgical wound or trauma. Signs and Symptoms If gas gangrene develops in your child, it will probably begin with pain at the site of the existing wound. Next, your youngster may experience fluid buildup (edema), tenderness, and a worsening of the pain. Her heart rate may increase (tachycardia), along with rapid breathing, sweating, paleness, and      fever . If untreated, her condition can get worse and lead to a lowering of blood pressure to dangerous levels (hypotension), kidney failure, an impairment of her mental status, and shock. The incubation period from the time of infection to the appearance of symptoms can be as short as 6 hours and as long as 3 weeks. In most cases, the period is 2 to 4 days. When to Call Your Pediatrician If there are signs of infection, particularly if associated with a skin wound, contact your pediatrician immediately. How Is the Diagnosis Made? Your doctor will diagnose gas gangrene based on your child's symptoms, along with laboratory tests to find  Clostridium  bacteria such as cultures and smears of a blood sample and secretions from the infected area. ​Treatment\t   Gas gangrene must be treated immediately by:\t Surgically removing the dead and infected tissue Administering penicillin intravenously Managing shock and other complications Possibly treating the patient in a high-pressure oxygen chamber, although the effectiveness of this approach has not been proven\t   What Is the Prognosis?\t   Unless properly treated, gas gangrene can become progressively worse, leading to the spread of the infection throughout the body (sepsis) and often death within hours.   Prevention If your child has a      skin injury , wash the area with soap and water and keep it clean. If the wound becomes seriously contaminated, visit your pediatrician or an emergency department, where they likely will flush it with water and start      antibiotics  such as penicillin or clindamycin.",

        "content": "By: Keri Wallace, MD, FAAP Hair loss (alopecia) may not be as common in kids as adults, but there are variety of a reasons it may happen. While it can be upsetting for both parents and children, the condition usually improves once the cause is identified and addressed.  What causes hair loss in kids?  There are different causes of hair loss in infants, children and teens. The most common reasons depend on the child's age. In most cases, hair that is lost grows back on its own. There are treatments available when the hair is not growing back.  Is it normal for newborn babies to lose a lot of hair? Hair loss is very common in    newborns  and young babies. Almost all babies will have some (possibly all) of their hair fall out during the first few months of life. This is normal and to be expected—the hair will grow back!  Some babies will lose more hair on the back of their heads than other parts of the scalp. Don't worry—this is not unusual, and the hair grows back normally over a few months. Common reasons for hair loss in older kids Hair loss in older children can have a variety of causes. Some of the more common reasons a a child or teen may lose hair include: \t \t  Image: Traction alopecia\t Hair that is styled tightly  (like in tight braids or frequent tight ponytails or buns) can cause hair loss, especially along the edges of the scalp at the front, sides and back. This condition is called    traction alopecia .  It can get better by changing to looser hair styles. Avoiding caps and other things that constantly rub on the scalp can also help the hair grow back.\t Stress.  Physical stress (like high fever, hospitalization or surgery) or emotional stress (like a death in the family, a new school or a new home) may cause more hair to fall out than normal. This type of hair loss, called    telogen effluvium , can happen over a few weeks or months. The condition makes the hair seem thinner than it was before, but doesn't cause bald patches or complete loss of hair. Telogen effluvium hair loss gradually gets better on its own.\t \t  Image: Trichotillomania\t A child’s habit of twisting or pulling their hair , which is called     trichotillomania . Many children who develop this behavior often don't even realize they are doing it. Trichotillomania can cause the hair to break and fall out, leading to patches on the scalp with less hair than normal and broken off stubble hairs. Very young children tend to outgrow this habit. Older children and teens may benefit from    counseling  and mental health care to break the habit.\t  \t A fungal infection  can sometimes cause hair loss. \" Ringworm \" is a fairly common fungus infection of the skin or the hair. The medical terms for these infections are    tinea corporis  and    tinea capitis . When this infection is on the scalp, the hairs break and fall out and the skin can look irritated and flaky. Treatment with an anti-fungus medicine given by mouth is necessary to clear this infection from the scalp.\t     \t Images: tine a infection When bald spots are a sign of alopecia areata\t Alopecia areata  is an autoimmune disease that can affect people of any age, including children. It happens when the immune system, which is supposed to protect us and fight germs, instead attacks the hair follicles and causes hair to fall out.  What does alopecia areata look like? Alopecia areata shows up as round or oval bald spots on the scalp with completely missing hair leaving smooth patches of skin. Most of the time, alopecia areata is limited to a few    patches , and the hair will regrow and fill in the patches. \t         \t Images: Alopecia areata Treatment for alopecia areata Treatments for alopecia areata can help when the hair doesn't regrow in a few months or a lot of the hair on the scalp is missing. The first step in treatment is with creams or ointments or lotions (such as steroid medicines) applied to the bald spots to decrease the immune system activity in those areas.  If the hair loss is widespread, it can be more difficult to treat. Luckily, new treatments are being studied all the time and some show good promise for more difficult alopecia areata.  When to see your pediatrician  Most newborns and very young infants will lose hair after birth, so there's usually no need to see a doctor beyond    regular checkups  for this. However, discuss any ongoing hair loss that's affecting your child or teen with your pediatrician.  The doctor will look at your child's scalp and do a physical exam to help determine the cause of the hair loss. Sometimes bloodwork may be ordered and sent to a lab. For some children, a referral to a    pediatric dermatologist  may be needed.

        "content": "​​​Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is disease that causes small blood vessels to become swollen and irritated—a condition called  vasculitis .  It is most common in children between the ages of 3 and 15 years old and is rarely seen in adults. HSP is not contagious and tends to affect boys more than girls. Cause The actual cause of HSP is not known. About half the time, however, children who get HSP have a cold or respiratory infection such as  strep throat  beforehand. HSP has also been linked to bug bites, cold weather, and some vaccinations. Signs & Symptoms Usually, the first sign of HSP is a rash called  palpable purpura  that appears as dark reddish splotches on the feet, legs, and buttocks. A child with HSP may also have joint pain, abdominal pain, and/or kidney problems. Rash Nearly every child diagnosed with HSP has a painless rash. The rash usually starts as raised wheals, reddish blotches, and little red dots ( petechiae ) around the feet and ankles. The rash may also be on the legs and buttocks. In smaller children—especially those who do not yet walk—the rash is often seen on the arms, trunk, and face. The rash usually takes about 10 days to fade. Joint Pain The majority of children with HSP experience joint pains. Children typically only have a few affected joints—hips, knees, and ankles. While the joints may swell for 1-3 days, there is no permanent damage. Abdominal Pain About 50% of children with HSP will have  abdominal pain . Abdominal problems may be fairly mild (e.g., nausea, vomiting, and mild pain). In rare occasions, abdominal problems are much more serious and involve gastrointestinal bleeding or intussusception. Intussusception is when the intestine folds in on itself and may become blocked. Abdominal pain tends to come on about a week after the rash first develops.  Kidney Problems About 25% to 50% of children with HSP will have kidney problems. Usually, kidney problems due to HSP begin within days to 6 weeks after the rash first appears. The most common kidney problem seen is  blood in the urine . Blood is the urine is not usually visible to the naked eye. About 10% of the time, the urine becomes red or brown from blood. Up to 50% of patients also lose protein in the urine, and about 20% of the time protein lost is excessive.  Excessive loss of protein in urine requires the help of a  pediatric nephrologist . Losing a lot of protein means a child is at risk for more serious problems—kidney damage and high blood pressure. Sometimes a pediatric nephrologist will perform a kidney biopsy to look at how severely a HSP affects a child's kidneys. Diagnosing HSP The diagnosis of HSP is almost always based on symptoms. Your pediatrician may do blood and urine tests to help rule out other conditions and to check kidney function. There is not a specific blood test to diagnose HSP. An abdominal ultrasound may be done in patients with severe abdominal pain. In patients who have partial or unusual symptoms, a biopsy of the skin or the kidney may help make the diagnosis. Treatment HSP is a mild illness, so it is usually treated with rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain medicines such as  acetaminophen  (Tylenol). In severe cases, a child may need to be hospitalized. Once the symptoms of HSP disappear, children should have their urine checked for blood and protein for at least 6 months after they are first diagnosed—even if their urine was normal at first. This is to make sure that the disease did not damage a child's kidneys and that they are working properly. Sometimes, HSP in the kidneys persists or comes later and may need additional treatment. Outlook Most of the time, HSP improves and goes away completely within a month. Sometimes HSP relapses; this is more common when a child's kidneys are involved. If HSP does come back, it is usually less severe than the first time. The long-term prognosis of HSP largely depends on whether the kidneys have been involved and, if so, how severe the involvement is.

        "content": "​​Hives, also known as urticaria, are pink or red bumps in the skin. They are sometimes described as welts. Hives usually appear out of the blue without warning. Each hive tends to flatten out over a few hours, but new bumps can continue to appear for several days or longer.​ ​​What do hives look like?\t  They can be small and round red bumps or larger swellings of all different shapes. Sometimes they are even ring or donut-shaped or shaped like a target. The rings may have normal skin in the middle, or look purplish or br​uise-like. Sometimes this purple patch will last longer than the hive itself. ​Hives are usually itchy. Hives can appear anywhere on the body.  It is common for young children with hives to also get swelling of the hands and feet. This can be uncomfortable, and can cause the child to be fussy and unhappy.​\t   Clockwise from top left: hives (urticaria) on ​trunk, leg, arms and feet.​ Who gets hives?  Children and adults of any age can get hives. Hives are very common. 15-20% of people will get hives at some time in their lives. What causes hives? Hives are a reaction to lots of different triggers. Minor infections from viruses are a common cause of hives in young children. Often the child seems well and has no or very few other sick symptoms before the hives begin. Other things that can cause hives include: foods, medicines, additives to foods and vitamins such as color dyes, other kinds of minor infections such as dental infections, and in some cases even exercise, stress, sunlight, ice or other cold things touching the skin, or very rarely other underlying illnesses. In up to a third of cases, however, a specific cause for hives cannot be found.     How long do hives last?  In most children, outbreaks of hives will end within 2 weeks. Occasionally the hives can keep coming for weeks to months. How are hives diagnosed? Hives are usually easily recognized when seen by a healthcare provider. In most cases, there are no good tests to figure out why ​a child has hives. If outbreaks of hives are lasting for many weeks, further testing may be recommended depending on if the child has any other symptoms.  Treatment for Hives If there is a known trigger for the hives, it should be avoided. As mentioned above, most cases of hives in children don't have a clear trigger that you can avoid.  Antihistamines are the main treatment for hives. Your healthcare provider may recommend over-the-counter cetirizine, loratadine or fexofenadine during the daytime because they do not cause sleepiness. Over-the-counter diphenhydramine may be recommended at night. These medications work best when taken on a regular schedule each day to keep the hives from coming back.  Your doctor may prescribe other treatments for hives that don't respond to antihistamines.  When should I be worried about hives?  Let a doctor know right away and go to the nearest emergency room if your child has swelling or tingling of the mouth, tongue or throat, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, and/or vomiting with the hives. These symptoms need emergency care. More information\t HealthyChildren.org: Skin Conditions\t HealthyChildren.org: Allergies & Asthma​​​ *Images provided by Sheilagh Maguiness, MD, FAAD, FAAP     ​",

        "content": "By: Sarah Stein, MD, FAAD, FAAP & Sheilagh Maguiness, MD, FAAD, FAAP Children with  eczema  (atopic dermatitis) tend to get patches of dry, itchy skin. The itch can make it hard for them to to sleep. Plus, scratching can cause the rashes to get infected. While there is no known cure for eczema, it can be treated so your child feels better. There are also ways to help your child avoid eczema flare-ups. Eczema treatments usually target four common problems: dryness, itching, irritated skin (inflammation) and infection.\t   Dryness: repairing the skin barrier For children with eczema, the skin barrier isn't holding in water well. As a result, the skin becomes    dry  and cracked, and is more likely to get infected. Dry skin is also very itchy. Gentle skin care daily is important to improve the skin barrier. As part of this: Give your child a bath (or shower)  every day or every other day for 5-10 minutes in lukewarm water. No soap is needed, but a gentle non-soap cleanser can be used on the sweaty areas (armpits, neck, groin) and on the hands and feet. Use only fragrance-free, hypoallergenic cleansers. Avoid scrubbing your child's skin with anything rough. Don't use bubble bath in the bath water. Pat your child's skin dry  after the bath or shower. If your doctor has prescribed any topical medicines, apply these to the areas of rash (BEFORE applying any moisturizers). Apply a moisturizer to the whole body immediately after bathing  (while the skin is still damp) everyday. This helps \"lock in\" the moisture of the water. The creamier the moisturizer, the better it will work. Ointments such as petroleum jelly or fragrance-free moisturizing CREAMS are good choices (lotions are thinner and less effective). Most importantly, find a moisturizer that your child likes to use. Moisturizers should be applied once or twice every day, even when the rash is gone. Dress your child in soft fabrics like 100% cotton.  Use mild, fragrance-free laundry detergents. Don't use fabric softeners or fabric sheets in the dryer. Minimize your child's exposure to things that are known to commonly be irritating to sensitive skin. This includes fragrance in products and in the air, for example, as well as smoke, dust, wool, and animal dander. Reducing the itch of eczema\t Gentle skincare as described above is the first step in making the skin feel less itchy. Other ways to help reduce the itch of eczema: Prevent scratching.  Try to stop your child from scratching as much as possible since scratching can make the skin feel even more itchy. Scratching can also lead to open sores which can lead to skin infections. Keep your child's nails cut short. Wearing cotton gloves at night can also help. Wet wrap treatments.  Apply wet wraps AFTER bathing and applying topical medicines and moisturizers. Here's how: Apply prescribed medicine to areas of rash and apply moisturizer to surrounding skin. Soak a pair of pajamas or onesies in warm water. Wring out the pajamas until they are damp and not dripping. Put the damp pajamas on your child, with dry pajamas on top. Make sure the room is warm or provide a warm blanket, so your child doesn't feel cold. Keep the wet wraps on for at least a half an hour, or leave them on overnight. After removing the wet wraps, reapply moisturizer. Antihistamine medicines  like    diphenhydramine  and hydroxyzine may help your child feel drowsy so they fall asleep more easily instead of scratching their skin. Antihistamines do not usually take away the itch, though. Always follow directions about your child's age and weight and talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions. Healing irritated skin & rashes Topical steroid medicines  (\"steroids\" or \"cortisones\") are applied to the skin to heal irritated eczema rashes (inflammation). These prescription medications are usually used twice a day when the rash is flaring. Topical steroids come in different strengths and forms (such as lotions, ointments, creams, gels, and oils). Your doctor will help you find the right combination for your child's skin. When used correctly, topical steroids are very safe and effective. Non-steroid eczema medicines  (tacrolimus ointment, pimecrolimus cream, crisaborole ointment) also help heal irritated eczema rashes using different active ingredients than steroids. They can be helpful on mild eczema and on delicate areas of skin, like the eyelids, armpits and groin. Managing & preventing skin infections Bacteria and viruses can make eczema rashes worse, and it's important to watch for signs of infection. Look for    oozing, crusting, pus bumps, blisters or a worsening rash  that is not getting better with your usual treatments. Be sure to talk to your doctor if you think your child's skin is infected. Infections may require antibiotic or antiviral medicines.\t   Diluted bleach baths for eczema\t Soaking in a tub with a small amount of bleach added to the water 2-3 times per week can help prevent skin infections. Bleach baths, which are similar to swimming in a chlorinated pool, are easy to do at home: \t Add 1/2 cup of plain household bleach (sodium hypochlorite) OR 1/3 cup of concentrated household bleach to a full tub of lukewarm bathwater and stir the water to dilute the bleach. Make sure you use PLAIN bleach; splash-free or scented bleach products are not effective and could lead to more irritation. If using an infant tub, use 2 tablespoons of bleach to a full tub of water. Have your child soak in the bath for 10-15 minutes. Try to soak the entire body. Since the bath is like a swimming pool, it is safe to get your child's face and scalp wet as well. For babies and young children, use    touch supervision  to avoid drowning as you would during regular bath time. Rinse the dilute bleach water off at the end of the bath. Then, after pat-drying the skin, apply eczema medicine to areas of rash and a moisturizer all over.   New treatments for eczema\t Biologic therapies (\"biologics\")  are medicines that target the part of the immune system that is causing the irritated skin rash. Dupilumab is the first biologic therapy approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of eczema in children ages 6 and up. This medication can be very helpful for moderate to severe eczema that is not well controlled with topical medicines and gentle skin care.    Talk to your doctor  to learn more about this treatment option. When can I stop treatment for an eczema rash? Once your child's skin is no longer itchy and the areas of rash are smooth and soft, you can start to use the medicines less often. It is common for the skin to be discolored after the rash flare heals, but the color will naturally normalize over time. However, since eczema is an ongoing skin problem, it is important to continue your routine of gentle skin care and use of moisturizers every day to minimize future flares and infections. How can I prevent future eczema flares? Gentle daily skin care,  as described above, is one of the most important things you can do to prevent future eczema flares. Talk with your doctor about a daily routine that is best for your child. Avoiding triggers  is also important to prevent future flares of eczema. Eczema triggers are different for different children. Some parents and physicians may consider allergy testing to further identify triggers that can be avoided. Some    triggers  include:\t Dust mites Fragrances (including perfumes, colognes, air fresheners, candles, incense) Heat and    sweat Hormones\t Insect bites and stings\t Pet  dander\t Pollen Tobacco  smoke Wool and synthetic fabrics\t In rare cases, certain foods can flare an eczema rash. If you think this might be the case,    talk to your doctor before trying any restrictive dietary changes . Remember  Keep in mind that your child's eczema may still flare despite your best efforts. Eczema is an ongoing skin problem that requires patience and consistent skin care.

        "content": "Roseola, also called exanthem subitum and sixth disease, is a common, contagious viral infection caused by the human herpesvirus (HHV) 6. This strain of the herpes virus is different than the one that causes cold sores or genital herpes infections. \t Roseola occurs most often in children aged 6 to 24 months. Youngsters typically have a high fever (greater than 103°F or 39.5°C) for 3 to 7 days. After the fever disappears, a rash will develop on the torso and spread to the arms, legs, back, and face. This rash usually only lasts for hours, but in some cases persists for several days. Some children have seizures associated with the high fever, but more often the fever is accompanied by a decrease in appetite, a mild cough, and a runny nose. This pattern of a high fever followed by a rash will help your pediatrician make the diagnosis of this infection. However, HHV-6 can also cause fever without rash or rash without fever. \t Human herpes virus 6 is spread from person to person via secretions from the respiratory tract. You can reduce the chances of your child becoming infected by making sure that he washes his hands thoroughly and frequently. There is no specific treatment for roseola, and it usually goes away without causing any complications. If your child’s fever makes him uncomfortable, ask your pediatrician about lowering his temperature with acetaminophen. \t Similar symptoms are associated with another herpesvirus infection caused by HHV-7. Many children infected with HHV-7 have only a mild illness. Human herpes virus 7 may be responsible for second or recurrent cases of roseola that were originally caused by HHV-6. Like all of the viruses in the herpes family, these viruses will stay within the body for life. If a person’s immune system becomes weakened by disease or medicines, the virus can reappear to cause fever and infection in the lungs or brain.",

        "content": "By: Ingrid Polcari, MD, FAAP & Matthew Mahoney, DO Impetigo  is a common skin infection caused by bacteria. It is most often seen in children between 2 and 5 years old, but anyone can get it. What causes impetigo? Impetigo starts when there is a break in the skin. This can be from an insect bite, cut, or skin damage from another condition like    eczema . The break in the skin acts like an open door, allowing bacteria to move in and cause an infection.  The most common bacteria that causes impetigo is a type of \"staph\" bacteria called  Staphylococcus aureus .  Is impetigo contagious? Impetigo is highly contagious. This means it is particularly good at spreading from person to person. There are more cases seen during warm weather, when cuts and scrapes from outdoor play are more likely.  What are the signs and symptoms of impetigo? Impetigo can be mostly crusty or have blisters: \t Crusted impetigo:  This is the most common type of impetigo and starts as tiny blisters (small bubbles filled with fluid) that burst and leave red oozing patches that dry into yellow or honey-colored crusts and scabs. \t Bullous impetigo:  The word \"bullous\" refers to the large blisters that form. It usually starts with large bubbles filled with clear fluid that may burst open, leaving moist red sores and then dry crusts. \t   What parts of the body can be affected by impetigo? Impetigo can develop anywhere on the body. It is especially common on the face, including around the nose, mouth and ears. It is also frequently seen on the arms and legs. Less commonly, impetigo can develop in the    diaper  area. How is impetigo diagnosed?  Most of the time, your child's doctor can diagnose impetigo just by looking at the rash. In some cases, a sample may be collected from the rash and sent to the lab to see if bacteria can be grown. This can help confirm the diagnosis but is not always necessary.  How is impetigo treated?\t \t  Impetigo needs to be treated with antibiotics. There are two forms of antibiotics that help: topical (put on top of the affected skin) and oral (taken by mouth). Topical antibiotics are used for less severe cases or if there is only a small area of skin affected, while oral antibiotics are used for cases where a large area is affected. Once an antibiotic is started, healing should start within a few days. It's important to complete the full course of antibiotics, even if the infection looks like it is improving before the end.  While the infected area is healing, it should be cleaned with soap and water every day to gently remove the yellow crusts and scabs. The open sores should be covered loosely with a bandage to prevent spreading the infection to other people.    How to avoid spreading impetigo\t   Since impetigo is very contagious, your child should avoid close contact with other children until the rash is clear or improving after two days of antibiotics. If you come in contact with the rash, be sure to wash your hands and the exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water. Also, keep your child's washcloths and towels separate from those of other family members.  How can you prevent impetigo infection?  Since the bacteria that causes impetigo enters through breaks in the skin, the best way to avoid this infection is to prevent breaks in the skin.  If a break in the skin does develop, cleanse it with soap and water and apply an antibiotic cream or ointment until it heals. Encourage your child not to pick at sores or scabs to avoid letting in the bacteria. Be careful not to use washcloths or towels that have been used by someone else who has an active skin infection.

        "content": "By: Deepti Gupta, MD, FAAD, FAAP & Matthew Mahoney, DO Molluscum contagiosum, or molluscum for short, is a common skin infection in children. It is caused by a poxvirus, called molluscum virus. The infection leads to harmless small, skin-colored bumps in the skin's top layers. Most often, molluscum eventually clears up on its own without medical treatment. How do you get molluscum?  The virus that causes molluscum is spread mostly by skin-to-skin contact. However, the virus can also spread on things like towels, bedding or shared athletic equipment. The bumps seen with molluscum usually appear two to six weeks after the skin has been exposed to the virus.  What are the signs & symptoms of molluscum? \t Molluscum causes small, round (usually less than ¼ inch) raised bumps (also called papules) on the skin. They are usually skin-colored or pinkish with a shiny surface. They often have a small indent or dot near the center of the bump. Molluscum bumps are found most often on the body, arms and legs, but may show up anywhere including the face and groin. They often cluster in areas where the skin touches, like the armpits, elbow fold and behind the knees. The bumps can be itchy, but aren't usually painful. When the molluscum bumps go away they can sometimes leave behind small \"pock marks\" or pinpoint pits. How do we treat molluscum? Most children with molluscum do not need treatment. Without treatment, the bumps will usually disappear within 6 months to 2 years on their own.\t There are treatment options if the molluscum bumps are bothersome in how they look or feel, or when there is concern about their spread to others.  Some treatment options for molluscum include freezing the bumps (called cryotherapy), scraping off the bumps (called curettage), or using chemicals to make the body fight them faster (called  cantharidin  solution or berdazimer gel). Other products can be used on the skin to irritate the molluscum bumps to get the body's immune system to recognize them, but these have mixed results.  Some of these methods can be painful and in rare cases, can lead to scarring or changes in the skin color after the molluscum bumps have healed. What if the molluscum bumps hurt? Sometimes, molluscum bumps can become enlarged, red and sore before they start to go away. If that happens, warm compresses can help. To make a warm compress, you can soak a clean washcloth under warm running water. Squeeze out excess water and place it on the painful bumps for 10 minutes. If there is a spreading red patch around a bump, contact your child's doctor. How do you prevent molluscum? As with most types of infection,  washing hands  often is most important. It also helps to avoid sharing towels, clothing and personal items. Individuals affected by molluscum should cover the bumps that aren't under clothing and that might easily come in contact with others.  Remember Molluscum infection is common and can be a bother, but the bumps aren't dangerous and gradually clear on their own. Your child's doctor can provide more guidance and advice if the bumps are causing you or your child concern.

        "content": "Fortunately, the most common type of worm infesting children, the pinworm, is essentially harmless. The pinworm is unpleasant to look at and may cause itching and, in girls, vaginal discharge, but it is not responsible for more serious health concerns. Pinworms cause more social concern than medical problems. \t Pinworms are spread easily from one child to another by the transfer of eggs. Often an infected child scratches himself, picking up an egg, and then transfers it to the sandbox or a toilet seat where another child unknowingly picks up the egg and later transfers it to his mouth. The eggs are swallowed, later hatch, and the pinworm makes its way to the anus to again deposit its eggs. Pinworms usually present with itching around your child’s behind at night. Girls may also have vaginal itching. If you take a look at the skin around the anus you may see the adult worms which are whitish gray and threadlike, measuring about 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch (0.63–1.27 cm) long. Your pediatrician might collect some of the worms and eggs by applying the sticky side of a strip of clear cellophane tape to the skin around the anus. The tape can be examined under a microscope to confirm the presence of the parasite. \t Treatment \t Pinworms can be treated easily with an oral prescription drug, taken in a single dose and then repeated in one to two weeks. This medication causes the mature pinworms to be expelled through bowel movements. Some pediatricians may advise treating the other family members, as well, since one of them may be a carrier without having any symptoms. This medication is not recommended for use in children under two years of age. Also, when the infection is resolved, the child’s underclothes, bedclothes, and sheets should be washed carefully to reduce the risk of reinfection. \t Prevention \t It is very difficult to prevent pinworms, but here are some hints that might be helpful. \t Encourage your child to wash her hands after using the bathroom. \t Encourage her sitter or child care provider to wash the toys frequently, particularly if pinworms have been detected in one or more of the children. \t Encourage your child to wash her hands after playing with a house cat or dog, since these pets can carry the eggs in their fur.",

        "content": "The inflammatory skin disorder pityriasis rosea peaks in incidence during adolescence and young adulthood. It typically begins as a large (three-quarters of an inch to two inches in diameter) pink rash on the chest or back. This is called a “herald patch,” because it is indeed a harbinger of what is to follow. \t Within one to two weeks, the youngster breaks out in dozens, if not hundreds, of smaller faint-pink rashes. The trunk, arms, legs and neck may be affected, but rarely the face. Parents often confuse pityriasis rosea with ringworm, a fungal infection. Pityriasis rosea’s cause isn’t known, but it is not a fungal infection and therefore isn’t helped by antifungal medications. One way to recognize the disorder is to examine the chest or back for the distinctive Christmas-tree-shaped pattern of its flat, oval-shaped lesions. \t Pityriasis rosea presents differently in African Americans, who tend to develop raised patches on their face and extremities more so than on their torsos. The color usually differs, too: light-brown instead of pink, and with a coarse, granular center. \t Symptoms That Suggest Pityriasis Rosea May Include: \t Large pink patch, typically on the torso, followed by: \t Multiple smaller rashes \t Mild fatigue \t Mild itching \t How Pityriasis Rosea Is Diagnosed \t Physical examination and thorough medical history, plus KOH prep, in which a tiny sample of tissue from one of the spots is scraped off and examined under a microscope to rule out fungal infection. \t How Pityriasis Rosea Is Treated \t Pityriasis rosea is not contagious and does not pose any danger, usually running its course within three to nine weeks. Expect new spots to erupt during that time. Until the rashes fade and disappear—leaving no scars, happily—your pediatrician will focus on controlling symptoms. For example, lotions or antihistamines may be prescribed to relieve the itching. Exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light treatments are sometimes recommended to hasten resolution of the rashes. \t Helping Teenagers Help Themselves \t Youngsters with symptomatic pityriasis rosea may wish to avoid strenuous physical activity, which can exacerbate existing rashes. Bathing in lukewarm water, not hot water, is also recommended.",

        "content": "Skin reactions to poison ivy or poison oak are very uncomfortable, itchy, and unsightly. They can make a child miserable. \t About half of the children who come in contact with either poison ivy or poison oak have an allergic reaction. Typically, the skin becomes reddened, swollen, and blistered, with the rash shaped like streaks or in patches. The children experience severe itching and burning sensations. The rash usually appears one to four days after your child is exposed. Then blisters form and soon rupture, fluid oozes out of them, and they eventually become crusty. \t As with all allergies, preventing exposure to the offending agent is most important. Particularly if your child spends time in forests and fields, make sure she knows what the poison ivy and poison oak plants look like. Poison ivy is a red-stemmed, three-leafed plant whose shiny green leaves turn bright red in the fall. Poison oak has green shiny leaves that also grow three to a stem. You might teach your child the poem: \"Leaves of three, let them be.\" Particularly when you have younger children, inspect the parks they play in for any poison ivy or oak, and have the plants removed. \t The skin reactions to poison ivy and poison oak are not contagious and cannot be transmitted from one child to another. But if your youngster comes in contact with the plants themselves, she should wash immediately with soap and water to remove as much of the sap or oil as possible. This will keep its absorption—and the ensuing inflammation—to a minimum. Pets playing in yards with poison ivy and poison oak can be a source of exposure to family members. \t The rash will heal within about two weeks, although your doctor may suggest some treatment to relieve the symptoms. For instance, to ease both the itching and oozing, have your child soak the affected area in cool water for a few minutes, or rub it gently for ten to twenty minutes, several times a day, with an ice cube; then let the skin air-dry. A hydrocortisone cream might also be helpful. To discourage scratching and further damage to the skin, keep your child's fingernails trimmed. If your youngster cannot sleep at night because of the itching, you may give her an antihistamine. While mild cases can be treated at home, consult a doctor if your child is especially uncomfortable, if the rash is severe, if it has erupted on your child's face or groin, or if it shows signs of infection (fever, redness, and swelling beyond the poison ivy or oak lesions).",

        "content": "Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac commonly cause skin rashes in children during the spring, summer, and fall seasons. An allergic reaction to the oil in these plants produces the rash. The rash occurs from several hours to three days after contact with the plant and begins in the form of blisters, accompanied by severe itching. \t Contrary to popular belief, it is not the fluid in the blisters that causes the rash to spread. This spreading occurs when small amounts of oil remain under the child’s fingernails, on her clothing, or on a pet’s hair that then comes in contact with other parts of her body. The rash will not be spread to another person unless the oil that remains also comes in contact with that person’s skin. \t Poison ivy grows as a three- leafed green weed with a red stem at the center. It grows in vinelike form in all parts of the country except the Southwest. Poison sumac is a shrub, not a vine, and has seven to thirteen leaves arranged in pairs along a central stem. Not nearly as abundant as poison ivy, it grows primarily in the swampy areas of the Mississippi River region. Poison oak grows as a shrub, and it is seen primarily on the West Coast. All three plants produce similar skin reactions. These skin reactions are forms of contact dermatitis. \t Treatment \t Treating reactions to poison ivy—the most frequent of these forms of contact dermatitis—is a straightforward matter. \t Prevention is the best approach. Know what the plant looks like and teach your children to avoid it. \t If there is contact, wash all clothes and shoes in soap and water. Also, wash the area of the skin that was exposed with soap and water for at least ten minutes after the plant or the oil has been touched. \t If the eruption is mild, apply calamine lotion three or four times a day to cut down on the itching. Avoid those preparations containing anesthetics or antihistamines, as often they can cause allergic eruptions themselves. \t Apply topical 1 percent hydrocortisone cream to decrease the inflammation. \t If the rash is severe, on the face, or on extensive parts of the body, the pediatrician may need to place your child on oral steroids. These will need to be given for about six to ten days, often with the dose tapering in a specific schedule determined by your pediatrician. This treatment should be reserved for the most severe cases. \t Call the pediatrician if you notice any of the following: \t Severe eruption not responsive to the previously described home methods \t Any evidence of infection, such as blisters, redness, or oozing \t Any new eruption or rash \t Severe poison ivy on the face \t Fever",

        "content": "By: Sarah Stein, MD, FAAP & Andie Kwon, MD Psoriasis is a skin condition that affects both children and adults. The rash from psoriasis can appear anywhere on the body, including the nails. Here are some common questions parents may have about psoriasis. What does a psoriasis rash look like? In light-skinned children, the spots of rash look pink-red, while in children with darker skin tones the rash is more purple or brown. In most cases, there are thick white flakes on the surface of the spots. A rash from psoriasis can appear in different patterns  (see \"Types of psoriasis rash,\" below.) What causes psoriasis? Psoriasis can come on suddenly and for no particular reason. Children with psoriasis sometimes have family members who also have psoriasis. In some children, psoriasis may appear after an illness, especially after a case of strep throat. Psoriasis is NOT contagious and can't spread from person to person.  What are the signs and symptoms of psoriasis?  The first sign of psoriasis is the rash. The rash of psoriasis can appear anywhere on the skin. Examples include the scalp, behind the ears, the groin, the palms of the hand and soles of the feet. Fingernails and toenails can also be affected. In some people, only a few areas of the body may be affected. In others, the whole body can be covered with patches of psoriasis. The rash may be itchy for some kids. The rash of psoriasis can be very bothersome and frustrating. It can affect a child's or teen's mood, making them sad or depressed or angry. How is psoriasis different than eczema?  Psoriasis and eczema are both chronic conditions that can cause dry, itchy, inflamed skin. While the rashes may seem similar, there are differences in how they look, where they develop and intensity of the itch. Types of psoriasis rash There are different patterns of the psoriasis rash. These include plaque psoriasis, inverse psoriasis, guttate psoriasis and nail psoriasis: \t Plaque psoriasis  is the most common type of psoriasis. There are thick or thin reddish or purplish patches with stuck-on white flakes. These patches are most common on the elbows and knees and sometimes the scalp, but can be anywhere on the body.\t \t \t   Inverse psoriasis  is when the rash patches are in the skin folds, such as the armpits and groin. Because these areas of the body are usually moist and sweaty, the surface flakes are often missing.\t \t  Guttate psoriasis  looks like small, raindrop-shaped spots with a little bit of white flaking on top. This pattern of psoriasis is sometimes seen after strep throat or other minor infections.\t \t \t Nail psoriasis  affects the fingernails and toenails causing the nails to have small pits or grooves or to lift up at the edge or to become yellow brown in color. \t \t \t \t  How is psoriasis treated? There is no cure for psoriasis. However, there are very effective treatments to keep the rash as clear as possible.  Medications\t Topical medications  are products that you can put on \"top\" of your skin, like creams or ointments or solutions or shampoos. Depending on where the rash is, there are many kinds of topical medicines that your child's doctor can prescribe to help the psoriasis rash. If topical medications are not helpful enough or too difficult to use, there are also    oral medications  (taken by mouth) or  injections  (shots). The oral medications and shots are called \"systemic\" medications because they work from the inside and treat the whole system at once. If using the pills or shots, there are often blood tests the doctor will need to check so that your child can safely take these medicines. Phototherapy Another type of treatment that may be recommended is called    phototherapy . Phototherapy uses limited types of ultraviolet light rays on the skin to clear the rash. This light comes out of specialized machines in the doctor's office and requires visits to the office 2-3 times every week for several months. Dermatologists and other specialists are important members of the team helping to treat psoriasis. It is important for children and teens to know that psoriasis is very treatable so that they will not feel unhappy or anxious. Is psoriasis related to other medical conditions? Sometimes people with psoriasis can be more at risk of having other medical conditions.   Arthritis  This is irritation in the joints that can cause the joints to be swollen, stiff, red and painful. There are many types of arthritis, but psoriasis is a condition that can cause a form of arthritis as well as the skin rash. The joint pain is usually worst in the morning and gets better after moving the joints around. Some children with psoriasis may develop psoriatic arthritis.   Hyperlipidemia & diabetes   Hyperlipidemia  is when there are high levels of fat in the blood. Diabetes is when there are high levels of sugar in the blood. Children with psoriasis seem to have a higher chance of developing these problems as they grow up.   Inflammatory bowel disease  This is a condition that affects the intestines, causing pains in the belly and diarrhea. Some children with psoriasis may develop inflammatory bowel disease. It's important for your child to see their pediatrician regularly to monitor their overall health. If your child has psoriasis and you notice they complain of joint pain or belly pain a lot, it is important to discuss these concerns with your child's doctor. When to contact your pediatrician Please see your child's doctor if you have any questions or concerns about your child's skin. If your pediatrician diagnoses psoriasis, your child may be referred to a skin doctor ( dermatologist ).

        "content": "If your child has a scaly round patch on the side of his scalp or elsewhere on his skin, and he seems to be losing hair in the same area of the scalp, the problem may be a contagious infection known as ringworm or tinea. \t This disorder is caused not by worms but by a fungus. It’s called ringworm because the infections tend to form round or oval spots that, as they grow, become smooth in the center but keep an active red scaly border. \t Scalp ringworm often is spread from person to person, sometimes when sharing infected hats, combs, brushes, and barrettes. If ringworm appears elsewhere on your child’s body, he may have the type spread by infected dogs or cats. \t The first signs of infection on the body are red, scaly patches. They may not look like rings until they’ve grown to half an inch in diameter, and they generally stop growing at about 1 inch. Your child may have just one patch or several. These lesions may be mildly itchy and uncomfortable. \t Scalp ringworm starts the same way the body variety does, but as the rings grow, your child may lose some hair in the infected area. Certain types of scalp ringworm produce less obvious rings and are easily confused with dandruff or cradle cap. Cradle cap, however, occurs only during infancy. If your child’s scalp is continually scaly and he’s over a year old, you should suspect ringworm and notify your pediatrician. \t Treatment \t A single ringworm patch on the body can be treated with an over-the-counter cream recommended by your pediatrician. The most frequently used ones are tolnaftate, miconazole, and clotrimazole. A small amount is applied two or three times a day for at least a week, during which time some clearing should begin. If there are any patches on the scalp or more than one on the body, or if the rash is getting worse while being treated, check with your pediatrician again. She will prescribe a stronger medication and, in the case of scalp ringworm, will use an oral antifungal preparation. Your child will have to take medicine for several weeks to clear the infection. \t You also may need to wash your child’s scalp with a special shampoo when he has scalp ringworm. If there’s any possibility that others in the family have caught the infection, they also should use this shampoo and be examined for possible signs of infection. Do not allow your child to share combs, brushes, hair clips, barrettes, or hats. \t Prevention \t You can help prevent ringworm by identifying and treating any pets with the problem. Look for scaling, itchy, hairless areas on your dogs and cats, and have them treated right away. Any family members, playmates, or schoolmates who show symptoms also should be treated.",

        "content": "Your ten-month-old doesn’t look or act very ill, but she suddenly develops a fever between 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius) and 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40.5 degrees Celsius). The fever lasts for three to seven days, during which time your child may have less appetite, mild diarrhea, a slight cough, and a runny nose, and seems mildly irritable and a little sleepier than usual. Her upper eyelids may appear slightly swollen or droopy. Finally, after her temperature returns to normal, she gets a slightly raised, spotty pink rash on her trunk, which spreads only to her upper arms and neck and fades after just twenty-four hours. What’s the diagnosis? Most likely it’s a disease called roseola— a contagious viral illness that’s most common in children under age two. Its incubation period is seven to fourteen days. The key to this diagnosis is that the rash appears after the fever is gone. We now know that a specific virus causes this condition. \t Treatment \t Whenever your infant or young child has a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius) or higher for twenty-four hours, call your pediatrician, even if there are no other symptoms. If the doctor suspects the fever is caused by roseola, he may suggest ways to control the temperature and advise you to call again if your child becomes worse or the fever lasts for more than three or four days. For a child who has other symptoms or appears more seriously ill, the doctor may order a blood count, urinalysis, or other tests. \t Since illnesses that cause fever can be contagious, it’s wise to keep your child away from other children, at least until you’ve conferred with your pediatrician. Once she is diagnosed as having roseola, don’t let her play with other children until her fever subsides. Once her fever is gone for twenty-four hours, even if the rash has appeared, your child can return to child care or preschool, and resume normal contact with other children. \t While your child has a fever, dress her in lightweight clothing. If she is very uncomfortable because of the fever, you can give her acetaminophen in the appropriate dose for her age and weight. Don’t worry if her appetite is decreased, and encourage her to drink extra fluids. \t Although this disease rarely is serious, be aware that early in the illness, when fever climbs very quickly, there’s a chance of convulsions. There may be a seizure regardless of how well you treat the fever, so it’s important to know how to manage convulsions even though they’re usually quite mild and occur only briefly, if at all, with roseola.",

        "content": "By: Sarah Asch, MS, MD, FAAP, FAAD \t Scabies  is an itchy rash caused by the human itch mite. Adults, children and babies can all get scabies. Many people believe scabies is about cleanliness, but that is not true. Scabies can affect anyone, and it does not mean that someone who gets it is \"dirty.\" It is easily passed between people living closely with other people. Let's discuss how scabies makes you itchy and how to get rid of scabies safely.  What causes scabies? The human itch mite is microscopic in size. It can burrow into the very top layer of the skin (not any deeper), where it can lay eggs and eat. The mites are so tiny, there is no way to see them by looking with your eyes before the scabies rash starts. After a few days or weeks, an itchy rash develops in reaction to the mites.  What does scabies look like in children?\t Scabies rash looks different at different ages. Babies and toddlers, very elderly people or people with weakened immune systems can have a rash all over the body. In older children and adults, the rash is mostly on the hands, feet, armpits, belly button and genitals. It can look like hives (welts), pimples (pus bumps), blisters (tiny areas of fluid filled skin) or crusty bumps. But some people do not react with rash at all. It is very common to have 1 or 2 people with a rash in the house, but everyone at home is exposed and needs to be treated.    How can my doctor tell if my child has scabies? Scabies is diagnosed by looking carefully at the skin. The pattern of the rash, along with the story of when it started and who else is itchy, is usually enough for diagnosis. Sometimes your doctor may perform a skin scraping to look for the mite or other clues under the microscope.  How to get rid of scabies To get rid of scabies, you have to treat the people and the environment you live in all at the same time. All the people who come into regular contact need to be treated. This means everyone who lives with you, and regular visitors such as babysitters and grandparents.  How you apply the treatment cream for scabies makes a big difference.\t Permethrin 5% cream is the most commonly used medicine to treat scabies in adults, children and infants. In babies and toddlers (under age 2), the cream is applied to the scalp, neck and over the whole body to the toes. In older children and adults, the cream is applied from the neck down to the toes. The cream needs to get into all the body folds (armpits, belly button, crack of the buttocks, around the scrotum and penis) and spaces between the fingers and toes. It does not need to be used on the face. Permethrin cream is left on the skin overnight for 8-14 hours before it is rinsed off the next day. The treatment needs to be repeated in one week to take care of any eggs that hatched after the first treatment.  There are other creams and oral medicines that are sometimes needed in specific situations. Not all medications can be used in very young infants and pregnant women. Your doctor will help prescribe the right scabies treatment for your family.  You said, treat the people AND the environment. What do we need to clean and how? The mite can live for short periods of time outside of the skin on cloth items. This can be clothes, stuffed animals, bed linens, towels, soft parts of strollers, car seats, furniture and highchairs to name a few places. To get rid of scabies from the home, wash clothing, bed linens and towels using hot water and dry using the hot cycle. Vacuum furniture, carpets, car seats and strollers. If you can't wash or vacuum an item due to size or because it will damage it, you can place it in a sealed bag for at least 72 hours (3 days). Where needed, items can be dry-cleaned.  Do I need to treat my pets or get an exterminator? No. Your pets do not get human scabies. You do not need a special exterminator, just careful cleaning of the bed linens, furniture and other items as listed above.  When can we all go back to daycare, school or work? The great news is that this won't keep you isolated for long. You can all return to normal activities the day after all family members have started treatment, which means the day after the first overnight application of the permethrin cream.  We did all the treatments, but we are still itchy! What's the problem? Sometimes after the scabies are gone, children and adults can be itchy for several weeks. There are other topical medications that can be helpful with this problem. It is called \"post-scabetic pruritus\", which means \"after scabies itch\". It can make parents nervous, but is very common especially if your child had a big rash due to scabies.  But how do I know if I have cleared the scabies? Scabies goes away very well when the treatments and cleaning steps are followed carefully. But, if you, your child or anyone in the house is still getting new bumps two weeks after the last treatment, that person needs to be checked again.  What is crusted scabies? Crusted scabies is when a person has a very large amount of scabies mites on their skin and they are present in large crusts. It is a very contagious version, because it has a lot of scabies mites to pass around. It can occur in people with weakened immune systems. It has a distinctive appearance and is quite rare in children.  6 things to remember about scabies Be checked for scabies if your child has a new itchy rash, especially if other family members start to itch too! Use the prescribed creams as explained above for all household contacts two times, one week apart. Treat everyone all at the same time. Right after the skin treatment, start cleaning the home and doing the laundry as explained above. You do not need an exterminator. You do not need to treat your pets. Scabies is common, and it does not have anything to do with being clean. It is just a little bump in the road of life! Any questions or concerns along the way, make sure to check with your doctor.

        "content": "When your child has a strep throat, there’s a chance that they’ll get a rash known as scarlet fever.  The symptoms of scarlet fever begin with a sore throat, a fever of 101 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit (38.2–40 degrees Celsius), and headache. This is followed within 24 hours by a red rash covering the trunk, arms and legs.  Scarlet fever rash The rash is slightly raised, which makes the skin feel like fine sandpaper. Your child’s face may turn red, too, with a pale area around their mouth. This redness will disappear in 3 to 5 days, leaving peeling skin in the areas where the rash was most intense (neck, underarms, groin, fingers and toes). They may also have a white coated, then reddened, tongue and mild abdominal pain. Treatment for scarlet fever Call your pediatrician whenever your child complains of a sore throat, especially if they also have a rash or fever. The doctor will examine them and swab his throat to check for strep bacteria. If strep throat is found, an antibiotic (usually penicillin or amoxicillin) will be given. If your child takes the antibiotic by mouth rather than an injection, it’s extremely important to complete the entire course; shorter treatment sometimes results in a return of the disease.  Most children with strep infections respond very quickly to antibiotics. The fever, sore throat, and headache usually are gone within 24 hours. The rash, however, will remain for about 3 to 5 days.  If your child’s condition does not seem to improve with treatment, notify your pediatrician. If other family members develop a fever or sore throat at this time—with or without a rash—they, too, should be examined and tested for strep throat.  Complications of scarlet fever in children If not treated, scarlet fever (like strep throat) can lead to ear and sinus infections, swollen neck glands and pus around the tonsils. The most serious complication of untreated strep throat is rheumatic fever, which results in joint pain and swelling and sometimes heart damage. Very rarely, the strep bacteria in the throat can lead to  glomerulonephritis , or inflammation of the kidneys, causing blood to appear in the urine and sometimes high blood pressure.

        "content": "No matter our age or skin tone, we all need to take steps to prevent    sunburn  when we're enjoying the outdoors. Children especially need to be protected from the sun's burning rays, since most sun damage occurs in childhood.  Like other burns, sunburn will leave the skin red, warm, and painful. In severe cases it may cause blistering,    fever , chills, headache and a general feeling of illness. Your child doesn't actually have to be burned, however, in order to be harmed by the sun. The effects of exposure build over the years, so that even moderate exposure during childhood can contribute to wrinkling, toughening, freckling and even skin cancer later life. Also, some medications can cause a skin reaction to sunlight, and some medical conditions may make people more sensitive to the sun. How to treat a sunburn The signs of sunburn usually appear 6 to 12 hours after exposure, with the greatest discomfort during the first 24 hours. If your child's burn is just red, warm, and painful, you can treat it yourself. Apply cool compresses to the burned areas or bathe the child in cool water. You also can give    acetaminophen  to help relieve the pain.    (Check the package for the correct dosage for their age and weight.) If the sunburn causes blisters, fever, chills, headache or a general feeling of illness, call your pediatrician. Severe sunburn must be treated like any other serious burn; if it's very extensive, hospitalization sometimes is required. In addition, the blisters can become infected, requiring treatment with    antibiotics .  Sometimes extensive or severe sunburn also can lead to dehydration and, in some cases, fainting ( heatstroke ). If your child has these symptoms, contact your pediatrician right away or take them to the nearest emergency facility. Sunburn prevention Many parents incorrectly assume that the sun is dangerous only when it's shining brightly. In fact, it's not the visible light rays but rather the invisible ultraviolet rays that are harmful. Your child actually may be exposed to more ultraviolet rays on foggy or hazy days because they'll feel cooler and therefore stay outside longer. Exposure is also greater at higher altitudes. Even a big hat or an umbrella is not absolute protection because ultraviolet rays reflect off sand, water, snow and many other surfaces.\t   Try to keep your child out of the sun when the peak ultraviolet rays occur (between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.). In addition, follow these guidelines to protect your child's skin in the sun: Always use a sunscreen to block the damaging ultraviolet rays. Choose a sunscreen made for children with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher.    (Check the label.)\t   Apply the protection half an hour before going out. Keep in mind that no sunscreens are truly waterproof; so, they need to be reapplied every 1 -and-a-half to 2 hours, particularly if your child spends a lot of time in the water. Choose a product that is labeled \"water resistant,\" and check the instructions on the bottle.  Dress your child in lightweight cotton clothing with long sleeves and long pants. SPF-rated clothing and hats are also a good idea to protect your child's skin when they're outdoors. Use a    beach umbrella  or similar object to help keep your child in the shade as much as possible.  Have them wear a hat with a wide brim.  Babies under 6 months of age should be kept out of direct sunlight. If adequate clothing and shade are not available, sunscreen may be used on small areas of the body, such as the face and the backs of the hands.

        "content": "By: Sarah Asch, MD, FAAP, FAAD & Matthew Mahoney, DO  Acne, the medical condition that causes \"pimples,\" is common and a normal part of growing up—especially in the teenage years. In fact, around 85% of people have acne when they're teens. Acne can affect many places on the body, including the face, neck, shoulders, upper back and chest. For some teens, acne is not bothersome. Other teens want to clear up their acne. For some teens, treating acne boosts self-esteem and helps build life skills around self-care. A smaller number of teens have more severe acne that is important to treat to prevent permanent scars.  Thankfully, there are options for everyone to help prevent and treat acne. Here's what you need to know. What causes acne in teens? \t The hair follicles (pores) in the skin contain oil glands, called sebaceous glands. The oil they produce is called sebum, which helps to lubricate the hair and skin. But changes during puberty can lead to acne:   \t More oil = clogged pores.  Increased levels of hormones during the teen years lead to more sebum production. This can cause the pores to become clogged up.\t Then, bacteria get busy.  Unfortunately, a normal, healthy bacteria on the skin named    C. acnes  loves all of the extra oil and gets to work multiplying, causing redness and irritation. What are different types of acne bumps called?\t There are four main types of acne bumps: \t Blackheads.  The medical term for these is \"open comedones,\" and they are pores that get clogged up with extra oil. These stay close to the skin's surface and have a top darker than the surrounding skin.\t Whiteheads.  These are also called \"closed comedones,\" and they are pores that get clogged up with the extra oil, close, and bulge out slightly from the skin's surface.\t Pimples.  These are the red bumps that form when the extra oil and    C. acnes  bacteria combine to clog up a pore more deeply in the skin. Sometimes the bacteria create pus and the red bump becomes a pustule.\t Nodules and cysts.  These are larger and often painful pimples that extend to the deeper layers of the skin. These are the ones that are most likely to lead to scarring. \t   H o w lon g do pim ples last? Without treatment, a pimple takes about two months to go through its entire cycle, from a little clog to a full-grown pimple and then to go away. Acne marks & scars After pimples go away, they often leave a red or brown mark that takes even longer to fade. These marks are called post-inflammatory discoloration. This can be one of the most frustrating parts of acne for many people, but the marks will fade eventually. Some pimples leave scars. These are indentations of the skin and can be permanent. If you are noticing this type of mark it is important to talk to your doctor about treatment to stop more scars from forming. What can make acne worse?\t   Hormones.  As mentioned above, teenage hormones lead to more oil production in the skin, which can lead to acne. Acne can also flare with the hormone increases that happen just before menstrual periods. \t Diet.  The role of diet in acne is not clear. A healthy, well-balanced diet is likely to be better for the skin, just as it is for the health of the rest of the body. Diets high in sugars and simple carbohydrates might contribute more to acne.\t Skin care products and cosmetics.  Some products, especially oil-based skin care products, can lead to acne if they clog up pores. Water-based or \"non-comedogenic\" products are less likely to cause acne. Anything that presses on the skin for a long time, including tight clothing or equipment like chinstraps on helmets, can cause worsening acne in that area. \t Stress.  While    stress  doesn't \"cause\" acne, there is a link between worse acne and stress. Research studies have shown that teenagers tend to have worse acne when school is stressful. Regular exercise, healthy sleep, and supportive relationships all help lower stress. Key tips to help prevent acne\t Wash the skin twice a day.  once in the morning and once in the evening. Use a gentle cleanser or soap with warm water and avoid harsh or gritty scrubs. \t Do \t   not  scrub the skin  with rough cloths or brushes, as this can further irritate the skin. Remember that acne is not caused by dirt on top of the skin but rather by extra oil combined with bacteria inside the skin. It cannot be scrubbed off. Scrubbing can lead to dryness and irritation and make acne worse. \t Avoid pinching, popping, or picking at pimples.  Manipulating the skin can make acne worse and lead to infections or scarring. How to treat acne If you think about what causes acne, you can also guess how to treat it. Remember that extra hormones cause more oil production, which leads to clogged pores. The extra oil combines with  C. acnes  bacteria to cause redness and irritation. Treatments are aimed at each of these parts of acne.  Types of acne medications\t Benzoyl peroxide.  This product is available in many acne-fighting products sold without a prescription. It helps to both kill the C. acnes  bacteria and reduce some of the oil production. Start with a lower strength (ranging from 3.5%-5%) wash once a day. Benzoyl peroxide can be used on acne anywhere on the body, including as a face wash or in the shower as a body wash for the chest and back. Watch out because benzoyl peroxide will bleach fabrics, so use an old towel and pillowcase. Ensure you completely dry your skin before putting on your favorite clothes.\t Hydrocolloid pimple patches.  These small stickers are becoming more popular, and can be effective for improving single pimples. They cover and protect the pimple while absorbing oil and bacteria from within it. Some have medications in them which can be irritating if used with other acne medications or washes.\t Antibiotics.  Antibiotics can be helpful for teens with pimples (either red bumps or pus-filled bumps). They work to kill the acne-causing C. acnes bacteria and help to fight against inflammation too. Doctors use antibiotic creams, lotions, solutions, or gels and antibiotic pills to help with pimples. Your doctor will tell you the details about how to use these.\t Topical retinoids.  This group of medicines for acne include products named adapalene, tretinoin, and tazarotene. They work to unplug the pores by removing the outermost layer of skin, improving acne. The most significant side effect is dryness of the skin. When first starting to use a retinoid, use it every other day or just a couple of times a week to limit the dryness, then increase how often you use it little by little. Using a moisturizer daily also helps with dryness.    Try the five-dot method for applying retinoid medicine. Use a small \"pea-sized\" amount of medication applied in five dots on different parts of the face. Then then rub the medication over the entire face, not just on the pimples you can see. This way you are preventing new pimples from developing.\t Hormonal treatments.  Certain contraceptive pills and a pill called spironolactone are used for female patients with acne. These pills work to block the effect of hormones in the skin so that there is less oil production and less acne.\t Isotretinoin.  For really severe acne, especially the kind that leads to scars, a pill called isotretinoin can be used. It works like retinoid creams to decrease the oil produced by the sebaceous glands in the skin. It is highly effective for severe acne and for acne that has not improved with other treatments. It requires close monitoring because taking it during pregnancy can lead to birth defects.\t What to keep in mind about acne treatment\t Acne takes at least two months to get better \t after you start treatment , so do not give up too soon! The red and brown marks left by pimples can take even longer to fade.\t There are many effective acne-fighting products available without a prescription, but start using them one by one  and little by little  to avoid irritating your skin.\t If your acne is more severe or causing scars, there are powerful medicines  to control it available from your doctor or a dermatologist.\t Most of these treatments do not \"cure\" the condition , and you must keep using the treatment regularly to prevent acne from returning.\t Many of these options can lead to dryness and a little skin peeling , so using an oil-free moisturizer every day is helpful.\t Sun protection is important  to help fade the red and brown marks and to protect against extra sensitivity associated with some treatments. There are some moisturizers with sunscreens in them that can be a good \"one-step\" option. Talk with your doctor Don't hesitate to talk with your pediatrician or pediatric dermatologist for more information about acne or any other health concerns.

        "content": "Doctors use the word tinea to describe a group of contagious skin infections caused by a few different types of fungi. They can affect many areas of the skin and depending on their location and fungal type, the infection has different names. \t Tinea capitis is a skin infection or ringworm of the scalp caused by a fungus called dermatophytes (capitis comes from the Latin word for head). It mostly affects children. \t Tinea corporis is ringworm of the body (corporis means body in Latin). In wrestlers this is often called tinea gladiatorum. \t Tinea pedis or athlete’s foot is an infection that occurs on the feet, particularly between the toes (pedis is the Latin word for foot). \t Tinea cruris or jock itch tends to create a rash in the moist, warm areas of the groin (cruris means leg in Latin). It most often occurs in boys when they wear athletic gear. \t Tinea versicolor or pityriasis versicolor is a common skin infection caused by a slow-growing fungus (Pityrosporum orbiculare) that is a type of yeast. It is a mild infection that can occur on many parts of the body. \t Although the name ringworm is attached to some of these conditions, worms are not involved in any of them. The infections are caused by fungi. \t Signs and Symptoms \t In many cases of ringworm and other tinea infections, circular, ring-shaped sores are formed, which is why the term ringworm is used. On the body, these lesions or patches may be slightly red and often have a scaly border. They may grow to about 1 inch in diameter. While some children have just one patch, others may have several of them. They tend to be itchy and uncomfortable. \t In ringworm of the scalp, itching may develop on the head, along with round and raised lesions. Hair loss can occur in patches. Some cases of scalp ringworm do not produce obvious rings and can be confused with dandruff or cradle cap. In a few cases, the child will have a reaction to the fungus and develop a large boggy area called a kerion. This looks like a pus-filled sore (abscess), but it is really an allergic reaction to the fungus. The infected area will heal once the fungus is treated. Steroids are often given to speed healing. Sometimes, bacteria can infect the area later. If this occurs, your pediatrician may advise the use of antibacterials. \t When fungi cause athlete’s foot, the skin can become itchy and red with cracking and flaking between the toes. This is most common in adolescents. \t Tinea infections are spread by skin-to-skin contact, most often when a child touches another person who is already infected. The fungi thrive in warm, damp environments and at times can be spread in moist surfaces, such as the floors of locker rooms or public showers. When a child sweats during physical activity, the moisture on the skin can increase the chances of a fungal infection. \t The incubation period for these infections is not known. \t When To Call Your Pediatrician \t Contact your pediatrician if your child has symptoms of a tinea infection. \t How Is The Diagnosis Made? \t Most tinea infections can be diagnosed by your pediatrician on visual examination of the affected area. The diagnosis can be confirmed by taking skin scrapings at the site of the infection—for example, by gently scraping a damp area of the scalp with a blunt scalpel or toothbrush—and testing the collected cells in the laboratory. Also, when one type of fungal infection is looked at in a dark room using a special blue light called a Wood’s lamp, it will have a fluorescent appearance. Not all of the fungi are fluorescent, so this test can’t be used to rule out the possibility of a fungal skin or scalp infection. \t Treatment \t Antifungal medications applied directly on the head are ineffective for treating ringworm of the scalp. Instead, your pediatrician may recommend giving your child antifungal medications by mouth, most often a medicine called griseofulvin, that should be taken for an average of 4 to 6 weeks. A variety of other medicines can be used. Washing your child’s hair with selenium sulfide shampoo can decrease shedding that could spread the infection to others. \t Over-the-counter antifungal or drying powders and creams are effective for other types of tinea infections, including athlete’s foot and tinea corporis. Your pediatrician may prescribe a cream for treating the rash associated with jock itch. Topical medications including clotrimazole and ketoconazole are used to treat ringworm of the body as well as tinea versicolor. \t What Is The Prognosis? \t Ringworm infections usually respond well to treatment within a few weeks, although they can sometimes come back. \t Prevention \t Good hygiene is important for preventing many tinea infections. For example, to avoid ringworm of the scalp, make sure your child shampoos often, and encourage him to avoid sharing hairbrushes, combs, hats, hair ribbons, and hair clips with other children. He should keep his skin and feet clean and dry, especially between the toes. Have your child wear sandals in locker rooms or at public showers or swimming pools. Give your youngster clean socks and underwear every day.",

        "content": "Warts are caused by a virus—the human papillomavirus (HPV). These firm bumps (although they also can be flat) are yellow, tan, grayish, black, or brown. They usually appear on the hands, toes, around the knees, and on the face, but can occur anywhere on the body. When they’re on the soles of the feet, doctors call them plantar warts. Although warts can be contagious, they appear infrequently in children under the age of two. \t Treatment \t Your pediatrician can give you advice on treating warts. Sometimes he will recommend an over-the-counter medication that contains salicylic acid or even treat them in the office using a liquid nitrogen–based solution or spray. If any of the following are present, he may refer you to a dermatologist. \t Multiple, recurring warts \t A wart on the face or genital area \t Large, deep, or painful plantar warts (warts on the soles of the feet) \t Warts that are particularly bothersome to your child \t Some warts will just go away by themselves. Others can be removed using prescription or nonprescription preparations. However, surgical removal by scraping, cauterizing, or freezing is sometimes necessary with multiple warts, those that continue to recur, or deep plantar warts. Although surgery usually has a good success rate, it can be painful and results in scarring. Laser treatment may help. The earlier the warts are treated, the better the chance of permanent cure, although there is always the possibility that they will recur even after treatment that is initially successful. \t If a wart comes back, simply treat it again the way you did the first time, or as directed by your pediatrician.

        "content": "By: Jacqueline Tran & Deepti Gupta, MD, FAAP   Vulvovaginitis is an irritation and swelling of skin in and around the vulva and vagina in the female genital area. It can cause redness, soreness, vaginal discharge and itchiness. Here's what parents need to know about vulvovaginitis, ways to help prevent it and how to help your child heal if they develop the condition. How common is vulvovaginitis? Vulvovaginitis is common and can occur in females of all ages. The skin around the vulva and vagina is very thin and easily irritated. This is especially true for young children, who may be more prone to the condition. Also, the warm and wet environment allows for bacteria and yeast to grow, and these germs irritate the skin and lining of the area.  What are some common causes vulvovaginitis in children and teens?  Toddlers and girls before puberty most commonly develop vulvovaginitis from staying damp around the crotch. The warm and wet environment allows for bacteria and yeast to grow, and these germs irritate the skin and lining of the area. Other common causes of vulvovaginitis include wearing tight-fitting underwear, harsh detergents or too much  soap , bubble baths and other products added to the bath, especially products with fragrance.  Foreign materials in the area, such as bits of toilet paper, can also cause vulvovaginitis. Teenagers and adults can also develop vulvovaginitis from irritation that comes with sexual activity.  Signs and symptoms of vulvovaginitis  The most common symptoms of vulvovaginitis include itchiness, vaginal discharge, redness, and irritation of the outer skin of the vulva and the lining of the  labia  and vagina. It is important to consider any new soaps, detergents, bath additives, clothes, or activities (like swimming or other sports) that might help to explain the new irritated rash.  Vulvovaginitis treatment and management options It is most important to keep the area clean and dry. Clean the area daily in a warm bath of plain water or a warm shower with water running over the area without exposing the lining of the vulva and vagina to any soaps. Gently pat the skin dry without rubbing hard. If the skin appears red and irritated, apply a thin layer of plain petroleum jelly to the skin which acts as a barrier. Avoid using any products with fragrance or any creams, lotions, or powders as these products may all add to the irritation. Also, avoid using packaged wipes while the skin is irritated as the ingredients in these wipes can make the rash worse. Prescription medicines are occasionally necessary to resolve the irritated skin or treat any associated infections.  How to prevent vulvovaginitis    To help prevent vulvovaginities, choose loose clothing, keep the crotch area clean and dry, and avoid harsh soaps, wipes, and products with fragrance.  Here are some other ways to help young children learn how to care for this easily irritated area & help prevent vulvovaginitis: Wiping from front to back after peeing and pooping  Washing hands after using the bathroom whether peeing or pooping Drying the area completely after showers, baths, or swimming Avoid sitting in wet or tight-fitting bathing suits or clothing for long periods of time  Use only water to clean the vulva and vagina  When to contact your pediatrician  If symptoms persist after 2 to 3 weeks, consider contacting your pediatrician to learn more about what treatment options might be right for your child.

        "content": "Warts are tiny, firm bumps on the skin caused by viruses from the human papillomavirus (HPV) family. Warts are contagious and commonly found in school-aged children. They rarely occur in children younger than 2 years. \t Signs and Symptoms \t Skin warts are dome shaped with a rough appearance and a yellow, tan, black, brown, or gray coloring. They can appear anywhere on the body, but most often they are found on the hands, including near or under the fingernails; toes; face; and around the knees. \t Warts also can occur on the soles of the feet, where they are often flat and painful. Your child may say she feels like she is walking on a pebble. Doctors refer to these manifestations as plantar warts. They may have tiny black dots on them, which are actually tiny, clotted blood vessels. \t Human papillomaviruses are spread by close physical contact. The virus often gets into the body through breaks in the skin. Swimming in public pools may increase your child’s risk of developing plantar warts. \t When warts occur on the genitals, they are considered a sexually transmitted disease caused by a type of HPV. They are spread during genital, oral, and anal sex with a partner who is infected. \t When to Call Your Pediatrician \t Let your pediatrician know if your child develops a wart on her face or genitals. If warts persist or spread or if they are painful, ask your pediatrician for medical advice. \t How Is the Diagnosis Made? \t Most warts, including genital warts, are diagnosed by their appearance. Genital warts can be identified by performing a biopsy that is sent to the laboratory for confirmation of an HPV infection. \t Treatment \t While warts will go away on their own without treatment, they can become painful if they are bumped, and some children are embarrassed by them. Your pediatrician may suggest applying an over-the-counter medicine containing salicylic acid to the warts. Prescription-strength chemicals are also available for removing them. Recently, duct tape has been shown to work against warts! If your child has multiple warts or they keep coming back, your doctor may recommend removing them surgically by scraping, cauterizing (cutting away the warts), or freezing them (with liquid nitrogen). There is a good success rate with the use of surgery, but it sometimes leaves scars. \t If your teenaged girl has genital warts, she should have a Pap smear to be sure there are no changes in the cells of the cervix. There is a link between genital warts and cancer of the cervix. Warts in the airways are also difficult to treat and often require referral to a specialist. \t What Is The Prognosis? \t Many warts last for months or years and then go away on their own or in response to treatment. The earlier the treatment is given, the greater the chances are of completely getting rid of the warts. \t Prevention \t There is no way to effectively prevent warts.",

        "content": "By: Laura Hollinger, MD, FAAP & Steven Lee, MD, FAAP An appendectomy is surgery to remove the appendix, a small, pouch-like organ attached to the colon. Your child may need an appendectomy if the appendix becomes infected. An infection of the appendix is called    appendicitis . How is an appendectomy be performed? Your doctor will discuss the surgery type with you. Surgery to remove the appendix can be done with a single incision on the abdomen. Surgery can also be done with small incisions using a camera and small surgical instruments (this is called laparoscopic surgery). Either type of surgery (open or laparoscopic) could be used to remove the appendix. These days, many surgeons use laparoscopic surgery to remove the appendix because the incisions are smaller and your child will have less pain. First, your child will be prepared for surgery. They will receive fluids in their IV and antibiotics to treat the infection of the appendix. Fluids and antibiotics are important to make sure your child is ready before surgery.  Your child will not be allowed to eat or drink anything for many hours before surgery. They cannot have any water, ice, chewing gum or anything else to eat or drink. This is because the stomach needs to be completely empty when they go to sleep with anesthesia.  How long will my child be in the hospital? If your child's appendix did not burst (not ruptured), then the infection was mild. It may be possible that your child goes home very soon after surgery. Your child may not need any more antibiotics or other medicines. Your child will be able to drink and eat. If your child's appendix did burst (ruptured), then the infection is more serious. Your child will be kept in the hospital for recovery. During recovery, your child will be given more antibiotics through their IV. They will be given liquids then solid food to eat when they feel better. They may be in the hospital for days after surgery. Once they have recovered, have no more fevers and are able to eat, your doctor will tell you when they can go home.  What do I need to do for my child when they go home? Your child will be encouraged to walk around as soon as possible after surgery. They may have a normal diet after surgery. \t Activities my child can do.  Your child should avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity for 1-2 weeks after surgery. They can return to school once they are not needing medicines for pain and have energy.\t Taking care of the wound.  The bandages should be kept on the incision for a few days after surgery. The bandages should also be dry and clean. The stitches used on the inside during surgery are usually the type that do not need removal. Your doctor will give you specific instructions.\t Medicines my child may need to take.  Your child may need mild pain medicine like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. They should be taken as described on the bottle if needed for    pain . If your doctor gives your child stronger medicines for pain, there will be specific instructions for how it should be given. Some children will need antibiotics too and your doctor will give them if necessary. When should I call the doctor? You should call your child's doctor if your child develops a fever, pain in the belly, vomiting, diarrhea or if the wounds look red or drains fluid. Sometimes children can have problems related to surgery for the appendix, which your doctor can check for and treat. Any problems typically happen soon after surgery. Examples include a wound infection, abscess, or bowel blockage.\t Wound infection. T his is when an infection forms at one of the surgery incisions. The incision will appear red, be painful to your child, and possibly drain pus or liquid. This may need treatment with antibiotics or drainage. You should call your child's doctor if you see redness or drainage at one of the surgical incisions. Abscess.  An abscess is a pus pocket that can sometimes form inside the abdomen. An appendix that had burst is a more serious infection and more likely to cause an abscess. If your child develops fevers, new belly pain or vomiting, you should call their doctor. Your child's doctor may order tests to determine if there is an abscess after surgery to remove the appendix. If an abscess is found, your child may need more antibiotics or drainage of the pus. Are there lasting effects from appendectomy? After surgery to remove the appendix, your child will return to normal. The appendix is not a vital organ, so your child will continue to grow up and be healthy without an appendix.

        "content": "By: David T. Schindel, MD FAAP & Humberto Lugo-Vincente, MD Biliary atresia  is a condition that affects a baby's bile ducts, tubes that carry digestive fluid from the liver to the intestines. The bile ducts may be too narrow, blocked or missing. Because of this, bile builds up in the liver and causes damage.  What is a Kasai operation? If your child's doctor suspects they may have biliary atresia, imaging studies can be helpful. However, surgery with examination of the bile ducts is the gold standard of diagnosis. A Kasai operation is a type of surgery to remove the diseased bile ducts to the base of the liver and re-establish bile flow from the liver using a portion of the child's intestine.  How is biliary atresia surgery performed in children? Either using an incision made below the ribs on the right of the abdomen or a laparoscopic technique, the bile ducts are first inspected. A study called a cholangiogram is performed to confirm the diagnosis of biliary atresia.  To perform a cholangiogram, the surgeon places a small tube into the    gallbladder , if present. Then they inject a medication that can help find the bile ducts using an X-ray machine.  If the gallbladder and bile ducts are not open and bile cannot drain, the child has biliary atresia. The surgeon will proceed to remove the very small or abnormal gallbladder and abnormal bile ducts where they connect with the liver. A piece of small intestine called the jejunum is then used to replace the bile ducts, making a connection between the liver and the intestine. This connection will hopefully re-establish bile drainage into the intestine, reversing the effects of the disease.      What happens before surgery? To prepare your child for surgery, they will get intravenous (IV) fluids to maintain hydration, sugar levels and nutrition. In addition, they'll be given IV antibiotics are provided to reduce infection. Blood products, such as red blood cells or platelets, might be needed during surgery.. When can my child go home after surgery? It is common for children having a Kasai operation to be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for recovery after surgery. Your child will be watched very closely for signs of bleeding and proof that bile is successfully draining from the liver into the intestine. Signs this is happening include the return of bile pigment (greenish color) to the stools as well as improvement in the baby's liver function tests.  Once your child's intestine function returns, they can start feeding again. Once their incision is healing properly, their liver functions are getting better, and your baby is tolerating a proper diet, the surgeon will likely then determine they are ready to go home. How do I care for my child after biliary atresia surgery? Unless there was a complication, your child's incision can be cleaned as you would the rest of their body. If your baby takes formula, there may be some changes your child's health care team will recommend after surgery. Some medicines that your child might need include steroids to reduce inflammation, oral antibiotics to avoid bile duct infections, and vitamins supplements. If your child stops eating, feels weak, has fewer wet diapers or develops a fever, they should return to the hospital.   What are possible complications with biliary atresia surgery? Complications may be divided into those occurring soon after the operation versus those occurring later. The most common early complication is a wound infection at the site of the incision. These infections can be treated with oral antibiotics alone but may also need more care to heal. Another type of infection that can occur at any point after a Kasai operation is called cholangitis. When bile flows through the new intestinal connection between the liver and bowel, a bile duct infection known as cholangitis can develop. Cholangitis typically causes fever and even the return of    jaundice . IV antibiotics are typically needed to treat cholangitis.  Over time scarring and abnormal bile drainage from the liver can cause progressive liver damage and more scarring of the liver. This scarring is referred to as hepatic fibrosis. If the scarring progresses, liver failure can result and create the need for a hepatic transplant. Biliary atresia is the most common cause of liver transplantation in children.  When will my child need to see the doctor again? At the time of discharge from the hospital, the surgeon will discuss a follow up plan with your family. Commonly, an office visit is scheduled two weeks after discharge from the hospital. Your child should also have follow-up visits with their pediatric surgeon and pediatric gastroenterologist. During the first years after surgery, visits to the doctor might be very frequent to monitor liver function along with growth and development. What is the long-term outlook after surgery? The outlook following a Kasai operation for the treatment of biliary atresia has been well studied. Most children will require close follow up by their pediatrician, who will closely monitor their growth and development. If your child is doing well after surgery, medication needs may be limited to only a daily multivitamin. About one-third of all children undergoing a Kasai operation will be long-term survivors. Unfortunately, two-thirds of children who've had a Kasai operation will ultimately need a liver transplant to resolve the effects of ongoing liver damage that result from the scarred bile ducts and liver.

        "content": "​​​​​​​​​By: Eveline Shue, MD, FAAP Cholecystectomy is a type of surgery to remove the  gallbladder ​, a small, hollow organ that stores digestive fluids. It is one of the most common surgeries among U.S. adults.  A growing number of children also have the procedure.​ Conditions it tr​​eats Gallstones causing blocked digestive fluids and swelling in the gallbladder (cholelithiasis) Gallbladder that isn't working well (biliary dyskinesia) How is gallbladder surgery perfor​​​med in children?\t Laparoscopic surgery.  Gallbladder surgery is usually done using a video camera and small incisions. There are usually between 2 and 4 incisions, each less than 1 cm in length. The stones and the gallbladder are removed in this surgery. \t Cholangiogram.  This may be performed as part of the operation if the surgeon feels it is necessary. It is done by putting dye into the bile ducts and taking x-rays of those ducts to see if there are stones stuck in them. \t Open surgery.  Sometimes there is too much infection around the gallbladder and it is not safe to do the surgery laparoscopically. If this happens, your surgeon may need to do the surgery with one bigger incision.  What happens before s​urger​​y? Doctors will want to make sure your child is as healthy as possible before surgery. If there is infection in the gallbladder, your child may be given antibiotics before surgery. For children with sickle cell anemia, blood transfusions may be needed before surgery to prevent a sickle cell crisis.  Patients are usually asked to take a shower or bath the night before surgery. Your child will also need to stop eating or drinking for at least a few hours before surgery.  When can my ch​​ild go home after surgery? If your child has laparoscopic surgery, they likely can go home the same day as the surgery, or the next. If a bigger incision and open surgery is needed, your child may need to stay in the hospital up to 5-7 days.  How do I care for my child at home after gallbladder​​​ surgery? \t Taking care of the wound.  Wounds should be kept clean and dry for 2 days. Most of the time, the stitches used in kids dissolve on their own and do not require removal. Your surgeon will give advice about how to care for the wounds. \t Limit activity while healing.  Your child should avoid intense activity and avoid heavy lifting for 2 weeks after a laparoscopic surgery, and 4-6 weeks after open surgery. \t Diet.  Most children can eat a normal diet after surgery. Sometimes, eating lots fatty foods may cause nausea, bloating, cramping and watery stools. These problems will likely go away in a few months as the body adjusts to not having a gallbladder. \t Medicines your child may need to take.  For a few days after surgery, Tylenol or ibuprofen may be used for pain. Sometimes, your doctor will give you a stronger pain medication to help with pain for the first few days after surgery. It is common for children to have constipation after surgery (trouble passing a stool). If this happens, your child may need to take medicine to make their stool soft. \t Problems to watch for during recovery.  Call your doctor if your child's pain gets worse, has a fever, vomiting, yellowing of the eyes or skin or if the wounds are red or draining fluid.  What are possible complications with gal​​lbladde​r surgery?​ Bleeding Infection​ Injury to the ducts draining the liver Injury to the blood vessels of the liver Leakage of bile from the ducts  These complications are rare, happening in less than 1% of surgeries. Your surgeon can discuss these with you.  When will my child need to see the doctor again? Children who have had gallbladder surgery will need to see the surgeon 2-3 weeks after surgery to make sure they are healing well. They should also continue to see their pediatrician regularly.  What is the long-term outlook after surgery? The long-term result is excellent after surgery. Rarely, some people may feel bloated or have loose stools after eating fatty foods after their gallbladders are removed. This is usually temporary. See your pediatric surgeon if your child experiences these symptoms.

        "content": "By: Janice Taylor ,MD, MEd, FAAP  As a baby boy grows in the womb, the testicles first develop in the abdominal cavity. Then, they work their way down into the scrotum, which is the sac of skin on the outside of the body that holds the testicles. When one or both of the testicles do not make it into the scrotum by the time a baby is born, the condition is called undescended testicle.  Children diagnosed with undescended testicles often need surgery to prevent certain health problems later. The surgery to repair an undescended testicle is called orchiopexy. What is undescended testicle repair surgery (orchiopexy)? Orchiopexy surgery is done to move a young boy's testicle(s) from their abdomen into the scrotum. Sometimes, just one surgery is needed. If the testicle is still in the abdomen and not close to the groin, however, your child may need two surgeries to get it into the right place. Your surgeon will tell you if this is what your child needs. Why does my child need surgery for an undescended testicle? Surgery to bring the testicle down into the scrotum is for more than just to make the sides \"match.\" If the testicle is not in the scrotum, it is difficult to check for abnormal lumps or tumors in the testicle, particularly later in life. Undescended testicles have a higher rate of getting certain types of cancer, so having them in an easy-to-find area is important.  There may also be worries about fertility in the child's future, especially if both testicles are undescended. Surgery to bring down the testicle(s) then gives the child the best chance to have children in the future.  If the testicle is not attached in the scrotum, there is a higher chance that it could twist on its blood vessels (called testicular torsion), with the risk of the testicle dying. If the undescended testicle is located abnormally up at the level of the pubic bone, it may have a higher risk of trauma since it is not in the scrotum. How is the surgery performed? For typical surgeries, a small incision is made in the groin area and the testicle is found. It is freed up and brought down into the scrotum. Usually, another small incision is made at the bottom of the scrotum so that the testicle can be brought down to the correct level, and sewn in place. If the undescended testicle is found when your child is an infant, surgery may be delayed until at least 6 months of age. If the testicle begins to drop on its own during the first 6 months, then many surgeons will allow more time to see if the testicle(s) will fully drop into the scrotum on their own by your child's first birthday. What happens around the time of surgery? Your surgeon's office will give you specific details, but generally your child should not have any solid food (including formula and milk) for 8 hours before surgery. Stop drinking clear liquids (apple juice, water) by 2 hours before surgery. If your child has other medical conditions, they may be required to come to the hospital the day before or stay longer after surgery. When can we go home after surgery? Unless your child needs to stay in the hospital overnight because of other medical conditions, you will be sent home from the recovery area on the day of surgery. What will recovery be like for my child? Instructions for care after surgery can be different based on the child or type of surgery.  Generally, pain will be helped with over-the-counter medicines like  acetaminophen . Your surgery team may have also injected numbing medicine under the skin of the incision while your child is asleep during surgery; this will help with pain on the first day. Expect some swelling or bruising in the surgery area, which can take up to a few weeks to go away. Most patients will be able to eat right after surgery. Bathing instructions will be given to you by your surgeon, but typically your child will be able to fully bathe within a week of surgery. Activity should be light for the first 1-2 weeks after surgery, and your surgeon will give you their specific instructions. When should I call the surgeon's office? Your surgeon will give you specific instructions for calling their office. Typically, the instructions are to call for: Bleeding or drainage from the incision(s) Redness around the incision(s) Fever above 101 F Vomiting Less peeing than usual or fewer  wet diapers  than usual Will my child need to see the doctor after surgery? You should notify your pediatrician's office of your child's surgery for any needed follow-up with them. For your surgeon, you will be given specific instructions to see them after surgery. They may want to see your child for a follow-up exam after any swelling has gone down after surgery.  If your child needs more than one planned operation for the undescended testicle, the surgeon may also want to see them again before the next surgery.

        "content": "​​​​By:  Diana Diesen, MD​ &  Samuel M. Alaish, MD, FAAP​​​ Some children have medical conditions related to their thyroid. This is an H-shaped gland at the base of the neck that makes hormones (chemicals in your blood). Thyroid hormone helps control metabolism, which is how quick or slow the body works. It involves temperature, heart rate, breathing, energy, sleeping, growth, gut, and many other parts of your body. Your doctor may decide your child's thyroid problem could be helped with surgery.  What are some common reasons for thyroid surgery?  Your child may see a thyroid surgeon for conditions such as: a lump (mass) in your thyroid an over-active thyroid (Grave's disease) that is not better with medicine a big thyroid (goiter)\t cancer  of the thyroid genetic conditions with a high risk of cancer (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia or MEN Syndromes. These are rare.)  What will the thyroid surgeon need to know?​​ Your surgeon will ask you about your child's medical history, your family history, and perform a physical examination. Make sure to tell your surgeon if your child has: Any lumps or masses in the neck  Previous thyroid problems or thyroid surgery ​Medications including vitamins and supplements Family history of thyroid problems Family history of calcium problems, belly or brain tumors If your child previously had cancer,            chemotherapy  (medicine for cancer), or radiation  What kind of tests need to be done to see if my child needs thyroid s​​urgery? ​Labs  The surgeon will get some blood tests to see how your child's thyroid is working. Is it working too much or too little? These results will help your child's surgeon decide what kind of radiology pictures to order.   Radiology  Ultrasound.  A thyroid ultrasound is a test that uses sound waves to look at the size and shape of the thyroid and things around the thyroid. This is the same kind of US used for pregnant women.  Radioactive iodine uptake scan (RAIU).  This test shows doctors how well your child's thyroid absorbs iodine. They can see if one part of the thyroid takes up more iodine than the rest of the thyroid.\t These studies can help decide what kind of surgery is needed. Sometimes other types of radiology studies are also needed, and your child's surgeon will talk to you about what those would be.​ Biopsy Fine needle aspiration.  If your child has a lump in their thyroid, the surgeon may recommend a biopsy called a fine needle aspiration. This is a procedure done in the radiology room with or without sedation (relaxing medicine). A small needle is used to pull out some thyroid cells, which are checked under a microscope by a pathologist (a doctor who specialized in looking at cells). Risks of problems from having this biopsy are small but may include mild discomfort, bleeding or a need for repeat biopsy. What should I expect the day of surgery? If you and your child's surgeon decide that surgery is the best treatment, your child will be scheduled for surgery to remove a part or all of your child's thyroid. Your child will be given general anesthesia, which means they will be fully asleep for the entire surgery. An incision is made on the front of your child's neck in a crease in the skin. Part (lobectomy) or all (total thyroidectomy) of the thyroid is removed. Your child's surgeon will take care to protect the tissue around the thyroid especially the parathyroid glands (calcium glands) and nerves near the thyroid. The incision is then closed with stitches and dressed with glue or medical tape.                  Risks​​ and possible complications of thyroid surgery include: \t   Bleeding\t Infection\t Damage to things near the thyroid like the nerve to the voice box (recurrent laryngeal nerve) or the calcium glands (parathyroid gland)\t Low to very low calcium requiring medication – this can be for a few days, weeks, months, or years\t Risk of lump coming back (recurring) ​​ What should I expect after surgery? Recovery Room As soon as your child wakes up after surgery, someone from the recovery room will call and take you to be with your child again. It may take a while for the anesthesia to wear off. Once awake, your child can eat and drink. Nausea after surgery is common. Depending on the extent of surgery, your child may stay in the recovery room for a couple of hours or your child's surgeon may want to monitor your child overnight in the hospital.  Your child may have some pain at the incision. Sometimes surgeons inject numbing medicine under the skin to help control pain. Your child will also be given pain medicine. Your child may have a sore throat from the breathing tube used for anesthesia during the surgery. That should be mild and go away in a day or two.  ​How do I care for my child at home? Know how to care of your child's wound. Help your child avoid picking, scratching or pulling at the incision.  No swimming until the skin has healed. Discuss with your child's surgeon when your child can bath normally (usually within a day or two) Understand any activity restrictions after surgery. After anesthesia, your child may feel sleepy or dizzy for a few hours. Limit their activity on the day of surgery. Do not let them drive, bike, or operate motorized vehicles ( ATV s, golf carts, boats,               scooters , etc.) The next day, your child can resume normal activities as tolerated. No contact sports allowed right after surgery. Your child should avoid being punched or kicked in their incision so the incision will heal well. Your child can return to work/school in about 2-7 days – it is up to your child's surgeon. Give medicines as ​directed. Pain medicine.  Usually               acetaminophen  not more often than every 4 hours for a day or two Calcium medicine.  If the calcium in your child's blood is low, the surgeon may want your child to take calcium to keep that level normal. Thyroid hormone.  If your child's entire thyroid is removed, your child will need to take thyroid hormone every day. This is very important for their body's energy and metabolism. Make sure they take the medicine as directed. Your child should never decide on their own to stop taking medicines. Make any needed follow-up appointments. Follow up with your child's surgeon as directed, usually in 1-4 weeks. Your child may need some blood work at that visit to check the amount of thyroid hormone and/or calcium in their blood. Your child's surgeon may also refer your child to an endocrinologist (thyroid medical doctor) to follow the thyroid hormone level for a longer time. Know how to reduce the appearance of scars. You may use sunblock over your child's incision after the wound has healed (talk to your child's surgeon). Do not put sunblock on before the wound heals - it may hurt or turn red and get irritated. After the skin is healed, sunscreen will help prevent the wound from leaving a darker scar. Keep using sunscreen on the wound for the first year after surgery, especially when the scar is exposed to a lot of sun. After your child's wound has healed, gently massaging the scar may help fade its appearance.​ You may also consider using over-the-counter ​silicone gel or tape to help fade the scars. Once the wound has healed, apply twice a day for 3 months. ​ When should I​ call the surgeon's office? Be sure to call the surgeon if your child has:  A lot of swelling or bleeding from the incision Redness or drainage from incision. This could be a sign of an infection. Fever greater than 101.5 (38.5 degrees Celsius). This could be another sign of an infection.  Numbness or tingling around lips or fingertips. This could be a sign of low calcium.​ More Information\t Managing a Child's Pain After Surgery ​​About Dr. Diesen Diana L.

        "content": "​​​​​​By: Henry Chang, MD, FAAP Everyone is born with a small opening in the abdominal muscles where the umbilical cord connects. This usually closes up on its own. When it doesn't, depending on whether it is causing problems, your child's doctor may recommend umbilical hernia surgery (herniorraphy). Here is some information about the procedure and what to expect if your child needs it. How is umbilical hernia surgery performed in children? Usually, a small incision is made below the belly button, and the contents within the bulge are pushed back into the belly. The hernia hole is closed using stitches. The extra skin in the belly button from the hernia is usually stitched in place and allowed to scar in place there. In children, patches or mesh are not usually used. What happens before surgery? You will be instructed not to give your child any solid food for 8 hours before surgery and to stop clear liquids (liquids you can see through, not formula or milk) 2 hours before surgery (ask your doctor's office for specific times). Will my child have any pain?  Your child may have some pain where the incision was made. Some surgeons inject numbing medicine at that area to control pain. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen are usually enough to control the pain from an umbilical hernia surgery. Rarely, your child's surgeon may give you a prescription for stronger pain medicine to use. How soon after surgery can I be with my child? As soon as your child wakes up after surgery, someone from the recovery room will call you, and you will be able to be with your child again.​  When can my child go home after surgery? Umbilical hernia surgery is usually done as an outpatient, which means that your child will likely be able to go home the same day as the surgery. Rarely, an overnight stay may be required for your child's safety depending on how your child is doing after surgery or if your child has other medical issues.  How do I care for my child at home after umbilical hernia surgery? Instructions for home will be different depending on the hospital, surgeon, age of your child, and the actual surgery. Usually, most children are able to eat regular food after surgery, return to school in 3-4 days after surgery, and return to sports in 2-4 weeks after surgery. Your child's surgeon will give you instructions specific for your child. When should I call the office? Bleeding or drainage from the incision Redness around the incision Swelling around the incision Fever above 101° F Vomiting Worsening pain Less peeing or fewer            wet diapers  than usual\t   You will receive specific instructions for follow up with the surgeon when your child goes home after surgery.

        "content": "What is Smokeless Tobacco? Chewing tobacco, snuff, snus, and dissolvable tobacco in the shape of sticks, pellets, and strips are all types of tobacco products that are not smoked but used in other ways. All types of smokeless tobacco contain nicotine and chemicals that may cause cancer (carcinogens).  Chewing Tobacco Chewing tobacco comes in 3 forms: Loose leaves Plugs Twists or rolls A piece (plug, wad, or chew) of tobacco is placed between the cheek and gum. Users chew on it for several hours and spit out the tobacco juices and saliva as they build up.  Snuff and Snus Snuff and snus are ground tobacco. Moist snuff and snus are sold in cans or sachets (pouches that look like tea bags). Users put a pinch  of moist snuff between the cheek or lip and gum. Sachets are placed between the cheek and gum. Dry snuff is a powdered form sold in cans. A pinch of dry snuff can be placed in the mouth or sniffed up the nose.  Other Forms of Smokeless Tobacco The newest forms of smokeless tobacco are finely ground dissolvable tobacco that is flavored and shaped into sticks, pellets, or strips. These forms melt in the users' mouth within 3 to 30 minutes, delivering nicotine. These new stick forms of smokeless tobacco contain 3 times more nicotine than an average cigarette. These forms of tobacco are not widely available as other types, and tobacco companies have been known to target specific areas to test these products out.  Smokeless Tobacco is Addictive Nicotine in smokeless tobacco is what gives users a buzz. It also makes it very hard to quit. Every time smokeless tobacco is used, the body gets used to the nicotine and starts to crave it. Craving is one of the signs of addiction. Another sign of addiction is called tolerance. This is when the body adjusts to the amount of tobacco needed to get a buzz. With continued use, more and more tobacco is needed to get the same feeling. Many smokeless tobacco users say it is harder to quit smokeless tobacco than cigarettes.  Smokeless Tobacco is Not Safe Some people believe smokeless tobacco is OK because it does not cause health problems from smoke and smoking. This does not make smokeless tobacco safe, however. Some smokeless tobacco delivers more nicotine than cigarettes, making addiction more likely. There are also direct effects of smokeless tobacco on the mouth.\t Bad breath.  Smokeless tobacco can give you really bad breath and discolored teeth. This will not help anyone's social life.\t Dental problems.  Smokeless tobacco's direct and repeated contact with the gums causes the gums to recede and become diseased, leading to loose teeth. Many forms of smokeless tobacco also contain sugar. This mixes with the plaque on the teeth to form acid that eats away at tooth enamel to cause cavities and chronic painful sores.\t Cancer.  Cancer of the mouth (including the lip, tongue, and cheek) and throat can occur most often at the spot in the mouth where the tobacco is held. Surgical removal of cancer is often needed, and parts of the face, tongue, cheek, or lip must often be removed too.\t Leukoplakia.  A white, leathery-like patch called leukoplakia may form in the mouth. The patches vary in size and shape and can become cancerous. If you have a patch in your mouth, your doctor should examine it right away.  Other harmful effects: \t Heart problems.  The constant flow of nicotine into your body causes many side effects including increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, and sometimes irregular heartbeats, which may increase risk for sudden death from a condition (ventricular arrhythmias) in which the heart does not beat properly.\t Nicotine poisoning.  The new forms of smokeless tobacco look like candy or breath strips, making them attractive to all ages, even children. While tobacco from a cigarette tastes bitter and unpleasant, the new forms are minty and flavorful, increasing their potential for poisoning.\t Smokeless Tobacco is Popular with Youth, Too   Smokeless tobacco is not used by adults alone—recent surveys from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have shown that youth are using smokeless tobacco more frequently, and in addition to other types of tobacco products. \t The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that prices for tobacco products be raised to discourage use by youth and that use of tobacco products in media (TV, movies, video games) be banned. The AAP supports a movement to \t \t  eliminate smokeless tobacco use by Major League Baseball players . A few cities have already banned smokeless tobacco from their baseball parks.  Tips to Quit Trying to quit can be difficult, but it is not impossible. Here are some tips: Pick a quit date and throw out all of your smokeless tobacco products. Ask for help. You can successfully quit with help and support! Call your doctor. Go online to a smokeless tobacco quitting resource, such as        \t http://mylastdip.com . Call a national toll-free telephone counseling resource, such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Ask your friends, family, teachers, and coaches for support and encouragement. Tell friends you are quitting and ask them to not offer you smokeless tobacco or other nicotine products. Ask a friend to quit with you. Chew on something else. A few good examples are sugarless gum, pumpkin or sunflower seeds, or apple slices. Stay busy with healthier activities. You could work on a hobby, listen to music, or volunteer your time. Exercise can help relieve any tension caused by quitting. Try biking, walking, running, or other sports. Everyone is different, so develop a personalized plan that works best for you. Set realistic goals so you will be more likely to achieve them. Reward yourself. Save the money that you would have spent on smokeless tobacco and use it for something special. Treat yourself to your favorite restaurant, a special purchase, or an event. Spend time with family and friends who are supportive.  Early Signs of Oral Cancer Your chances of being cured are higher if oral cancer is found early. Check your mouth often, looking closely at the places where you hold the tobacco. See your doctor right away if you have any of the following: A sore that bleeds easily and does not heal A lump or thickening in your mouth or neck Soreness or swelling that does not go away A red or white patch that does not go away Trouble chewing, swallowing, or moving your tongue or jaw If you use smokeless tobacco, your doctor and dentist should carefully examine your mouth at each checkup.

        "content": "E-cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product among middle- and high-school students.  These electronic devices, also known as e-cigarettes, vapes, vape pens, personal vaporizers, e-cigars, pod systems, mods and e-hookah, are not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking. E-cigarettes can be hard to recognize. Not all e-cigarettes look alike, and vaping is easy to hide. Here's what parents need to know. What are e-cigarettes? E-cigarettes produce an aerosolized liquid (vapor) that usually contains nicotine and other chemicals inhaled by the user. This is called vaping.  The liquid solution used in e-cigarettes, sometimes called vape juice or e-liquid, usually contains nicotine and other chemicals. E-cigarettes can be used to smoke or \"vape\"    marijuana products , herbs, waxes and oils.  Vape \"juice\" or e-liquid is often flavored. This makes it appealing to children and adolescents. In fact, more than  85%  of young users favor the candy, fruit and mint flavors that vape makers have formulated for their tastes. While flavors were nationally banned in 2019, this ban excludes mint and menthol flavors. This ban excludes disposable e-cigarette devices, which are sold in many appealing flavors and are relatively inexpensive. and are now the most popular type of e-cigarette used by adolescents. Parents, share this video with your teen:\t   What do e-cigarettes look like?\t E-cigarettes can be hard to recognize. They may resemble traditional tobacco products like cigarettes, cigars, pipes, or other common gadgets like pens, flashlights, USB flash drives, fidget spinners, gaming controls, car key fobs,    smart watches  and even asthma inhalers. In fact, the    U.S. Food and Drug Administration  has issued warnings to several companies for marketing 15 different e-cigarette products packaged to look like toys, food or cartoon characters that were likely to promote use among adolescents.  How popular are e-cigarettes? In 2022, e-cigarettes remained the most common tobacco product used by high school (16.5%) and middle school (4.5%) students in the last 30 days. And more than a quarter (27.6%) of current youth e-cigarette users say they use an e-cigarette product every day.  Children are exposed to e-cigarette advertising    online  and on TV, in magazines and billboards. Although it is illegal for e-cigarettes to be sold to youth under age 21, they can be ordered online. Why e-cigarettes and vaping are harmful & addictive Nicotine side effects & future substance use The nicotine found in most e-cigarettes is addictive and can harm brain development.  The more kids vape, the harder it is for them to stop. Using nicotine in adolescence can    harm  the parts of the brain that control attention, learning, mood and impulse control. Some e-cigarettes marketed as containing 0% nicotine have been found to contain nicotine. Youth who use e-cigarettes are more likely to smoke traditional cigarettes in the future.  Using nicotine in adolescence may also increase the risk for future substance use disorders. E-liquid from e-cigarettes and refill packs    can contaminate  skin, leading to nicotine poisoning.  Symptoms of nicotine poisoning include vomiting, sweating, dizziness, increased heart rate, lethargy, seizures and difficulty breathing. The most popular e-cigarettes contain highly concentrated  nicotine  salts  that deliver much more nicotine that traditional cigarettes.  Other health harms from vaping Beyond nicotine, the solution in e-cigarette devices and vapor contains harmful chemicals like    antifreeze   (made from one of two chemicals: propylene glycol or ethylene glycol), diethylene glycol and aldehydes (like formaldehyde). Formaldehyde is ranked as one of the top cardiovascular toxins also found in cigarette smoke.   \"E-juice\" may also contain cancer-causing chemicals, heavy metals and ultrafine particles  that can get deep into the lungs.\t Secondhand smoke /vapor from e-cigarettes is harmful to growing lungs.  In fact, studies show long-term effects on lung health, function and development. In some cases, e-cigarette devices have    exploded , causing burns or fires.  Vaping & lung injury: what is EVALI? In 2019, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention began looking into an    outbreak  of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) or vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI). By February 2020, there had been more than 2,800 hospitalizations and 68 deaths from EVALI across the United States.  Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing e-cigarette or vaping products was linked to most EVALI cases. So was Vitamin E acetate, an additive in vape cartridges e-liquids. Emergency department visits related to e-cigarette, or vaping, products have sharply declined in recent years, but the CDC continues to monitor reports. Are e-cigarettes a good way to help quit smoking? E-cigarettes are not recommended as a way to    quit smoking . They are not yet regulated nor approved for smoking cessation by the    U.S. Food and Drug Administration .The long-term health effects to users and bystanders are still unknown.  The best way to protect your children is to never smoke or vape near them. Talk with your doctor about quitting all tobacco. Never smoke indoors, in your car, or in places where children spend time. Remember It's important to help protect children and teens from using or being exposed to the harmful vapor from e-cigarettes. Talk with your pediatrician for more information about these products and keeping your child safe and healthy. Your regional Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit ( PEHSU ) also have staff who can also talk with you about environmental toxins.

        "content": "​​A device that heats tobacco without burning claims to be safer than cigarettes. Don't be fooled into thinking it's harmless! There is no safe type of tobacco use.  These heat-not-burn tobacco products became legal in the United States in 2019. They are different from vape pens,    pod-b​ased devices  like JUUL, and    e-cigarettes .  What is I​QOS? \t IQOS is a brand of heated tobacco products that is being marketed as \"a better alternative to smoking.\" Because the tobacco is heated, the company claims that it has less chemicals than burned tobacco. These claims are based solely on research conducted by the tobacco industry. Independent studies are needed to help understand the health effects of using heat-not-burn devices. The IQOS heat-not­-burn device uses a disposable tobacco unit called called a \"HEET\" or \"HeatStick\" filled with compressed ground tobacco, which is inserted into an electronic holder. Each \"HeatStick\" contains about the same amount of nicotine as one cigarette. An electronic heat element warms the stick and releases an aerosol that the user inhales. ​ ​ Facts about heat-not-burn tobacco devices: They produce an aerosol that contains nicotine, chemicals, additives, and flavorings by heating tobacco. They contain about the same amount of nicotine as traditional cigarettes.  They are available in convenience stores and specialty shops. They are NOT the same as e-cigarettes: these products use tobacco to deliver nicotine, whereas e-cigarettes use a liquid to deliver nicotine.  They give off      secondhand  aerosol that is unsafe to breathe (like a cigarette).  Heated tobacco products are NOT safe! \t Heated tobacco products contain tobacco.  There is no safe type or level of tobacco use, and there is no evidence that heated tobacco products are safer than traditional cigarettes.\t They also contain many chemicals and components that have been designated as harmful by the FDA, including:  Carbon Monoxide Nicotine Heavy metals like arsenic, lead, and mercury Acetone (found in nail polish remover) Ammonia (found in fertilizers and household cleaners) Benzene (found in gasoline) This device can lead teens to become lifelong smokers.  Companies that make products like e-cigarettes and vape pens claim they can help smokers quit. But evidence is showing they lead to traditional cigarette use and are a way for the tobacco industry to attract new customers.\t Beware of their sale to youth.  Heated tobacco products are sleek, high-tech devices that are being designed and marketed in ways that are known to attract youth. While the legal age to buy tobacco products, including IQOS, is 21, online stores don't always ask for proof of age. \t Heated tobacco products are highly addictive:  IQOS and other heated tobacco products contain nicotine. Teens and young adults are easily addicted to nicotine. The US Surgeon General has declared that youth use of nicotine in any form is unsafe. \t Menthol flavors are used to lure teens:  For decades, the tobacco industry has used menthol and other flavors to attract young smokers. Menthol masks the harshness of cigarette smoke, making them easier to smoke and harder to quit. Menthol cigarette use is more common among young smokers than other age groups.

        "content": "Fewer teens today      smoke  cigarettes than twenty years ago, but more are discovering new—and old—ways to use tobacco, including hookah, that are no less harmful to their health.   What is hookah? Hookah ( also called argilah, nargile, and hitboo ) is the traditional name for waterpipes that were first used centuries ago in South Asia and the Middle East. A social and often shared form of tobacco use, hookah smoking has been gaining popularity among teens and young adults in the United States.  How does it work? Typically, groups of people sit around a hookah to smoke a shredded tobacco mixture known as      sisha , which is usually sweetened with fruity or candy flavors. The hookah's vase-like tower is heated near the top by lighting charcoal or bits of wood. Smoke and vapor from the combusted tobacco bubble through the hookah's water chamber and into one or more attached hoses from which users inhale before passing it to the next person in the group.   Smoking hookah is not safe. Because smoke from the tobacco passes through water, many people mistakenly believe hookahs are safer than cigarettes. However, studies show hookah does not effectively filter out harmful substances from the smoke. Hookah smokers may end up breathing in higher amounts of nicotine, metals, and toxic chemicals. Germs are also spread on the hoses' shared mouthpieces. Here are some important facts about hookah: One hookah session is the same as smoking 100 or more cigarettes . Hookah sessions can last half an hour or more, and the amount of smoke typically inhaled during this time is 100-200 times greater than the smoke inhaled from smoking one cigarette. Many of the same toxins that are inhaled in a cigarette are also breathed in through a hookah. Individuals may experience a rapid heart rate, increased blood pressure, or even irregular heartbeats. In the long term, it also puts you at increased risk for several types of tobacco-related cancers that strike the lungs, bladder and other organs, as well as respiratory diseases. Poisonous and addictive chemicals are in hookah smoke . Carbon monoxide, arsenic, selenium, mercury, lead, benzene, and other chemicals in hookah smoke can reach dangerous levels during a single session. These chemicals have been shown to be especially dangerous for pregnant women and children. Hookah leads to addiction . Research shows that over 95% of the nicotine is still available when using hookah and is not filtered out by the water chamber. This is more than enough to cause addiction. People who smoke hookah are much more likely to begin smoking cigarettes. One            study  using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data found that young adult hookah smokers were more than twice as likely to try cigarettes than nonsmokers. Hookah also has been linked to increased alcohol and marijuana use. Sharing more than smoke . Because hookahs come into direct contact with the mouth and are shared by multiple smokers, infectious diseases of the lungs, mouth, lips, and gums can be spread to other people during a session. Contagious diseases ranging from oral herpes to the flu might be passed along, and more dangerous illnesses such as tuberculosis and hepatitis have been linked to Hookah use. Discuss the dangers of hookah. According to the CDC, tobacco use remains our country's leading cause of preventable disease and death. Tobacco use almost always begins during youth and young adulthood. It's important to consider the health risks associated with hookah and other forms of tobacco smoking and to have a discussion with your family about it.

        "content": "​​Thirdhand smoke is a danger to children. People with breathing problems, pregnant women, the elderly, and animals are also vulnerable to thirdhand smoke.  The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that all children be protected from tobacco smoke and offers the following information and suggestions to prevent exposure to thirdhand smoke. What is Thirdhand Smoke? The left-over pollution after a cigarette is put out The smoke residue can stick to dust, furniture, carpeting, car seats, hair, or clothes Secondhand smoke  particles are released into the air, combine with particles normally in the atmosphere (i.e., nitrous acid or ozone) and forms a new compound called nitrosamines, which are released into the air as cancer-causing chemicals Facts about Thirdhand Smoke: 43% of smokers (65% of nonsmokers) believe that thirdhand smoke causes harm to children. There is  no  safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke. Thirdhand smoke contains more than 250 chemicals. Homes and cars  where people have smoked can smell like cigarettes for a long time due to the thirdhand smoke left on surfaces. Decontaminating a home or car that was used by a smoker may require expensive professional cleaning as it can stain walls, floors, and the smell can remain in dry wall, insulation, and other building materials. Smoking in different rooms using fans, or smoking in front of an open window does not prevent thirdhand smoke. Babies and children can be harmed because they breathe in toxic chemicals when they crawl on floors, sit in cars, or are held by adults—thirdhand smoke can settle on these surfaces. Pets are also at risk,  because the chemicals from smoke stay in their fur or feathers. How to Protect Against Thirdhand Smoke: Do not allow smoking inside your home or car. Do not allow smoking near you, your children, or your pets. Ask anyone who cares for your child or pet to follow these rules—and tell them why. E-cigarette vapor or aerosol also contains chemicals. Do not let anyone use e-cigarettes in your home, car, or near your child or pet. The only way to completely protect against thirdhand smoke is to  quit . The AAP recommends talking to your child's pediatrician about ways to keep your child healthy.

Knowing that it will help improve the health of your children may help give you more motivation to quit and stay free from tobacco. There are many options out there to assist you in your quit efforts. Note:  Though the information below talks mostly about smoking, the information can be helpful for users of other tobacco products as well. Reasons to Quit   Take your pick!  Quitting smoking is one of the best things you can do for yourself and your loved ones. Smoking not only harms your health, but it hurts the health of those around you: exposure to secondhand smoke increases the risk of lung cancer and heart disease in healthy nonsmokers. Babies and children raised in a household where there is smoking have more ear infections, colds, bronchitis, and other lung and breathing problems than children from nonsmoking families.  When you quit smoking, your body will immediately notice the difference. Your blood pressure will return to more normal levels, and your sense of taste and smell will begin to improve. Your risk of diseases will decrease. Your clothes and home will smell better. You will save money. You will have accomplished a major goal that takes a lot of strength and effort to meet. Whatever your reasons are to quit, write them down. Several times. Put those reasons around in places where you usually keep your tobacco products (next to the door where your cigarettes used to be, on the patio table where you can of dip was, in the pocket of your purse where you kept your lighter). When you reach for your tobacco products without thinking, you'll instead find your reasons to quit, and this will help you resist the urge. Cessation Aids  There are pills, lozenges, patches, inhalers, and gum that may help you gradually decrease your tobacco use. Some people prefer to use these items to aid them in gradually becoming independent from tobacco. As several of these aids require a prescription, you may need to speak to your doctor. Tips, Tricks & Tools  No matter how tough quitting seems, remember that you are not the first to try it. Many other people have quit, and can offer insight and helpful advice to aid your efforts, including: National Cancer Institute Centers for Disease Control and Prevention American Cancer Society Do-it-yourself Quit Plans  If you do not want to go to an in-person group, or that is not an option, you can use online tools to help keep you on the path to quitting. One example is ​ The EX Quit Smoking Program . ​Specific Populations  Some groups of people have a more difficult time quitting than others. There are quit resources created  especially for these groups . Group Forums  These communities will enable you to exchange thoughts, ideas, and encouragement with others who are trying to quit: QuitNet Become an EX Other Resources 1-800-QUIT-NOW — a toll-free number that can be called anytime, from anywhere, to get help with staying quit. State-specific information from the AAP  — Information about contacts within each state, including the state's tobacco control program, and a listing of county health departments which may be able to assist with in person cessation and support groups. SmokefreeTXT  — For anyone who would rather get their quit info via text message, SmokefreeTXT sends six weeks of quit texts to the person's cell phone.

        "content": "Pod-based      e-cigarette  devices, are fourth generation e-cigarettes that have become very popular in recent years, especially among young people. Examples include JUUL, Suorin, Phix, Stig, and Smok.  Using pod-based e-cigarettes can put kids' health at risk in several ways. How are pod-based e-cigarettes different from other e-cigarettes?\t There are many different types and forms of      tobacco products  on the market today. Pod-based e-cigarette devices look the most different from traditional cigarettes. Small and sleek, these products can look a lot like a computer flash drive or pen. This makes it tricky for adults to recognize them right away as      vaping  tools. Pod-based e-cigarette devices are easy to hide in a fist or a pocket. They can even be plugged into a laptop's USB slot to recharge. How do pod-based e-cigarette devices work? Pod-based e-cigarette devices are battery operated. They work by heating a pod of e-liquid or \"juice\" that contains nicotine, flavorings and other      chemicals . When heated, the liquid creates an aerosol or vapor that users inhale.  Why should parents be concerned about pod-based e-cigarette devices?\t These devices come in flavors that appeal to kids.  For many years, tobacco companies have used candy-like flavors to attract young people to smoke. A recent federal ban on flavors still excludes mint and menthol flavors. Furthermore, this ban excludes disposable devices (for example, Puff Bars). Disposable pod-based devices are sold in a variety of appealing flavors, are relatively inexpensive, and are increasingly popular with teens. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention            research , middle and high-school students say that flavor is a big reason they use e-cigarettes.\t They are even more addictive than other types of e-cigarettes.  Pod-based e-cigarette devices contain nicotine salts, which are designed to deliver more than twice the amount of nicotine compared to other e-cigarettes. Nicotine is the chemical that causes addiction. These high amounts are a serious concern for youth, who are already more likely than adults to become addicted to nicotine. The chance of addiction is so high that the U.S. Surgeon General has warned that the use of nicotine by youth in any form is unsafe.\t Pod-based e-cigarettes raise the risk of becoming a regular cigarette smoker.  Research shows that young people who use e-cigarettes are more likely to begin using traditional            tobacco  cigarettes. \t Using these devices are common in schools and college campuses.  Teachers report that students are using pod-based e-cigarettes in classrooms, hallways, and school restrooms. They also share the devices with friends. This kind of social use encourages kids who don't smoke to try e-cigarettes. It also lets students who are too young to buy e-cigarettes legally, or who could not otherwise afford them, use them through classmates. \t \t  Protecting children and adolescents from the harms of e-cigarettes Pediatricians are particularly concerned about the threats to child and adolescent health posed by e-cigarettes, including heightened risk of nicotine-dependence and other health concerns related to vaping. The American Academy of Pediatrics has joined with other organizations to urge the U.S. Food & Drug Administration to take immediate action to protect children and teens from e-cigarettes. We continues to work with families and policymakers to help make sure that these devices are kept out of the hands of children.

        "content": "​​​​By: Brian Jenssen, MD, FAAP  Parents want their children to live long, healthy lives. This means helping kids embrace good habits early and warning them about choices that will harm them, including tobacco use.  We've made real progress since the mid-1960s, when a key government report held cigarette smoking responsible for      a 70% increase  in mortality among smokers vs. nonsmokers. But tobacco use is still the single greatest cause of preventable deaths in the U.S.—and our kids are definitely at risk. In fact, 90% of tobacco users began using the substance before age 18, a time when the body and brain are especially vulnerable to addiction. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) sees the explosion of new tobacco and nicotine products as a serious threat to child and teen health. Here's why we strongly support measures that will help keep these products out of kids' hands and make it easier for those who develop tobacco use disorder to get the treatment they need to quit.  Why we're concerned about kids & tobacco Cigarettes are not the only threat to our kids' health.  More than 16% of high school students report current use of a tobacco product—​and many use more than one kind. Roughly 2.5 million young people      used e-cigarettes  in 2022, breathing in toxins and fine particles known to damage lung tissues and cause cancer. Hundreds of thousands of kids smoked      hookah​ , equivalent to smoking 100 cigarettes in a typical one-hour session. And nearly 1 in 10 middle schoolers and 2 in 10 high schoolers used some form of      smokeless tobacco  and      little cigars  (often flavored) are a growing favorite among young smokers.  There is NO safe form of tobacco, especially for growing brains and bodies.  Tobacco products contain      nicotine , the highly addictive substance that makes it so hard to quit once kids start. Nicotine use in adolescence can      harm parts of the brain  that control attention, learning, mood and impulse control. There's also evidence that kids who use nicotine will face greater risks of other substance use disorders later in life. Even though e-cigarettes (vapes) are technically tobacco-free, most contain nicotine derived from tobacco. That's why the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies them as a tobacco product.  Makers of tobacco products are spending billions to reach our kids. Fruit and candy flavorings, celebrity endorsements and campaigns on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat are just some of the tactics used to      entice kids  to try tobacco-based products. Earlier restrictions on cigarette ads don't apply to these products, so marketers are also free to advertise in mainstream media. Retail displays, event sponsorships, free samples and even scholarship contests have been used to engage young consumers. AAP tobacco policy recommendations to help young people live healthier lives  As pediatricians, we have taken a strong stand in favor of laws, programs and practices that will keep children and teens from using tobacco products and help them quit if they do. We align with health officials, parents, caregivers and educators who recognize the lifelong health risks of tobacco use and want to encourage kids to live tobacco-free.  Here what we recommend:\t Kids should have access to effective treatment programs that can help them quit.  Right now, many insurers do not cover tobacco treatment for people under 18. Regulations that require coverage for these services, and reimbursement for health provid​ers who prescribe these services, will help young people break the tobacco habit early in life. Programs should be geared to the needs of young people to ensure they work.\t We need more research on how to prevent early tobacco use.  New studies can help us pinpoint the best ways to persuade kids to avoid tobacco (or quit). We urgently need research focused on kids living in communities where racism, discrimination and stigma are high, because these young people are disproportionately harmed by tobacco.\t Price increases should be used to discourage kids from using tobacco.  Studies show that youth and young adults are 2 to 3 times more sensitive to higher prices than adults. Higher taxes on tobacco will keep many from ever using tobacco taking up the habit while providing revenues to support tobacco control programs.\t The FDA should regulate all tobacco and nicotine products.  The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act gave the FDA the authority to do this in 2009. However, delays in reviewing the health impact of e-cigarettes and other products have given manufacturers a head start in marketing to young people. We encourage the FDA to set strict product standards, review new tobacco products before they hit the market and require new warning labels to discourage young users.\t We need to enforce tobacco control laws already on the books.  In 2019, Congress            raised the legal age for purchasing all tobacco products to 21 . But unless we hold retailers strictly accountable, the law will have little effect.\t Added flavors, including menthol, should be banned from tobacco products.  More than 80% of young people say the first tobacco product they ever tried was flavored. When asked why they use tobacco products, including vapes (which offer thousands of flavor choices), they consistently say they like the taste. Blocking manufacturers from using flavor additives will make these products less appealing to kids.\t Comprehensive tobacco-free laws should be adopted to protect kids wherever they live, learn, play, work and visit.  In many countries, regulations and practices that reduce            secondhand  and            thirdhand  smoke have been linked with lower rates of premature birth, asthma and other health problems in children. Regulations and guidance that keep our cars, homes, schools and other spaces smoke-free will safeguard kids' health.\t Ads for tobacco products should not be visible to kids.  Closing legal loopholes that allow manufacturers to promote e-cigarettes and other tobacco products,            especially online , will reduce the chances that kids will try them. Restrictions on retail displays, celebrity endorsements, free samples and ads placed in music, entertainment and sports venues can help stop the normalization of tobacco use.\t Kids should not be able to buy tobacco products online or from vending machines.  These options make it too easy for them to get around the federal law banning tobacco purchases before age 21.\t Images of tobacco use that kids can see in movies and media should be restricted.  Currently, adolescents see about 275 instances of tobacco use in PG-13            movies  every year. Reducing that to 10 or fewer exposures can reduce adolescent smoking by an estimated 18%.\t Youth prevention programs should not be in the hands of tobacco companies.  JUUL, a popular brand of e-cigarette, has promoted a curriculum that promised to support kids' health. But a 2018 study found the program failed to fully explain the health risks of e-cigarettes. Programs run by government agencies or non-profit advocacy groups are less likely to gloss over the harms of tobacco products, especially for kids.\t Teens should not work on tobacco farms or in tobacco-related industries.  Children and adolescents can suffer serious health effects when they breathe in            airborne toxins  or absorb them through the skin when            handling tobacco leaves . Parents are a powerful force in preventing youth tobacco use. Parents and caregivers are a child's first teachers. They are also the caring, involved grownups who make healthy choices for their families. You can support your child's health now and throughout a lifetime by: \t Keeping your home and car smoke-free  (including vape smoke) to protect your child from            secondhand and thirdhand smoke .\t Minimizing your own tobacco use or quitting altogether  with help from your physician, family, friends and            free programs  that can support you every step of the way. \t Talking to kids about tobacco use early,  which can help them put tobacco ads, images and social pressures in context and explore ways to say no. \t Join with other parents, educators and adults  to share ideas for encouraging young people to choose a tobacco-free lifestyle. \t Asking your pediatrician for support  whenever you're worried about tobacco and your child's health. Your child's doctor is ready to help you open positive conversions with your child about tobacco at every age and stage of their development.

This will be especially helpful for children, who have still-developing lungs and are easily harmed by smoke exposure.  See  Why are Smoke-free Environments a Big Deal?  for more information.   Fasts About Smoke-free Housing  Blood levels of cotinine, the typical marker of tobacco smoke exposure, are higher for children in non-smoking apartments than other non-smoking types of homes. This is most likely due to smoke from neighboring apartment units. Despite residential buildings that allow smoking being a fire hazard, health danger, and more expensive to insure, only about 4% of Public Housing Authorities in the US have voluntarily made its buildings smoke-free. Children exposed to tobacco smoke are at risk for asthma and other respiratory illnesses, earaches, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Some populations are more likely to become sick from smoke exposure such as children, the elderly, people with disabilities, or pregnant women. Some of these groups are also more likely to live in public housing buildings and can be easily exposed to smoke. ​The estimated cost of decontamination of a two-bedroom housing unit can be as much as $15,000. In July 2009, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development released a memo encouraging Public Housing Authorities to implement non-smoking policies in some or all of their public housing units. How far can tobacco smoke travel? Tobacco smoke can be measured in high quantities more than 20 feet from an outdoor source. According to a study published in a 2009 edition of Tobacco Control, 89% of low-income apartments with no smokers had detectable air nicotine concentrations.

This includes unborn babies and people who don't smoke.  If you smoke cigarettes, cigars, or pipes, or use     \t smokeless tobacco  like chew and snuff, quit! It's the best thing you can do for yourself and for everyone around you is quit.   Smoking Harms Infants and Children When parents expose their children to smoke, or let others do so, they are putting their children's health in danger and sending a message that smoking is OK.  \t Secondhand smoke  is the smoke a smoker breathes out. It's also the smoke that comes from the tip of lit cigarettes, pipes, and cigars. It contains about 4,000 different chemicals, many of which cause cancer. Because of exposure to secondhand smoke, about 3,400 nonsmokers die from lung cancer every year and 22,000 to 69,000 nonsmokers die from heart disease every year.  Breathing in smoke can cause: Asthma Respiratory infections (like bronchitis and pneumonia) Lung problems Ear infections Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (for babies younger than 1 year)\t The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that families keep \t   smoke-free homes and vehicles  at all times. This is the only way to fully prevent exposure to the toxic chemicals in secondhand smoke.  Smoking Harms Unborn Babies\t Smoking during pregnancy or exposing pregnant women to smoke  can lead to many serious health problems for an unborn baby, such as: Miscarriage Premature birth (born not fully developed) Lower birth weight than expected (possibly meaning a less healthy baby) SIDS Learning problems and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Smoking Harms Teens 90% of smokers start before age 18. About one-third of them will die of a smoking-related disease. Other     \t teen smokers  may experience the same health problems as adult smokers, including:   Addiction to nicotine Long-term cough Faster heart rate Lung problems Higher blood pressure Less stamina and endurance Higher risk of lung cancer and other cancers More respiratory infections Smoking also gives you bad breath, yellow teeth, and yellow fingernails; makes your hair and clothes smell bad; and wrinkles your skin.  \t For these reasons, the AAP recommends that the legal age to purchase tobacco products be raised to 21. By the time a person reaches age 21, it is unlikely that they will begin smoking. Communities who have raised the tobacco purchase age have seen decreases in teen smoking rates. Smoking Harms Adults Smoking is the most preventable cause of death in the United States.  Think about the following facts:  Every year in the United States about 438,000 people die from diseases related to smoking. According to the American Cancer Society, smoking kills more people than alcohol, car crashes, suicide, AIDS, murder, and drugs combined. Smoking causes 87% of lung cancer deaths. Lung cancer is the leading type of cancer in men and women. In addition to cancer, smoking also causes heart disease, stroke, chronic lung problems, and many other diseases. It's Time to Quit! Thousands of Americans have found a way to stop smoking. You can too. People who quit smoking live longer, healthier lives. They look and feel better. They save money and are great role models for others. Most importantly, they can help improve the health of their children and other family members.  Additional Information: \t   The Dangers of Secondhand Smoke\t Julius B.

        "content": "​​​​By: Carol Duh-Leong, MD, MPP Parents are usually thrilled when their children learn to share with each other—whether its toys when they're younger or the family car when they're teens.      One thing siblings shouldn't share is life-threatening habit like smoking or tobacco use.  A      study  published in      Pediatrics  showed teens in particular may be more likely to begin smoking if they have an older sibling or a sibling of the same gender that smokes. Teens' behaviors are shaped by the actions of people important to them. Regardless of normal sibling bickering growing up, a child's brother or sister also has an important influence on his or her decisions.  If your teen has siblings or other family members who smoke, take steps to help protect him or her from an addiction to nicotine in tobacco:\t Look in the mirror . As a parent, your smoking behavior has an enormous influence on your teen's behavior. It may not feel like it every day, but your teen looks up to you as a role model, and one of the best ways to prevent your teen from smoking is to model smoke-free behavior yourself. If you smoke,            quit . There are free resources including your state's quitline to help. \t Discuss smoking with your teen.  Teens value the opinions of their parents. Talk to your child about smoking-related issues in a constructive and respectful manner so both of you can express your feelings and opinions freely. This also opens the door to a relationship where your teen sees you as a person to talk to about difficult issues.\t Identify your teen's talents.  Smoking is more common among teens with lower grade-point averages and with lower self-esteem. Be very positive about their child's talents and goals—whether it be basketball, social studies, or tuba— so that he or she has a strong sense of identity outside of potentially unhealthy habits.\t Tell your children about the side effects of smoking.  Explain that smoking hurts athletic ability, causes early wrinkles, stinky breath, stained teeth, and costs a lot of money. Not to mention that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people who smoke            die at least a dozen years sooner  than nonsmokers on average. Teens concerned about the environment might also be interested to know that more than a billion and a half pounds of cigarette butts end up as toxic trash each year!\t Encourage the sibling to quit.  Talk to your teen's sibling about his or her role in influencing smoking habits in their sibling(s). Empower your son or daughter to be a positive role model for his or her siblings by quitting smoking. Ask their pediatrician for help to encourage and provide resources for him or her to quit. \t If your other child does start to smoke, encourage him or her to quit.  Nicotine addiction takes hold quickly—within days or weeks after starting to smoke. It isn't easy, but every attempt should be considered a success.\t Think \t   beyond cigarettes .  Smokeless tobacco, hookah, e-cigarettes, and cloves are increasingly popular among teens. All are addictive and can cause health problems. Parents have the power: \t Bottom Line —Kids who have a sibling who smoke are more likely to smoke. However, you can prevent smoking in your child by modeling smoke-free behavior, having open and honest discussions, and supporting or encouraging your other child to quit.

Secondhand smoke causes about 3,000 deaths from lung cancer and tens of thousands of deaths from     \t heart disease  to nonsmoking adults in the United States each year.  Millions of children are breathing in secondhand smoke in their own     \t homes . Secondhand smoke can be especially harmful to your children's health because their lungs still are developing. If you smoke around your children or they are exposed to secondhand smoke in other places, they may be in more danger than you realize. Children whose parents smoke only outside are still exposed to the chemicals in secondhand smoke. The best way to eliminate this exposure is to quit. \t Read more to learn about the dangers of ­secondhand smoke and how to create a smoke-free environment for your children.  What is Secondhand Smoke? Secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is the smoke a smoker breathes out and that comes from the tip of burning cigarettes, pipes, and cigars. It contains about 4,000 chemicals. Many of these chemicals are dangerous; more than 50 are known to cause cancer. Anytime children breathe in secondhand smoke they are exposed to these chemicals. \t The American Academy Pediatrics (AAP) has conducted research on the effects of thirdhand smoke and found that it is also harmful. Thirdhand smoke is the smoke left behind—the harmful toxins that remain in places where people have smoked previously. Thirdhand smoke can be found in the walls of a bar, upholstery on the seats of a car, or even a child's hair after a caregiver smokes near the child.  Your Developing Baby and Smoke If you smoke or are exposed to secondhand smoke when you're  pregnant , your baby is exposed to harmful chemicals too. This may lead to many serious health problems, including:  Miscarriage Premature birth (born not fully developed) Lower birth weight than expected (possibly meaning a less healthy baby) Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) Learning problems and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) The health risks go up the longer the pregnant woman smokes or is exposed to smoke. Quitting anytime during pregnancy helps—of course, the sooner the better. All pregnant women should stay away from secondhand smoke and ask smokers not to smoke around them.  Secondhand Smoke and Your Children's Health Infants have a higher risk of SIDS if they are exposed to secondhand smoke. Children have a higher risk of serious health problems, or problems may become worse. Children who breathe secondhand smoke can have more:  Ear infections Coughs and colds Respiratory problems, such as bronchitis and pneumonia Tooth decay Children of smokers cough and wheeze more and have a harder time getting over colds. They miss many more school days too. Secondhand smoke can cause other symptoms including stuffy nose, headache, sore throat, eye irritation, and hoarseness.  Children with asthma are especially sensitive to secondhand smoke. It may cause more asthma attacks and the attacks may be more severe, requiring trips to the hospital.  Long-Term Effects of Secondhand Smoke Children who grow up with parents who smoke are themselves more likely to smoke. Children and teens who smoke are affected by the same health problems that affect adults. Secondhand smoke may cause problems for children later in life including:  Poor lung development (meaning that their lungs never grow to their full potential) Lung cancer Heart disease Cataracts (an eye disease) Secondhand Smoke is Everywhere Children can be exposed to secondhand smoke in many places. Even if there are no smokers in your home, your children can still be exposed to secondhand smoke. Places include:  In a car or on a bus At child care or school At a babysitter's house At a friend's or relative's house In a restaurant At the mall At sporting events or concerts In parks or playgrounds Creating a Smoke-Free Environment The following tips may help keep your children from being exposed to secondhand smoke: \t Set the example . If you smoke, quit today! If your children see you smoking, they may want to try it, and they may grow up smoking as well. If there are cigarettes at home, children are more likely to experiment with smoking—the first step in becoming addicted.\t Remove your children from places where smoking is allowed, even if no one is smoking while you are ther e . Chemicals from smoke can be found on surfaces in rooms days after the smoking occurred.\t   Make your home smoke free . Until you can quit, don't smoke inside your home and don't smoke anywhere near your children, even if you are outside. Don't put out any ashtrays. Remember, air flows throughout a house, so smoking in even one room allows smoke to go everywhere. \t   Make your car smoke free . Until you can quit, don't smoke inside your car. Opening windows isn't enough to clear the air and can actually blow smoke back into the faces of passengers in the back seat.\t Choose a babysitter who doesn't smoke . Even if the babysitter smokes outside, your children are exposed. Consider changing babysitters to find a smoke-free environment for your children.\t Encourage tobacco-free child care and schools . Help your children's child care or school, including outdoor areas and teachers' lounges, become tobacco free. Get your children involved in the effort to make schools tobacco free! An Important Choice If you smoke, one of the most important things you can do for your own health and the health of your children is to     \t stop smoking . Quitting is the best way to prevent your children from being exposed to secondhand smoke.  It may be hard to quit. Talk with your doctor or your child's pediatrician if you need help. There are over-the-counter and prescription medicines that may help you quit. Call 1-800-QUIT-NOW to be connected to your state quitline- they can refer you to local resources and help you quit.  Parents need to make every effort to keep their children away from smokers and secondhand smoke. Parents who smoke should quit for their health and the health of their children.  Additional Information & Resources: Why are Smoke-free Environments a Big Deal?

After smoke has been in the air, it settles on surfaces in rooms throughout the building. This smoke can be ingested by children, making them sick with ear infections, bronchitis, pneumonia, or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The smoke can be inhaled by children, or ingested through putting items in their mouths. It is important to understand that opening a window, sitting in a separate area, or using ventilation, air conditioning, or a fan cannot eliminate secondhand smoke exposure. If you cannot quit smoking, it is important to maintain a smoke-free environment in areas where children live or play. Tips to Keep a Smoke-free Home: Never smoke inside your home, even when it's cold outside. Smoking indoors one time is enough to contaminate the rest of the house, even if you're in a room with the doors closed. Create a comfortable place to smoke outdoors for both yourself and any visitors who smoke. Keeping an umbrella near the door will help encourage you to go outside to smoke even when the weather is bad. Let guests know that your house is smoke free and show them to a child-free area where they can smoke if they need to do so. Consider posting a sign to remind visitors that there is no smoking in your house. Tips to Keep a Smoke-free Car: Do not smoke, ever, in a car that transports children. Smoking in your car even once can fill the seats and other materials with toxins, even if the windows are open. Remind passengers not to smoke in your car. Try to time your smoking to coincide with times when you know you will be without children at another location- Headed to work, where there is a designated smoking area? Try to hold off on smoking until you get there. You will keep your child healthier, as well as your car! Fill your car's ashtray with spare change so you aren't tempted to fill it with ash. Leave a cell phone charger or other device plugged into the car's adapter outlet so you are not tempted to use it as a lighter. Store your cigarettes in the trunk or in another out-of-reach area while you drive. Consider putting up a sticker or decal on your car that reminds passengers that it is a no smoking vehicle.\t   Remember that the only way to completely protect your family from the toxic chemicals in secondhand smoke is to \t \t \t quit smoking .

        "content": "By: Kamakshya Patra, MD, FAAP Staying clear of cigarettes and other tobacco products is one of the most important ways parents can help their children—especially those with asthma—breathe easy. Up in Smoke: Effects on the Lungs  Tobacco smoke contains nicotine and thousands of other chemicals, many with known health effects. Exposure to tobacco can cause lung problems even before a child's first breath. Research  shows tobacco and nicotine exposure—both in the womb and after a child is born—can:  Interfere with healthy lung development, which begins before birth and continues through about age 15. The effect is long-lasting, with evidence suggesting teens exposed to  secondhand smoke  perform worse on lung function tests. Cause more frequent sickness, because it is more difficult for a child's immune system to fight off respiratory infections. Trigger asthma flare-ups and  attacks , with wheezing, coughing, chest tightness and other breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the symptoms can be life-threatening.  Cause the best available  asthma-control medications  to not work as well.  Clear the Air Kids Breathe!  More than 40% of children who go to the emergency room for asthma live with smokers. For children who have asthma, however, the frequency and severity of asthma attacks improves greatly if smoke exposure stops.  Steps that can help children with asthma: Keep your home and car smoke-free. Opening a window doesn't protect against tobacco smoke. In addition, cigarette smoke and vapor can settle into upholstery, clothing, and carpeting. Children who play on or near contaminated surfaces may develop breathing problems. If your state allows smoking in public areas, seek out restaurants and other places that have their own no-smoking policies. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, non-smoking sections where people smoke nearby don't protect against secondhand smoke, even if they have filtered ventilation systems. Make sure your child care centers and schools have and enforce tobacco-free policies, with no smoking allowed anywhere in the building at any time. This includes off-campus school events. Teach children to avoid secondhand smoke and the importance of never starting the habit themselves. If you smoke, resolve to  quit . It is very difficult to be a smoker and not expose your child, and children of smokers are more likely to start smoking later.  Seek help for tobacco dependence if your child has asthma and you struggle to quit smoking. Nicotine is one of the most addictive drugs known and changes brain structure and chemistry. Some people can stop tobacco use without medication, but many cannot. The nicotine patch, nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenge are available over the counter. Bupropion (Wellbutrin, Zyban), varenicline (Chantix), nicotine nasal spray, and nicotine oral inhaler are available by prescription. Remember: When you quit smoking, or take other steps to avoid tobacco exposure, your child will not need as much asthma medicine. Quitting will help keep your child out of emergency room and hospital. Both of you will be able to breathe easier!

        "content": "If you're struggling to keep up with the different forms of tobacco and nicotine targeted at kids, don't feel bad. Most parents and caregivers are in the same boat, since manufacturers are introducing new products all the time. If a product is labeled \"tobacco-free,\" is it safe for young people? And what about newer alternatives like e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches that are wildly popular with Gen Z? Here's what adults need to know about tobacco, nicotine and children's health, plus a look at the flood of products tobacco companies hope kids will try. With or without smoke, nicotine is dangerous for your child\t Nicotine  is a natural chemical present in anything made with tobacco leaves. This covers a wide range of products, from cigarettes and cigars to \"smokeless\" alternatives like chew, dip and dissolvable tobacco. Nicotine can be made in the lab, too—which is why some vapes and nicotine pouches can be labeled \"tobacco-free.\" But ANY product that delivers nicotine will harm your child's health.  What else to know about nicotine:\t Nicotine is a \t    stimulant  that hits the human brain within 20 seconds, offering a dose of energy that may ease feelings of tension or stress. These pleasurable effects are just one reason that people who use it get hooked. In fact, research shows that nicotine is as likely to cause    substance use disorder  as heroin or cocaine.\t Nicotine changes the way our brains work.  This may explain why it's linked with    learning and attention problems , especially in young people. And since your child's    brain  will continue to grow and develop through age 25, the effects of nicotine can last a lifetime.\t It affects breathing and circulation . Nicotine causes blood vessels to narrow, limiting blood flow to vital organs. Over time, your child's blood vessels will become stiff and less flexible, limiting the flow of oxygen and nutrients to every cell in their body.\t Nicotine has been linked with \t   anxiety and depression  in young people—another harmful effect that may be fueling the surge in mental health concerns our kids are facing. Older forms of tobacco with new appeal for kids  Along with    cigarettes , many traditional forms of tobacco are seeing a resurgence in the U.S. Though    federal law  prohibits retail stores from selling tobacco products to anyone under 21, enforcement has been challenging. Young people may also buy them online.\t  Cigars, cigarillos and little cigars   Unlike cigarettes, these products are usually made from whole-leaf tobacco tightly rolled inside a tobacco wrapper. Cigars and cigarillos differ only in size; both lack a filter to reduce tar and other harmful chemicals that cigarette smokers take in. (Little cigars are the smallest of these products and do have a filter tip.) Because the nicotine content of cigar-style smokes is high—100 to 200 milligrams, as compared with 8 milligrams in a single cigarette—they put people who use them at high risk of substance use disorders. Smoking cigars of any size will raise your child's risks for lung, oral and throat cancer and serious respiratory issues like chronic bronchitis and emphysema.\t Hookah   This is a centuries-old way of smoking that uses a large glass pipe, often shared by multiple users in a hookah lounge or social gathering. Inside the pipe, tobacco is heated over a charcoal burner. Smoke enters a water-filled bowl that leads to a long, flexible tube with a mouthpiece. Other    names  used for hookah include water pipe, narghile, argileh, shisha, hubble-bubble and goza. Hookah tobacco often has real and artificial flavors (fruit, chocolate, mint and more). In a typical 1-hour session, people using hookah may inhale    100 to 200 times  the amount of smoke they would get from just one cigarette.\t Menthol-flavored products Menthol is a chemical found in peppermint and other mint plants, but it can be made in the lab, too. Cigarette companies have long used it to reduce the burning sensation caused by inhaling tobacco smoke. As a result, people who smoke may breathe in more deeply and hold smoke in their lungs longer, leading to higher health risks and increased risk of substance use disorder. Since the 1950s, tobacco companies have focused marketing campaigns on    specific groups , including Black people. As a result, more than 8 in 10 Black Americans who smoke use menthol cigarettes. The tobacco industry has also targeted Latino, Asian and LGBTQ+ people who smoke. Research shows that half of all kids age 12 to 17 who smoke old    prefer menthols .\t Kreteks  (clove cigarettes)  These unfiltered smokes are made with a blend of tobacco, cloves and other ingredients. Traditional in Indonesian countries but sold worldwide, clove cigarettes contain the same harmful chemicals as regular cigarettes, including nicotine. In fact, a 2021 review pointed to high levels of tar and carbon monoxide in kreteks, elevating users' risks for cancer, heart and lung issues and more.\t Bidis Also known as beedis or biris, these are cigarettes typically made in India with shredded tobacco, hand-rolled in a tendu leaf and tied with string. Studies conducted in India show high rates of chronic bronchitis and other respiratory problems among people who smoke bidis, along with lung cancer risks 5 to 6 times higher than nonsmokers. In the U.S., bidis are sold online and in local tobacco stores.\t Chewing tobacco   This classic form of smokeless tobacco comes in a can, pouch or twisted plug and may include candy-like flavors. Users place a small amount between the cheek and gum, drawing out the tobacco flavor and spitting any excess. Nicotine and other harmful chemicals are quickly absorbed through the mouth lining. Chew, as it's often called, is closely associated with mouth, throat and pancreatic cancer as well as heart disease, gum disease and tooth loss.\t Pinch or dip These are powdered or shredded forms of tobacco that, much like chew, are placed between the cheek and gum or inhaled through the nostrils. Research links dip and pinch with the same health risks seen with chew, including dental disease, heart and lung issues and cancer. Newer nicotine products that aren't safe for kids, despite what manufacturers say Newer tobacco and nicotine delivery systems continue to grow as manufacturers bring more products to market. \t E-cigarettes (or \"vapes\") When  e-cigarettes  first hit the U.S. market, many companies claimed they were a healthier alternative to cigarettes. Some ads even suggested that vaping could help people quit smoking or keep them from starting. But, just like cigarettes, these nicotine devices are highly addictive. The most popular e-cigarettes contain highly concentrated    nicotine salts  that deliver much more nicotine that traditional cigarettes. JUUL, once the most popular e-cigarette, contains    40 milligrams of nicotine  in a single pod—roughly the amount someone who smokes would get from a full pack of cigarettes. Newer, disposable vaping products such as Elf Bar contain as much nicotine as 590 cigarettes!\t Disposable e-cigarettes: more popular, more addictive? Disposable vapes were the    most common  type of e-cigarette used by U.S. young people in 2023. This has health experts concerned.   Teens and young adults using disposable e-cigarettes    report  more frequent and continued use of them, compared to peers using devices that must be recharged or refilled with nicotine liquid or pods. Disposable vapes come in various candy-like flavors, unlike non-disposable e-cigarettes that are more strictly    regulated .  Along with nicotine, kids who vape may also absorb toxic metals and    acrolein , a chemical known to cause liver damage.\t Snus This smokeless tobacco product comes in small pouches containing powdered tobacco that fit under the upper lip. Originally from Sweden, snus is now made in the U.S. by major tobacco companies. Young people may like snus because, unlike other smokeless products, it doesn't require spitting.  Snus are often promoted as a way to help people quit cigarettes. However, since it delivers nicotine and other cancer-causing agents, however, snus poses serious risks for substance use disorder, cancer and heart issues.\t Nicotine pouches   Marketed by a European company owned by tobacco giant Phillip Morris,    nicotine pouches  sold under the ZYN brand have captured wide attention in the U.S. This is thanks to social media \"ZYNfluencers\" who generated millions of views on TikTok alone. Unlike Swedish-style snus, nicotine pouches contain no leaf tobacco. Labeling these products as tobacco-free might make them seem healthier than other alternatives, but their nicotine content makes them addictive and harmful to growing bodies.\t Dissolvable tobacco  & non-tobacco nicotine products Of all smokeless products, this one may come closest to candy in its appeal to young users. Dissolvable tobacco comes in sticks, tablets, small pellets shaped like breath mints or lozenges or thin strips that melt in the mouth. There are even    Nicotine gummies  are also among the most popular    non-tobacco oral nicotine products  used by adolescents. These products come in tasty flavors and don't cause users to spit, so they can be used anywhere. Because they usually deliver more nicotine than cigarettes, children may eat too many, raising risks for    nicotine poisoning .  Nicotine chewing gum    Nicotine gum has long been available as a    tool to help quit smoking , but newer products are marketed for    nonmedical  purposes. Modern packaging can make it easy to conceal and also easily confused with regular gum, which could lead to unintentional nicotine poisoning.\t Heated tobacco products   These are also called \"heat-not-burn\" or \"smokeless\" tobacco products. Rather than liquid vape \"juice,\" brands such as IQOS use compressed ground tobacco heated by an electronic unit that generates an aerosol. They deliver about the same level of nicotine as cigarettes, so are just as addictive. Heated tobacco users also breathe in carbon monoxide, heavy metals such as arsenic, lead and mercury and other toxic chemicals. How to talk with your child about nicotine, tobacco and lifelong health The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has taken    a strong stand  against nicotine and tobacco use for kids. Our policies follow clear evidence that nicotine and tobacco in ANY form are bad for growing bodies and brains. Parents, guardians and other caring adults can make a real difference in helping kids adopt an informed perspective about tobacco and nicotine. Here are tips for opening a healthy conversation with your child:\t Know your facts.  Understanding why tobacco and nicotine are harmful will help you feel confident and prepared to answer any questions your child might have.\t Take a stand, but don't preach . Older kids are focused on building independence. This means they often reject a parent's point of view, especially if they feel judged or pressured to agree. A more effective way to talk to tweens and teens is to emphasize how much you love them. Any concern about tobacco and nicotine reflects your hope that they'll live a long, healthy life.\t Address your own tobacco or nicotine use.  If you use one or more of the products listed in this article, your child might wonder why they shouldn't try them too.    Quitting  can be tough, but it will set a positive example for your child. Even if you don't quit, you can be honest with your child: \"The truth is, I wish I had never started. I'm hoping you won't.\"\t Talk with your child's doctor.  Pediatricians and family physicians are ready to support you in keeping children away from tobacco and nicotine products. Hearing this message from many different adults, including doctors, can help kids develop healthy perspectives about smoking, vaping and other health issues.

        "content": "​​​Millions of people—adults and children—are exposed to  secondhand smoke​ . Sometimes, the smoke that poses a health threat comes from an adjacent housing unit such as another apartment or condominium unit. Smoke travels through walls, ventilation systems, and hallways, which expose non-smokers to the same health threats faced by smokers. Many towns, states, casinos, medical centers, campuses, and residential buildings are moving towards keeping all of their structures smoke free, in an effort to reduce the amount of people exposed to tobacco smoke. This is especially helpful for children, who have still-developing lungs and are easily harmed by smoke exposure. Fast Facts:  Blood levels of cotinine, the typical marker of tobacco smoke exposure, are higher for children in non-smoking apartments than other non-smoking types of homes. This is most likely due to smoke from neighboring apartment units. Children exposed to tobacco smoke are at  risk for asthma  and other respiratory illnesses,  earaches , and  sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) . Some populations are more likely to become sick from smoke exposure such as children, the elderly, people with disabilities, or pregnant women. Some of these groups are also more likely to live in public housing buildings and can be easily exposed to smoke. The estimated cost of decontamination of a two-bedroom housing unit can be as much as $15,000. How far can tobacco smoke travel? Tobacco smoke can be measured in high quantities more than 20 feet from an outdoor source. Despite marketing claims, no ventilation system can protect from the death and disease caused by exposure to secondhand smoke. Some organizations are taking smoke-free laws even further: tobacco-free laws are gaining traction. These policies include products like electronic nicotine delivery systems ( e-cigarettes ) and  smokeless tobacco  like dip or chew. Where We Stand:  The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy statement,  Tobacco Use: A Pediatric Disease , supports clean-air and smoke-free environment ordinances and legislation in communities and states—particularly for environments in which children live, learn, work, and play, such as schools, multi-unit housing, public parks, child care settings, public beaches, sidewalks, restaurants, and sporting arenas. These environments should be smoke free even when children are not present. To aid in accomplishing smoke-free environments, parents and caregivers can: Make your voice heard.  Work with your local and state legislators to support smoke-free environments. Keep a smoke-free home and car.  If quitting isn't possible, the only way to fully protect others from secondhand smoke is to  maintain smoke-free homes and vehicles . Educate your landlords and homeowners associations  about the importance of maintaining smoke-free multi-unit housing environments.

        "content": "​​​All children deserve high-quality medical care. As a parent, it is important to be aware of the most up-to-date treatment guidelines so you can be sure your child is getting the best care possible.  The following information from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) lists some of the most common childhood illnesses and their approved treatments. The treatments discussed here are based on scientific evidence and best practices. However, there may be reasons why your pediatrician has different recommendations for your child, especially if your child has an ongoing medical condition or allergy. Your pediatrician will discuss any variations in treatment with you. If you have any questions about appropriate care for your child, please discuss them with your pediatrician. 1.  Sore Throat Sore throats are common in children and can be painful . However, a sore throat that is caused by a virus does not need antibiotics. In those cases, no specific medicine is required, and your child should get better in seven to ten days. In other cases, a sore throat could be caused by an infection called streptococcal (strep throat).  Strep cannot be accurately diagnosed by simply looking at the throat . A lab test or in-office rapid strep test, which includes a quick swab of the throat, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of strep. If positive for strep, your pediatrician will prescribe an antibiotic. It's very important that your child take the antibiotic for the full course, as prescribed, even if the symptoms get better or go away. Steroid medicines (such as prednisone) are not an appropriate treatment for most cases of sore throat. Babies and toddlers rarely get it strep throat , but they are more likely to become infected by streptococcus bacteria if they are in child care or if an older sibling has the illness. Although strep spreads mainly through coughs and sneezes, your child can also get it by touching a toy that an infected child has played with.  See  The Difference between a Sore Throat, Strep & Tonsillitis  and  When a Sore Throat is a More Serious Infection .   2.  Ear Pain Ear pain is common in children and can have many causes —including ear infection (otitis media), swimmer's ear (infection of the skin in the ear canal), pressure from a cold or sinus infection, teeth pain radiating up the jaw to the ear, and others. . To tell the difference, your pediatrician will need to examine your child's ear. In fact, an in-office exam is still the best way for your pediatrician to make an accurate diagnosis. If your child's ear pain is accompanied by a high fever, involves both ears, or if your child has other signs of illness, your pediatrician may decide that an antibiotic is the best treatment.  Amoxicillin is the preferred antibiotic for middle ear infections —except when there is an allergy to penicillin or chronic or recurrent infections.  Many true ear infections are caused by viruses and do not require antibiotics . If your pediatrician suspects your child's ear infection may be from a virus, he or she will talk with you about the best ways to help relieve your child's ear pain until the virus runs its course.  See  Ear Infection Information ,  Middle Ear Infections , and  Your Child and Ear Infections .   3.  Urinary Tract Infection  Bladder infections, also called urinary tract infections or UTIs, occur when ­bacteria build up in the urinary tract . A UTI can be found in children from infancy through the teen years and into adulthood. Symptoms of a UTI include pain or burning during urination, the need to urinate frequently or urgently, bedwetting or accidents by a child who knows to use the toilet, abdominal pain, or side or back pain. Your child's doctor will need a urine sample to test for a UTI before determining treatment . Your doctor may adjust the treatment depending on which bacteria is found in your child's urine.  See  Detecting Urinary Tract Infections .   4.  Skin Infection In most children with skin infections, a skin test (culture or swab) may be needed to determine the most-appropriate treatment . Tell your doctor if your child has a history of MRSA, staph infection, or other resistant bacteria or if he or she has been exposed to other family members or contacts with resistant bacteria.  See  Boils, Abscess & Cellulitis  and  Tips for Treating Viruses, Fungi & Parasites .   5.  Bronchitis Chronic bronchitis is an infection of the larger, more central airways in the lungs and is more often seen in adults . Often the word \"bronchitis\" is used to describe a chest virus and does not require antibiotics. See  Bronchitis  (CDC.gov).   6.  Bronchiolitis Bronchiolitis is common in infants and young children during the cold and flu season . Your doctor may hear \"wheezing\" when your child breathes. Bronchiolitis is most often caused by a virus, which does not require antibiotics . Instead, most treatment recommendations are geared toward making your child comfortable with close monitoring for any difficulty in breathing, eating, or signs of dehydration. Medicines used for patients with asthma (such as albuterol or steroids) are not recommended for most infants and young children with bronchiolitis. Children who were born prematurely or have underlying health problems may need different treatment plans.  See  Bronchiolitis  and  Treating Bronchiolitis in Infants .   7.  Pain  The best medicines for pain relief for children are acetaminophen or ibuprofen . Talk to your pediatrician about how much to give your child, as it should be based on your child's weight.  Narcotic pain medications are not appropriate for children with common injuries or complaints such as sprained ankle, ear pain, or sore throats . Codeine should never be used for children as it's been associated with severe respiratory problems and even death in children. See  Fever and Pain Medicine: How Much To Give Your Child . 8.  Common Cold Colds are caused by viruses in the upper respiratory tract . Many young children—especially those in child care—can get 6 to 8 colds per year. Symptoms of a cold (including runny nose, congestion, and cough) may last for up to ten days.   Green mucus in the nose does not automatically mean that antibiotics are needed; common colds never need antibiotics.  However, if a sinus infection is suspected, your doctor will carefully decide whether antibiotics are the best choice based on your child's symptoms and a physical exam. See  Children and Colds  and  Caring for Your Child's Cold or Flu . 9.  Bacterial Sinusitis Bacterial sinusitis is caused by bacteria trapped in the sinuses.  Sinusitis is suspected when cold-like symptoms such as nasal discharge, daytime cough, or both last over ten days without improvement.  Antibiotics may be needed  if this condition is accompanied by thick yellow nasal discharge and a fever for at least 3 or 4 days in a row.   See  The Difference Between Sinusitis and a Cold .   10.  Cough  Coughs are usually caused by viruses and do not often require antibiotics .  Cough medicine is not recommended for children 4 years of age and younger, or for children 4 to 6 years of age unless advised by your doctor . Studies have consistently shown that cough medicines do not work in the 4-years-and-younger age group and have the potential for serious side effects. Cough medicines with narcotics—such as codeine—should not be used in children.  See  Coughs and Colds: Medicines or Home Remedies? . If Symptoms Change: Occasionally, mild infections—viral or bacterial—can develop into more serious infections.  Call your pediatrician if your child's illness appears to change, becomes worse, does not go away after a few days, or if you are worried about any new symptoms that develop. If your child's illness has worsened, or if he or she develops complications, your pediatrician may recommend a new treatment.  Have More Questions?  If you have any questions or concerns about appropriate care for your child, please discuss them with your pediatrician. While it may be tempting to go to a nearby after-hours clinic if your child is ill, your pediatrician knows your child best, has your child's medical records, and is the best place to start for advice. Ask your pediatrician how he or she would like to be contact when the office is closed.   In fact, the AAP does not recommend retail-based clinics, telehealth services outside of the medical home, or acute care services without pediatric expertise for children younger than 2 years.  See  Urgent Care: Is It Worth the No Wait?  for more information.

        "content": "​Anytime a child undergoes a surgical procedure requiring anesthesia or sedation, parents will have questions about possible risks—especially when that child is an infant or a toddler. In an effort to help families prepare, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) answers frequently asked questions about the safety of anesthesia.  Q: Is anesthesia safe for my baby? A:  Anesthesia and sedation are safer than they have ever been.  Pediatric anesthesiologi​sts​  have made it possible for millions of children—even the sickest babies—to undergo lifesaving surgeries and life-enhancing procedures. Like any medicine, anesthetics have associated risks for every person—young and old. Scientists and physicians continue to look at the safety and side effects of all medicines that are used in infants and children.  Q: When infants or young children need surgery, does anesthesia affect their developing brains?  A:  Scientists have been investigating the effects of anesthetics on the developing brain of animals for over 20 years. While animals who have long or repeated anesthesia may have problems with learning and behavior later in life, a single carefully administered anesthetic has not been found to be associated with these problems in children.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS) started an initiative called  SmartTots  (Strategies for Mitigating Anesthesia-Related neuroToxicity in Tots) to coordinate and fund research intended to make surgery, anesthesia, and sedation safer for infants and young children under age 4—a period of significant brain development. This research will help determine if any particular anesthetic or sedative drugs pose hazards to young children, design the safest anesthetic and sedative regimes, and potentially foster the development of new anesthetic and sedative drugs.  Over the past few decades, pediatric anesthesiologists have come a long way in ensuring the safety of young children under general anesthesia. There is much more to understand about the risks, and intensive research into all safety aspects of general anesthesia is ongoing now. Q: What should I do if my baby requires surgery? A:  Parents should discuss all of the risks and benefits of their child's surgery or procedure with his or her pediatric specialists.  Ask about timing.  If there is no risk associated with waiting to get the surgery (i.e., not life threatening or an emergency), then consider putting it off until your child is older than 3—research suggests that the effects of anesthesia on the brain decrease with age.  Talk to your anesthesiologist . If your hospital allows you to have a say in choosing an anesthesiologist, request the one who works on children the most frequently. Pediatric anesthesiologists are trained to use the least harmful medications to avoid problems and to tailor the amount of anesthetics given to the child based on his or her age, weight, gender, other medications being taken or specific illnesses.  Recognize that current anesthetics and/or sedatives are necessary for infants and children who require surgery or other painful and stressful procedures. Q: How will the pediatric anesthesiologist keep my child safe? A:  Specially trained pediatric anesthesiologists will carefully administer medications to help your child go to sleep and stay safe and comfortable. Children react to anesthesia differently than adults. The pediatric anesthesiologist will monitor your child's heart rate, blood pressure, breathing and oxygen levels, and adjust medications as needed. He or she will do whatever is needed to keep your child's vital signs stable and free of pain. Q: Are there any alternatives to general anesthesia for surgery?  A:  In young children, the safest way to perform most surgeries is under general anesthesia. The medications used for  sedation  have the same side effects as general anesthetics and vary depending on a child's age, weight, developmental level, health history, physical exam, and the type of test being performed. For example,  light sedation  is not often appropriate or possible for infants and young children.   Q: Are any medications used for sedation or anesthesia safer than others? A:  All medications used for sedation or anesthesia have been shown to affect normal brain development in animals when given repeatedly or for long periods of time. Certain types of anesthetics, such as opioids, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine, may not have these same cognitive effects in animals. While these alternative anesthetics are promising, they're not appropriate for all patients or procedures. Fortunately, researchers are working hard to find new medication options.  Q: My 2-year-old requires an MRI scan. Can he have this done without any anesthesia? A:  Most young children cannot remain still for an MRI scan and require general anesthesia to help them relax or sleep during the procedure. Several factors are considered when determining if a child will need general anesthesia, including: The age and developmental level of child—Infants and toddlers generally will not understand why they are having the MRI.  The length of time it takes to do the procedure—It can be 1-2 hours.  The amount of discomfort expected during the procedure—It is quite noisy and the child is moved into a narrow pipe and must remain motionless. Q: My newborn has an intestinal blockage, and her doctors say she needs surgery. Will the anesthesia hurt her brain? A:  This surgery is considered an emergency. Waiting can lead to  many  more complications and can threaten the life of your child. Pediatric anesthesiologists are trained to provide the safest and most effective anesthesia possible for your baby. Young children rarely have an operation unless there's a serious medical problem that can't wait.  Q: My 1-year-old needs ear tubes for repeated ear infections. Should I wait until he is older to get this done? A:  Follow the advice of your  pediatric otolaryngologist  (ENT). Chronic ear infections can cause problems with hearing and speech, so it is important that they get treated properly. These procedures are short and associated with very little exposure to anesthesia. A single short anesthetic is not associated with any developmental problems.  See  Language Delays in Toddlers: Information for Parents  for more information . Q: My 18-month-old has a large cut on her face, and the pediatric surgeon wants to sew it up in the operating room. Is it safer to get a little sedation in the emergency department or anesthesia in the operating room? A:  A complex cut on the face will take a long time to repair well, and it will require your child to be very still. General anesthesia in the operating room is a better and safer option than trying to sedate your child in the emergency department.  See  Cuts, Scrapes & Scar Management: Parent FAQs  for more information.  No sedative medications have been shown to be safer than any others. All the medications used in the emergency department to sedate your child have shown to lead to memory and learning problems in animals. Have more questions?  If you have other questions, please contact your local children's hospital and ask to talk to a pediatric anesthesiologist.

        "content": "Any time a child requires a hospital visit, it can cause anxiety for both a parent and the child. This especially may be the case when the visit involves any type of procedure that might require anesthesia. Examples of such procedures are surgery,  medical imaging , and certain tests to examine the stomach or intestines.  What is anesthesia? Anesthesia is medicine that allows surgery, a medical test, or medical treatment to be done without pain, memory, or movement. Anesthesia will temporarily put your child to sleep. The type of anesthesia given will depend on your child's health and special needs, as well as the procedure.   Your child's comfort and safety are very important. Before, during, and after anesthesia, your child's heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, temperature, and oxygen level in the blood are watched. Your child will remain \"asleep\" until the anesthesiologist takes away the medicine.   Most anesthesia professionals work as a team. Anesthesiologists (doctors), residents (doctors in training), certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), physician's assistants, and nurses may all be part of this team.  What is a pediatric anesthesiologist? A  pediatric anesthesiologist  is a doctor who has the experience and training to help ensure a successful surgery, test, or treatment for your child.  A pediatric anesthesiologist is a fully trained anesthesiologist who has completed at least one extra year of specialized training in anesthesia for infants and children. Many children who need surgery have complex medical problems that affect many parts of the body. The pediatric anesthesiologist has special training and experience to evaluate these complex problems and to plan a safe anesthetic for each individual child.  What will my child's doctor need to know before anesthesia is given? Before having anesthesia, your child will need a physical examination. At this time, either your child's doctor or a member of the anesthesia care team will review  your child's current health and medical history .   Be ready to answer questions about your child's health. This may take place right before or on the day of the surgery, test, or treatment.   It is important to tell the doctor about any of the following that apply to your child:  Allergies, including allergies to food, drugs, or latex (rubber). All medicines your child is taking. Remember to tell your child's doctor about herbal or natural and inhaled (breathed-in) medicines. Breathing problems, including asthma, croup, or wheezing. Also, snoring or apnea (periods when breath is held during sleep). Recent illnesses, especially bad colds or fevers. Problems your child had as a newborn, such as preterm birth, breathing problems such as croup or asthma, staying in a neonatal intensive care unit, or birth defects. Heart problems, including holes between the heart chambers. Also, valve problems, heart murmurs, or irregular heartbeats. Other medical problems your child has or has had, especially if they required a doctor visit or hospital stay. Use of anesthesia for a past surgery or procedure. Past problems with anesthesia or surgery, such as airway problems or problems going to sleep or waking up from anesthesia. Also, problems with nausea and vomiting after surgery. Family history  (both sides of the family) of problems with anesthesia. Family history of bleeding problems. Anyone in the home who smokes. If your child has loose teeth. (Sometimes loose teeth must be removed during anesthesia for your child's safety.) If your child may be pregnant. Your child may need blood tests prior to anesthesia. Other tests, such as x-rays, are also needed sometimes. Most of the time few tests, if any, are required.  What are the risks of anesthesia for my child? Anesthesia is very safe, but there are always risks to any medicine. Minor side effects of anesthesia, such as a sore throat, nausea, and vomiting, can be common. Major complications from anesthesia are rare. If you have concerns, ask your anesthesiologist.  What do I tell my child about anesthesia? Children who understand what is happening will have a more positive hospital experience. It is important to be honest with your child. However, keep in mind your child's age and level of maturity. Use words your child can understand such as sore for pain or taking a nap for being put under anesthesia.   Talk about the hospital visit 5 to 6 days ahead for older children and 2 or 3 days ahead for toddlers. Children 3 to 12 years of age may not be ready to hear about the risks of surgery or anesthesia. Often they understand enough to be scared but not enough to be reassured. Your anesthesiologist may wish to tell you about the risks when your child is not present.  If your child becomes worried when you talk about what anesthesia will be like, explain that it is OK to be scared. Point out that the anesthesia care team will work hard to make her feel safe and comfortable and will be with her the whole time. You can help keep your child's fears to a minimum by being calm and reassuring yourself.  Some hospitals offer special programs that explain the anesthesia and surgery process to children and families. Ask for printed and online resources that can help your child and you prepare.  What if my child gets sick just before the scheduled time? Call your anesthesia care team and your child's doctor if your child becomes ill near the time scheduled for the procedure.   If your child develops a cold or other illness, the surgery, test, or treatment may have to be rescheduled because the risk of problems may increase. If your child is exposed to  chickenpox  within 3 weeks of the procedure, it may be rescheduled because of the risk to other patients. Your child may be able to spread chickenpox before skin spots develop. Additional Information:  What is a Pediatric Anesthesiologist?

        "content": "The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) answers questions from parents about preparing for  anesthesia .  Can my child eat, drink, or take medicine on the day of anesthesia? Except for emergencies, your child's stomach should be empty when anesthesia is started. This helps prevent vomiting, which may cause food or stomach acid to get into the lungs. Prior to your child's anesthesia, it is important to check with your surgeon or  anesthesiologist  about specific guidelines for your child. Here are general recommendations.  Infants younger than 1 year of age may have:  Solid food until 8 hours before anesthesia. Keep in mind that baby food and  cereal  are solid foods. Infant formula  until 6 hours before anesthesia. Breast milk  until 4 hours before anesthesia. Clear liquids until 2 hours before anesthesia. Children of all ages may have: Solid food until 8 hours before anesthesia. Keep in mind that baby food and cereal are solid foods. In general, no solid foods are allowed after a certain time on the evening before anesthesia. Clear liquids until 2 hours before anesthesia. Clear liquids include apple  juice , clear soda, Popsicles, or a prepared electrolyte solution. Keep in mind that milk and baby formula are not clear liquids. Each health care facility has its own specific guidelines for eating and drinking prior to anesthesia. If you do not follow your health care facility's guidelines, your child's procedure may be delayed, cancelled, or rescheduled.  Also, ask your anesthesiologist which, if any, of your child's routine medicines may be taken on the day of anesthesia. Some types of medicines must be stopped prior to anesthesia. Almost all approved medicines should be given on the morning of anesthesia with small sips of water but not mixed with solids such as applesauce. Remember to tell the doctor about  herbal and natural types of medicines .   Important reminders On the morning your child receives anesthesia:  Be sure to follow the fasting (not eating) instructions. Dress your child in loose-fitting, comfortable clothes. Give your child routine morning medicines unless instructed not to. Bring a favorite comfort object, such as a blanket, stuffed animal, or toy. Be a calm and reassuring parent for your child. What will my child do while waiting for anesthesia? Most large hospitals have a special waiting area for children. If you have not done so already, you will meet the anesthesia care team at this time. They will review your child's records, briefly examine your child, tell you how they will keep your child safe, discuss the risks, and answer remaining questions or concerns.  What if my child is worried? A calm and supportive family can provide the most help in ensuring that your child will not be overly worried or upset. If your child has a special blanket, stuffed animal, or toy, remember to bring it.  Sedatives (medicines to help your child relax) may be given before the start of anesthesia to help reduce fear and worry in children. The choice of whether or not to give a sedative will depend on your child's age, level of anxiety, and medical condition, as well as your hospital's practices. Sedatives may be given through the mouth, through the nose, or as an injection.  If a sedative is given, you will need to watch your child carefully. Your child can get very sleepy and may need help sitting up or walking.  How will anesthesia be given to my child? Most children can choose one of the following ways for anesthesia to be started:  By breathing anesthetic gases through a mask. No pain is involved, but not all children will like having a mask placed on the face. Through a needle put into a vein (IV). If an IV is used, local anesthetic (numbing medicine) at the IV site may be used and can make this less painful. Through a needle put into a muscle (an injection). A shot may be necessary if your child is not able to remain still. A shot may be scary to a child, but it is quick and the pain is brief. Before the day of the surgery, test, or treatment, talk with your child about maybe using a mask. Explain that the mask contains special air that helps children feel sleepy. The mask may be treated with a special smell to make it more comfortable. This method may not be used in certain cases, such as for some emergencies, in the case of stomach or bowel problems, or if your child has eaten recently.  For older children, anesthesia is usually started by an IV. No matter how anesthesia is started, your child will be kept comfortable and asleep with gas and IV anesthetics. Your child will stay asleep during the surgery, test, or treatment and will be woken up once the procedure is finished. If your child needs to remain asleep after the procedure, your anesthesiologist will explain this to you.  Can I be with my child when anesthesia is started? Some hospitals allow 1 support person (usually a parent) to go with a child into the operating room or other area where the child is to receive anesthesia. This may be possible for scheduled procedures or surgeries but not for emergency surgery. Check on the policy at your hospital ahead of time. Your child's anesthesiologist will make the final decision. Remember, if you stay with your child when anesthesia is given, the purpose of being there is to support your child and ease her fears. Do this for the child, not for yourself.  If you are able to be present for the start of anesthesia, ask the anesthesiologist beforehand what you should expect to see and how your child might react. Understanding what is to happen will make you feel more comfortable, as watching your child undergo anesthesia can be difficult.  It is important to realize that even if you are allowed to be with your child for the start of anesthesia, your child may still get upset before going to sleep. This depends on your child's age, temperament, and past experiences.  Many anesthesiologists feel that giving children sedatives makes separation much easier and that parents do not need to be present. Many factors are involved in this decision. Whatever the decision, remember that the anesthesia care team has a lot of experience with helping children stay calm during these moments.   Where will my child go after the procedure? Your child will go to a recovery room or an intensive care unit, depending on the type of surgery, test, or treatment, as well as your child's medical condition. Usually, parents are allowed to be with their child in these areas if their child's condition is stable. After a routine procedure, the recovery stay is usually 30 minutes to 2 hours. Then your child may go to a regular hospital bed or a short-stay unit or be discharged home.   How will my child behave after the procedure? Children awaken from anesthesia in different ways, and every time may be difficult. Some are alert and calm right away. Others may remain groggy for a longer period. Infants and toddlers may be irritable until the effects of the anesthesia have worn off. If this is the case, your child may need more sedative medicine while sleeping off the remaining effects of anesthesia.  Will my child feel pain?  One of the main goals of anesthesia is to prevent pain during and after the procedure. If your child is in pain in the recovery room, pain medicine may be needed. Pain medicine comes in many different forms and can be given in many different ways. Your child's doctors will discuss the options with you and your child ahead of time.  Will nausea and vomiting be a problem?  Nausea and vomiting are common after anesthesia and may result from your child's condition, the procedure, or the side effects of anesthesia. If your child is vomiting a lot, your child may need to stay in the hospital longer. Sometimes an unplanned overnight stay in the hospital is needed. There are medicines that can be given to your child during or after anesthesia to reduce the chance that this will be a problem.  Discuss your questions or concerns with your anesthesia care team and your child's doctor or other doctor(s) who are involved. These health care professionals are trained to provide your child with comfort and safety throughout the process.  Be sure to keep your anesthesia care team informed about your child's health just before the procedure. Call the team or your child's surgeon if your child develops a cold or other illness or has been exposed to chickenpox within 3 weeks of the procedure.  Additional Information:  Anesthesia and Children: Information for Parents What is a Pediatric Anesthesiologist?

        "content": "Because of illness or injury, some children need to receive transfusions of blood and blood products. This procedure may be frightening for parents and their children. Many parents are also concerned about the safety of transfusions. While blood supply in the United States is considered very safe, parents should know a few things about blood transfusions and the safety of blood products for children.  Who Needs Blood Transfusions? One out of every 10 people admitted to a hospital needs a blood transfusion. A blood transfusion occurs when a patient receives a blood product (either red cells, platelets, or plasma) from another person (a donor).   Many types of patients may require blood transfusions. They include those:  With severe  anemia With severe injuries such as those from a car crash With severe burns With  cancer Who have undergone an organ or stem cell transplant Who have had heart surgery With hemoglobin disorders (eg,  sickle cell disease , thalassemia) Whose platelets do not work well With life-threatening infections and few white blood cells Whose  bone marrow  does not work well Are Blood Transfusions Safe? Stories in the news of people becoming infected with various diseases from contaminated blood may lead parents to fear and question the safety of blood transfusions. While cases of patients receiving contaminated blood have been documented, the risk of receiving such blood is actually very low. In the United States, all blood donors are volunteers who are carefully questioned about their health history, sexual practice, travel, and drug use. The blood products they donate are carefully checked for a wide variety of infections that could be spread through transfusions.  Some of the infections tested for include: Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),  the virus that causes  acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), a virus associated with a rare form of leukemia Syphilis West Nile virus Other infectious agents—including malaria, babesiosis, Dengue virus, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease—cannot be directly tested for but are instead screened for through donor history. If a donor is considered to be at significant risk for having a transmissible infection, the donor is not accepted. If a unit of blood is found to be unsafe, it is destroyed. The donor is then contacted and not allowed to donate blood in the future.  However, the most common reactions to blood transfusions are allergic (ie, itching, hives, or—in its more severe form—trouble breathing or wheezing). For that reason, transfusion should occur only under a doctor's supervision and in a location where medical help is immediately available. This reaction occurs during or very soon after the transfusion. Be sure to tell your child's doctor or nurse if your child starts to get uncomfortable, complains of itching, or develops hives or trouble breathing during or very soon after a transfusion. These events can be treated with medicines by mouth or by vein through an IV tube. If they occur often, the medicines can be given before the transfusion to prevent or decrease frequency of allergic reactions.  What You Should Know Before Giving Consent All medical procedures have risks. As mentioned, the risks of receiving blood or blood products may include disease transmission and allergic reactions. Before your child receives a transfusion of blood or blood products, you will be asked to give your permission or consent. To do this, you need to have as much information as possible.  Ask as many questions as you need, and make sure you understand:  Your child's condition and why a transfusion is needed Other treatments besides a transfusion, as well as their risks and benefits What will happen if you choose to refuse the transfusion Also, keep in mind that in an emergency, you may have no time to discuss why your child needs a transfusion. The doctor who is treating your child may also not be able to predict all possible risks and cannot give you any guarantees.  Where Can the Blood Come From? If your child needs a blood transfusion, you may be able to choose where the blood comes from.  How are Transfusions Done? If your child is old enough to understand, try to explain the procedure by going over what will happen.  Before the transfusion begins, a small amount of your child's blood will be tested to identify its type and to make sure it matches the donor. This is done by inserting a needle into a vein in your child's arm (this should only sting for a few seconds) and withdrawing the blood into a test tube to be used by the laboratory. Next, a sterile, single-use plastic tube (catheter) or needle (butterfly) will be placed into a vein in your child's arm and taped in place. The nurse will make sure the blood that is used is the correct blood for your child. You may be asked to identify your child. A bag holding the blood or blood product will then be hung on a pole next to your child's hospital bed. Finally, a plastic tube will be attached from the bag to the tube or needle in your child's arm. The transfusion begins when the contents of the bag start to flow. Once the transfusion begins, your child should not feel any pain. If your child complains of pain or a burning sensation, becomes itchy, or feels anxious, let the nurse know. Because the blood has been refrigerated, your child may feel cold after a few minutes. Ask the nurse for a blanket if your child gets uncomfortably cold.  Most transfusions take 2 to 4 hours. However, if your child requires more than 1 unit of blood or requires another blood product, the transfusion could last longer. When the transfusion is over, the nurse will remove the tube or needle from your child's arm and cover the vein with a bandage.  Remember If your child needs to receive blood or blood products, talk with your child's doctor about any concerns or fears you have about the procedure.  If necessary, seek out a specialist in transfusion medicine (usually a clinical pathologist affiliated with a hospital blood bank) or hematologist (medical blood specialist). Learn all you can about your child's condition, and make sure you understand the benefits and risks of receiving blood or blood products.  Additional Information:  Anemia and Your Child   Sickle Cell Disease in Children ​",

        "content": "By: Kathi Kemper, MD, MPH, FAAP Aromas hit the nose and go directly to the most primitive parts of the brain, affecting our emotions and nervous system before our higher cortex is even aware of them. Familiar smells such as morning coffee, pumpkin pie baking, grandmother's lavender-scented pillowcases – these are all comforting and reassuring. Retail stores use aroma to entice shoppers to feel comfortable and shop longer. Harsh smells of hospital disinfectants can conjure up fear. The perfume industry invests millions of dollars designing new combinations of alluring fragrances. Essential oils for aromatherapy Many massage therapists include essential oils in their massage lotions to combine the benefits of aromatherapy and massage. Hospitals, hospices and clinics around the world are starting to use aromas to help patients feel more relaxed, cheerful, and at ease. The essential oils of lavender, clary sage, neroli, and chamomile are relaxing, reducing agitation and stress and promoting calm. The plant oils from citrus, pine, eucalyptus, cedar, and mint promote alertness, focus, and a feeling of being refreshed. Be careful with essential oils of plants, though. Even though they are natural, they are strong and some people develop skin irritation if the pure, undiluted oils are applied directly to the skin. Natural and chemical fragrances & scents Be aware as you shop for home cleaning products, laundry cleaning products, soaps, personal hygiene products and air fresheners. Some of these products contain natural fragrances from the essential oils of plants, while others are based on new-to-nature chemical imposters that can trigger nasty reactions. For people who are extremely sensitive to chemical odors, chemical smells trigger headaches, depression, anxiety, mood swings, irritability, fatigue, and a variety of other unpleasant symptoms. The medical name for this is multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS); people with MCS can experience full-blown panic attacks, confusion, or deep depression when confronted with chemicals to which they are sensitive. Whenever possible, use natural cleaners such as vinegar and baking soda, citrus oils, geranium, rose or lavender.

        "content": "​​​When they need them—and when they don't A blow to the head can be scary. But usually it is not very serious. Often there is just a mild  concussion , with no serious injuries like bleeding or cracks to the skull. After a  head injury , the doctor may order a test called a CT scan (pronounced \"cat\" scan).  A CT scan takes many X-rays, to create a 3D picture of the brain.  But your child may not need a CT scan for a minor head injury. Here's why:   Often, CT scans aren't necessary.  About half of children in emergency rooms with head injuries get CT scans. But one in three of the CT scans aren't necessary. Before ordering a CT scan, the doctor should examine the child and ask about the injury and symptoms. If your doctor thinks your child has a mild concussion, a CT scan will probably not be helpful— the CT scan results are usually normal. CT scans are better for other kinds of injuries, such as skull fractures or bleeding in the brain. A concussion is not caused by bleeding in the brain.  CT scans have risks.  CT scans use radiation, which can increase the risk of cancer. Children, and especially infants, have greater risks because their brains are still developing. And unnecessary CT scans can lead to more tests and treatments, with more risks. CT scans are expensive.  CT scans of the brain can cost between $500 and $900. Costs vary widely. It's okay to ask if the scan is really needed before spending the money.  When to see a doctor.  Go to the doctor right away if your child becomes unconscious, has a headache that won't stop, or is dizzy, confused, or nauseous. These symptoms may happen hours or days later. When to get a CT scan of the brain. A doctor should order a CT scan if it is likely that the child has a skull fracture or bleeding. The doctor should ask about the accident and symptoms listed below. The doctor should also examine the child for signs of skull fracture, such as black eyes and bleeding. The accidents listed below are more likely to cause serious head injuries:  A motor vehicle accident Falling from three or more feet off the ground  Falling down five or more stairs  Falling off a bicycle without a helmet  The symptoms listed below may be signs of serious injury: Becoming unconscious  Tingling on one side of the body  Being dizzy or losing balance  Loss of vision or hearing  A headache that gets worse  Being very sleepy or irritable  What to expect if a CT scan is needed.  The CT scan should happen soon. The child may need immediate treatment.  The doctor will use the lowest dose of radiation.  The scan will include only the head (unless there may be a neck or spine injury).  Repeated scans will be avoided.​ Editor's Note:  The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released a list of specific tests or treatments that are commonly given to children, but are not always necessary, as part of the Choosing Wisely® campaign, an initiative of the ABIM Foundation.

        "content": "By: Richard Chung, MD, FAAP I'm the father of two boys—13 and 8—and an adolescent medicine specialist at Duke Health in North Carolina. I'd like to share my thoughts about the COVID-19 pandemic, and safe and effective    vaccines  to protect children and teens, from my perspective as a pediatrician and a parent.  As the coronavirus spread across the country, I became increasingly alarmed.  In December 2020,    pediatric clinical trials  got underway for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. I work closely with some of the researchers leading the effort at Duke, where I have seen patients, taught medical students and conducted research for 10 years.  Initial data on the safety and effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in adults was really positive. Meanwhile, infections were surging. We, pediatricians, all felt a strong desire to find a vaccine to prevent the spread.  My son Caleb was 12 at the time and qualified to enroll in a pediatric clinical trial. I talked with Caleb and my wife, and Caleb was interested in participating. He had never been a research participant before, but once we figured out all the details of what would be involved and discussed the potential benefits and the risks of any research, he quickly was on board. Our younger son, Joshua, who is 8, so admired his brother's contribution that he himself volunteered to participate in the vaccine trial for 5-11 year olds.   Kids helping other kids This trial couldn't have happened without the kids. Testing a vaccine for children is not something adults can do. That's the beautiful aspect of this: Kids volunteered to do something to help other kids. This is a great example of how young people have helped society.\t   I wanted to fight back against the pandemic By Caleb Chung  It was a great opportunity that I was able to participate in a vaccine clinical trial, especially since I had just turned 12 and barely made it into the group to qualify.  It was a new experience because I had never been in a research study before. I didn't know how it was going to play out. It was, like, a lot to think about.  But I decided to participate because I wanted to fight back against the pandemic and help get the vaccine for my age group. My motivation to do that was stronger than any hesitancy I felt about blood draws or side effects.  A week or two after I decided to participate, I had my first visit. My weight, height and blood pressure were checked and they gave me my first shot. The next day I had a headache, sore throat, chills and arm pain. I hoped that it meant I got the vaccine and not a placebo.    Some of my friends from school also participated or applied to participate. We all wanted to be done with the pandemic and move forward as fast as we could. We were, like, really motivated to help out.  After my second visit in early January, I had similar symptoms except a little stronger. Later we found out that I did get the vax. I was protected, although I kept wearing a mask, social distancing and washing my hands.  It will be a special memory that I was able to help on the frontlines, trying to fight back against the virus. It'll be a memorable moment in time that will impact me for the rest of my life.  Photo:  Caleb, second from left, with his family (his dad Richard, brother Joshua, and mom Gina).  It's been a positive experience for Caleb, Joshua, and for our family—seeing the success of the vaccine and knowing that we were able to contribute. Vaccines for children are key to ending this pandemic. Children can get severely ill and    hospitalized from COVID , which we've seen happen in rising numbers since summer.  The good news is that, based on clinical trial data that Caleb and so many other children and teens participated in, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized COVID vaccines for kids age  5 and up . Clinical trials continue for children as young as six months old. We're super proud of Caleb, Joshua, and all the other kids who have given of themselves so that vaccination could move forward and everybody can benefit.

Before the FDA, companies could make claims about a product, without proof that it was safe or that it even worked. This made consumers extremely vulnerable. Now, new products must go through the FDA approval process before they are available to the public. Why is the FDA Approval Process Important?  FDA approval is important, because it v alidates the  need for research on how drugs work on children, not just adults. It also allows us the properly determine t he appropriate d osage for children,  determine the best route of administration, and test for  any drug interactions.  How Does a Drug or Device Get FDA Approval? In order to receive FDA approval for a drug or a medical device, the manufacturer must prove to the FDA that the item is \"safe and effective.\" Although no drug or medical device is entirely risk-free, the research and testing must show that the benefits of the drug or device for a particular condition outweigh the risks to patients of using the item. Here's a brief overview of the steps involved in a drug becoming FDA-approved: Drug Developed:  A company develops a new drug and seeks to have it approved by the FDA for sale in the United States. Animal Testing:  Before testing the drug on people, the company must test the new drug on animals to find out whether it has the potential to cause serious harm (i.e. toxicity). IND Application:  The company submits an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA based on the results from the initial animal testing. These results must include the drug's composition and manufacturing and the proposed plan for testing the drug on people. Clinical Trials:  After the FDA reviews and approves the IND application,  clinical trials  to test the drug on people can begin. There are 4 phases of clinical trials, starting with small-scale trials, followed by large-scale trials. After the clinical trials, the researchers then submit study reports to the FDA. NDA Application:  Once a drug developer provides evidence that the drug is safe and effective, the company can file a New Drug Application (NDA). The FDA reviews the application and makes a decision to approve or not approve the drug. Drug Labeling:  The FDA reviews the drug's labeling/packaging and makes sure appropriate information is communicated to health care professionals and consumers.    Facility Inspection:  The FDA inspects the facilities where the drug will be manufactured. Drug Approval:   The FDA approves the NDA or issues a response letter. Post-Marketing Monitoring:  Once the FDA approves the drug, the company is required to submit periodic safety updates to the FDA. Do Over-the-Counter Drugs and Medical Devices Need FDA Approval? Yes. Drugs sold  over-the-counter  (without a prescription) must be approved by the FDA. For instance, over-the-counter pain medications must be FDA-approved to treat pain. What is Considered When Rescheduling A Drug? The Controlled Substances Act (CSA), part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, is the legal cornerstone of the government’s war against drug abuse. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has divided these substances into five categories, called “schedules,” based on each drug’s (1) potential for abuse, (2) safety, (3) addictive potential and (4) whether or not it has any legitimate medical applications.. Schedule I is reserved for drugs considered to have the highest  potential for abuse  and no current accepted medical use. Rescheduling  marijuana , for example, would not make it legal but reclassifying the schedule could potentially increase research being done on the drug.  Click here  to learn more about the FDA's drug approval approcess and marijuana.  Additional Information: Should My Child Join a Clinical Trial?

        "content": "Antibiotics are powerful medicines to fight certain germs, but they aren't the answer for every infection your child gets. In fact, there are two major types of germs that cause most infections⁠—viruses and bacteria⁠—antibiotics are useful only against bacteria. Here's what parents need to know. What are bacteria? Bacteria are one-celled organisms that are just a few thousandths of a millimeter in size. They live on our skin, in our    digestive system  and in our mouths and throats. In fact, there are one hundred trillion bacteria living and thriving on or inside of us. Most are either harmless or serve a purpose in the body (such as helping to break down the nutrients in our diet). However, some bacteria are dangerous and cause illnesses. Harmful bacteria are responsible for many childhood diseases, like    strep throat  or    urinary tract infections . What are viruses? Viruses are even smaller than bacteria—1,000 times smaller. Despite their size, viruses can cause diseases when they enter healthy cells in the body. They're responsible for the  common cold , the    flu  and most    sore throats and coughs . They also cause    smallpox ,    the measles , the    mumps ,    hepatitis , and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ). As powerful as antibiotics are when used in the right situations, they cannot kill viruses, and they do not work against viral infections. If they're given to your child when they have a viral infection, they can cause side effects. Taking antibiotics when they're not needed can also add to the serious problem of    antibiotic resistance  and difficult-to-treat \"superbugs.\"  There are drugs called antivirals that have been developed to fight a few types of viruses. However, there are currently no antiviral medicines to treat the most common viruses that cause sore throats, coughs and runny noses. Are antibiotic medicines available in different forms and types? Antibiotics are available in several forms for children. These include tablets, capsules, liquids and chewable pills. Some antibiotics come as ointments and others come as drops (such as for ear infections).  There are also many types of antibiotics. Some, such as penicillin, kill bacteria by destroying the bacterial cell wall. Others, such as tetracycline, interfere with the ability of bacteria cells to reproduce or make proteins or nutrients they need to survive. When your pediatrician prescribes an antibiotic, they will choose the best one for the specific germ that is making your child sick. What are broad-spectrum antibiotics? Some antibiotics are called broad-spectrum and can fight many types of germs in the body, while others are more specific. It's best to use the most narrow-spectrum antibiotic that will only fight the germ that's causing the infection. Sometimes, your pediatrician can use a test to identify the specific bacteria causing your child's infection, which helps target those germs without killing other \"good\" bacteria. What are some possible side effects of antibiotics? As powerful and useful as antibiotics can be, they can have side effects. In children, they can cause stomach discomfort, diarrhea and/or nausea. Some children have an allergic reaction to penicillin and other antibiotics, producing symptoms such as severe skin rashes or breathing difficulties. If you think your child could be having an allergy to an antibiotic, call your pediatrician right away. Are antibiotics ever used to prevent illnesses? While antimicrobial drugs are mostly used to    treat  infections that your infant or child may develop, they are sometimes prescribed to    prevent  an illness from developing. For example, children who have frequent    urinary tract infections  are sometimes given antibiotics to reduce the likelihood that they'll recur. These medicines can kill the bacteria before they have a chance to cause an infection. Other times preventive antibiotics may be prescribed for children could be after a    dog or animal bite  or before an    operation . These \"prophylactic\" antibiotics should always be given for the shortest period possible to reduces the chances of side effects or creating antimicrobial resistance. Remember If your child has a cold, antibiotics aren't the answer. It's sometimes difficult for parents to determine if their child's illness is caused by viruses or bacteria. For this reason, never try to diagnose and treat your child's illness yourself. Contact or visit your pediatrician's office.

        "content": "Pediatricians use different tests and tools to help them diagnose and treat injuries and illnesses. The information below will help answer parents' questions about imaging and medical radiation safety.\t What is imaging?\t Imaging tests are used to “see” inside the body. Some types of imaging use ionizing radiation. This includes x-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, and nuclear medicine (radionuclide) studies. Higher-dose radiation can also be used in therapy, for treatment of cancer, or for treatment of an overactive thyroid gland. \t Why does my child need an imaging test?\t Sometimes imaging tests are the only tests that can help diagnose certain illnesses. Your child’s doctor can then find out the best treatment options, avoid other tests or surgery, and improve your child’s health. \t Isn’t radiation harmful?\t The amount of radiation used in imaging tests is very low. In fact, no direct harm has been shown from the levels of radiation used in the imaging tests mentioned above. \t We are all exposed to small amounts of radiation daily from soil, rocks, air, water, and cosmic radiation. Most people are exposed to more radiation from the environment than from many of these tests. \t How safe is imaging?\t Special steps are taken to make sure your child is exposed to the smallest amount of radiation possible during imaging. The AAP belongs to the  Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging , which follows the following medical radiation safety guidelines:\t Imaging is to be used only if there is a definite medical benefit.\t Use the lowest amount of radiation possible for the test based on the size of the child.\t Imaging only includes the parts of the body that need to be evaluated.\t Use other diagnostic studies, like ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), when possible.\t If I still have concerns regarding radiation exposure to my child, whom should I talk with?\t First talk with the doctor who is ordering the exam. Medical professionals must balance the risks and benefits of performing a study. Your doctor and the radiologist can work together on decisions about which study is best to perform.\t If your doctor cannot answer your questions, radiologists can provide further information. Also listed at the end of this handout is a list of resources if you would like to find out more information.\t Types of Imaging\t The following are 3 types of imaging tests.\t ​\t ​X-rays\t ​CT scans\t ​Nuclear medicine studies\t Types of images taken​:\t ​2-dimensional pictures of the bones, lungs, and other organs.\t ​3-dimensional pictures of the body.\t ​Pictures of different organs and tissues that depend on how they work.\t ​ When this test may be needed:\t ​X-rays are usually used to see bones, organs (like the lungs), and air inside the body. Metal objects also can be seen.\t ​CT scans are very useful because they show more detailed pictures of organs than an ordinary x-ray. They can be used to find tumors, infections, or evidence of injury in different parts of the body.\t ​Organs including the kidneys, liver, heart, lungs, and brain can be studied with these exams. Bone scans can show trauma, infection, or a tumor before any problems are seen\t with x-rays.\t ​ What to expect during the test:\t  \t None of these tests are painful; however, it's important that your child be still during the tests. \t  \t ​Your child will need to stay still. Lead shields may be used to cover the parts not being imaged.\t  \t  \t Parents can stay in the same room and should wear a lead apron. Pregnant moms should not be in the room.\t  \t ​Your child will need to lie still on a table while it moves through a large scanner that looks like a donut.\t  \t  \t Nothing touches the child, but your child may be afraid of the large machine. An intravenous contrast to show blood vessels and/or a drink may occasionally be given if ordered by your doctor. Parents can stay in the same room and should wear a lead apron. Pregnant moms should not be in the room.\t  \t ​Before the test an intravenous line is usually needed to inject a radioactive drug called a tracer. Your child will need to stay still.\t  \t  \t A machine called a gamma camera scans the body detecting the rays of energy from the tracer, and an image is created and shown on a computer.\t Amount of radiation exposure: ​\t Very small amounts of radiation exposure to the areas being studied.​\t ​More radiation exposure than x-rays.\t ​The amount of radiation exposure depends on the type of study.",

        "content": "​​​​If your child is having surgery, it's natural to worry about pain after the procedure. It helps to know what to expect and ways to keep discomfort to a minimum. Some common questions parents may have: ​ Will my child​ have pain after surgery?  Some pain after surgery is normal. Where the pain is and how long it will last depend on the type of surgery. Sometimes, changing positions or holding your child can ease their pain. Other times, medicines may be needed to help keep your child comfortable. Your child's nurses and doctors will work with you to help manage your child's pain.  How do I know if my c​​hild is in pain?  Everyone feels pain in their own way. The team of specialists involved with the surgery will help you figure out if your child is hurting. Babies and young children may not be able to tell you when they're in pain, but they usually show some symptoms. They may be more irritable than usual, for example. They may cry more easily or have trouble settling down. Or, they may not be as interested in feeding. Older children will usually tell you that they are in pain. They may even be able to tell you exactly where it hurts and what makes the pain better or worse.  How is pain from surge​ry treated? \t Before the surgery.  During a clinic visit or on the day of surgery, you will be asked about any past surgeries and things that usually help calm your child. The doctor may also ask about any pain medicines that worked well for your child in the past. This is a good time to ask any questions you have about how your child might feel after surgery.  Some children may feel anxious about the surgery and whether it will hurt. Studies show that children who are especially nervous before surgery tend to have more pain after the procedure. Talking with them about what to expect after surgery and how pain will be controlled can help ease their minds.  Your child might find it calming to listen to music before the surgery. A younger child might feel more at ease with their favorite toy. A child life specialist can also help your child feel more comfortable by talking or playing with them. In addition, the doctor can prescribe medicine to help them feel less nervous. \t In the operating room.  Good pain control starts during surgery. When possible, your child will get “numbing medicine\" (local anesthetic) at the surgery site. Sometimes this can be used to numb the surrounding area, too (a regional block). Depending on the type of surgery, your child may also have the option to get pain medicine given into the space around the spinal cord. This can block pain for several hours to days. This is called either a “caudal block\" or an “epidural.\" During the surgery, your child may also breathe in medicines and receive others through a vein to make sure they are comfortable. \t After surgery.  The goal is to make sure that your child is comfortable and is still able to get up and move around. To strike this balance, different types or medicines may be used, rather than relying on overly strong ones. Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, ketorolac, gabapentin, and clonidine are common choices. Opioids such as morphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, or oxycodone are sometimes needed and are safe when given in low doses for a short period of time. \t At home.  Many children are more comfortable and less anxious at home. Getting your child home as soon as possible is a top priority. It is important you feel prepared to take care of your child after leaving the hospital. The doctors and nurses will go over any pain medicines and other plans to keep your child comfortable at home. Be sure to follow any directions you're given about what medicine your child should take and how often it should be taken.  In addition to medicines, there are ways you can help make your child more comfortable at home. \t Ice packs  can help reduce swelling, which can decrease pain. Your child's surgical discharge team can explain how long and how often to use an ice pack. \t Distraction , like reading books, playing games and watching movies, can help your child cope with discomfort. \t A warm bath  can also help ease pain, but check with your child's doctor how long to wait before getting the surgical site wet. \t Stretching and walking , once your child's doctor says it's OK, can help with stiffness and pain. \t A parent's touch  or light massage, as long as it's far enough away from the surgery site, can help reduce pain. \t Loose, comfortable clothing  can help prevent irritation around the surgical site.  ​​​Will my child become addicted to the str​onger pain medications? \t   When used at the lowest dose possible and for the shortest period of time possible,                     addiction  is very rare. If your child needs opioid pain medicines (morphine, hydrocodone, oxycodone etc.) after surgery, it is important to                     store the medicines safely , out of reach of children and pets. Be sure to                     properly throw away  any extra medicines when they are not needed anymore. Opioid pain medicines can be returned to a drug take-back program or safe drop site. Find a site at                     https://deadiversion.usdoj.gov . If there is no disposal site near you, mix unused medicine with coffee grounds or kitty litter in a plastic bag and throw it in the trash.​ When should I call my child's do​ctor?  If your child has any of the following problems after surgery, call the doctor:  Pain that seems to be getting worse, is more intense or in a different location.  Pain does not get better with the pain medicine your child has been prescribed.  You have any questions about which type or when to give a pain medicine.   ​   ​Additional Info​rmation:\t Fever and Pain Medicine: How Much to Give Your Child What is a Pediatric Surgeon?​   What to Expect if Your Child is Admitted to the Hospital​\t American Pediatric Surgical Association: Pain Management​ ​",

        "content": "Is it OK to give my child \"natural\" therapies when she's sick? \t While most children in North America receive conventional medicine when they are sick, many parents want to know about natural therapies too. Alternative, complementary, and integrative medicine and folk remedies are some of the words used to describe these different therapies. Here's a few things you should know: \t Q: Are all “natural” therapies safe? \t A: No. Therapies are not safe just because they are natural. Side effects from natural therapies are rare but can occur. Check with your child’s doctor before adding or changing a therapy. Talk about what you’ve heard and read about natural therapies. Bring the products you give your child to your next medical appointment. \t Q: Does the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate natural products? \t A: Yes. The FDA regulates natural products such as dietary supplements. But they are regulated as a food and not as medicine. While most people can avoid buying rotten tomatoes or bruised fruit, it’s much harder to avoid poor-quality supplements. The FDA does not guarantee the purity, potency, effectiveness, or safety of natural products sold as dietary supplements. \t Q: Do natural therapies really work? \t A: More research is needed for all kinds of therapies for children, including natural therapies. Some work for children with certain conditions but not for children with other conditions. This is true for conventional and natural therapies. For example, massage may help reduce stress, but it is not a cure for cancer. \t Q: Do you need a special license to practice complementary medicine? \t A: Each state has different licensing rules. Check with the licensing board for your state to find out if a health care professional has a license to practice. If your state does not require a license to practice (for example, some states do not license acupuncturists), be sure the professional is certified by a national professional organization. Always ask about a practitioner’s training and experience. Find out if the practitioner has been specifically trained to treat children and how many children he or she treats each week. \t Q: Will insurance pay for it? \t A: Insurance companies and flexible medical spending accounts have many different plans that cover different things. There is often less coverage for complementary therapies than for conventional care. Check with your insurance company. \t Q: Why is it important to talk with my child’s doctor about these treatments? \t A: Talking with your child’s doctor helps you know if a treatment is safe and effective. Talk about all therapies given to your child including vitamins, herbs, or other supplements. This is especially important because there can be dangerous side effects when medicines or therapies are given at the same time. Include information about other health professionals caring for your child so care can be coordinated. \t Ask all your child’s health care professionals to talk with each other. Open communication is the best way to promote the safest care possible.",

        "content": "​ ​​Fast Facts: One in 10 young people in the US experiences recurrent         headaches . One in 3 young people ages 10 to 17 who regularly experience headaches are turning to some type of \"natural\" or integrative medical therapy, which consists of the use of conventional,         complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)  for prevention and treatment.  What are your responsibilities as a parent when considering a natural therapy for your child? If you are exploring      natural therapies  to treat your child's headaches, it is important for you to educate yourself fully on the pros and cons of each approach and      discuss the options thoroughly with your child's pediatrician before you take any action. Mind and Body Approaches: Massage\t Massage therapy may be helpful for a child with chronic daily headaches  and includes a variety of techniques in which practitioners manipulate the soft tissues of the body. Massage therapy can be used in conjunction with a healthy diet, regular exercise, stress management, and avoidance of headache triggers. There are relatively few side effects when massage is performed by a trained practitioner, but its use should be discussed with the child's pediatrician to be sure they know every therapy your child is receiving. Acupuncture\t Acupuncture may also benefit a child with headaches . This ancient Chinese remedy involves a practitioner inserting thin needles through the skin, which releases endorphins, and reduces the perception of pain. Treatment usually occurs one or two times a week for 4 to 6 weeks. There are few side effects and many children tolerate acupuncture well with a practitioner trained in treating children. Due to needle insertion, rarely mild bleeding and bruising can be seen. Infection is very rare.  Biofeedback\t Biofeedback is one of the treatments researched most extensively for migraines.  It measures body functions so that the child can learn to control them. For example, a biofeedback device may show tension in a child's neck muscles in the back of the head that are causing the headaches. By watching how these measurements change, the child becomes more aware of when his or her muscles are tense and learns to relax them. Several biofeedback programs and devices are available in clinics or at medical centers, but also available for home use. Biofeedback is generally safe to use and does not have any harmful side effects.  Guided Imagery\t Guided imagery, self-hypnosis, or relaxation can be helpful for preventing headaches.  Children are often great at this technique, as it uses their imagination and mental images to promote relaxation. Some pediatricians are trained in these relaxation skills or may refer you to another trained practitioner who work with your child.  Dietary Supplements for Headache Prevention: Certain nutritional and herbal      dietary supplements  have been studied for prevention or decreasing the pain that comes with headaches.      All dietary supplements should be discussed with the child's pediatrician before use. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)\t Riboflavin is a B-vitamin that may reduce the number of headaches and pain.  Rare side effects may include diarrhea, increased amount of urination, and yellowish discoloration of urine.  Magnesium\t Magnesium supplements may also help reduce the number of headaches if taken for several months.  Magnesium deficiency is related to factors that promote headaches. Teens who get migraines may have lower levels of magnesium in their bodies than those who do not. The typical diet of an American teenager may be deficient in magnesium-rich foods such as dark green leafy vegetables, beans, seeds, nuts, and whole grains. Magnesium supplements can cause diarrhea and may interact with some medications. They should be used only under the supervision of your child's pediatrician. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)\t Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant present in each cell of our bodies; however, it was found to be deficient in one third of children with migraines.  Taken as a dietary supplement, it may help lower the frequency of headaches. It is generally well-tolerated by children without significant side effects. Rare and mild GI symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, and heartburn have occurred. Butterbur\t Butterbur is an herb extract that may reduce the number and severity of migraine headaches.  The most common side effects include fatigue, belching, nausea, diarrhea, heartburn, itchy eyes or skin, and allergic reaction for those children allergic to ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds or daisies. Raw butterbur contains chemicals called pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). PAs can damage the liver and kidneys and result in serious illness. Only butterbur products that are certified as PA-free should be used.  A Final Reminder: If you've made the decision to seek a natural therapy for your child's headaches, it is of utmost importance to involve your child's pediatrician in the process. He or she may also be able to assist in evaluating your child's response to that treatment.

        "content": "When children have a chronic, serious illness or disability, their parents may turn to  \"natural\" therapies . Other terms that describe these therapies include  alternative ,  complementary , and folk remedy.  In some cases, natural therapies may may be used in addition to the care their child receives from their pediatrician or other mainstream practitioner. Families may turn to natural therapies even when they're happy with this traditional care, because they are willing to try everything and anything to help their child. In some cases, however, may turn to them when they become frustrated with all that mainstream medicine can offer their child. Better together: how your pediatrician can help If you've made the decision to seek natural therapies for your child's care, involve your pediatrician in the process. In most cases, such therapies work best when used in combination with traditional medical care. Your doctor may be able to help you better understand these therapies, whether they have scientific merit, whether claims about them are accurate or exaggerated and whether they pose any risks to your child's well-being. Natural doesn't always mean safe Keep in mind that a \"natural\" treatment does not always mean a \"safe\" one. Your pediatrician can help you determine whether there is a risk of  interactions  with your child's other medications. The American Academy of Pediatrics has encouraged pediatricians to: Evaluate the scientific merits of natural therapies Determine whether they might cause any direct or indirect harm Advise parents on the full range of treatment options If you decide to use a natural therapy, your pediatrician also may be able to assist in evaluating your child's response to that treatment.

        "content": "​Clinical trials are research studies designed to learn more about ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases. Clinical trials can also help people with      chronic  (long-term) illnesses find better ways to live each day with their illness.  The goal of a clinical trial for children is to find out whether a treatment is safe, helpful, and well tolerated by children. Researchers may study new drugs, vaccines, devices, or procedures, or new ways to use current treatments. Before you and your child decide whether a clinical trial may be a good option for your child, it's important to know more about the study, including the risks and benefits.  Why are clinical trials for children needed? It's important to study new treatments in children because children are not little adults. Children have different treatment needs than adults, and sometimes they have different diseases than adults. Also, dosages of medicine, sizes of devices, or types of therapy may change over time, according to each child's needs and stage of growth.  A successful clinical trial can create a new standard of care for children with certain conditions. Without this standard of care, treatment for children may need to be based on what works for adults. For example, most medicines given to children as part of standard treatments have been tested only in adults. When medicine that has been tested only in adults is given to children, this is called     \t off-label use  of the medicine.  In recent years, laws have been passed that require pediatric clinical trials for certain conditions. As a result, the number and range of clinical trials for children have expanded.  How are clinical trials done? Each clinical trial follows a detailed plan called a      protocol . A protocol is carefully designed to minimize the risks of the study, to increase the chance of getting useful results, and to answer specific research questions. It includes a description of who can and cannot participate, the likely length of the study, information about what is being tested, and how information will be collected. \t   NOTE:  Before clinical trials of new medicines begin, these medicines are first tested and studied in a laboratory and in animals.  What are the benefits and risks of a clinical trial? Clinical trials are done because we do not know the best treatments of many diseases or because researchers believe that a new treatment may work better than current treatments. However, as with any new or existing treatment, there may be certain benefits and risks. Also, sometimes the risks and benefits are unknown.      Possible Benefits My child may have access to new drugs or treatments that are not yet available and may be more effective. My child will help provide information that will benefit children in the future. My child may receive extra care from caregivers. My child may receive closer monitoring or extra testing that may not be a part of regular care. My child (we) may have access to more information about the condition or illness. Financial rewards or other incentives may be offered. Possible Risks My child may find the treatment unpleasant or there may be harmful side effects that can range from minimal to serious or life-threatening. Treatment may be ineffective. Treatment may involve a lot of time, including visits to the study site, more blood tests, more treatments, or hospital stays. My child may need to follow complex medicine dosing or procedures. What do I need to know before I sign up my child for a clinical trial? If you and your child are interested in a clinical trial or have been asked to join one, it's important that you know all the facts. As part of the clinical trial process, informed consent ensures that parents are fully informed and can ask questions about the clinical trial. Informed consent grants permission but is not a contract. Parents and children can leave a clinical trial at any time. However, for some children, doctors may recommend that certain steps are taken before treatment is completely ended, depending on what is safest for the child.  In addition to informed consent from parents, assent from children in many clinical trials is also required. Assent is the term used to describe when a child agrees to be in a clinical trial. Before children are asked whether they want to assent to join a clinical trial, they must first be old enough to understand basic facts about the clinical trial and be able to ask questions about the trial.  Your care team would be involved in helping you and your child make those important decisions.  What questions should I ask about a clinical trial? Before you and your child join a clinical trial, it's important that each of you understands the process from start to finish. The following questions about clinical trials can help:  About the Trial What is the purpose of the trial? Is there an age range that qualifies my child for the trial? Who is sponsoring or funding the trial? (Sponsors may be organizations or individuals—including medical doctors, foundations, medical institutions, voluntary groups, and biopharmaceutical companies—as well as federal agencies.) Why do the researchers believe that the treatment being studied may be better than the one being used now? Why may it not be better? What kinds of tests and treatments are involved? How will the doctor know whether the treatment is working? How and when will we be told about the trial's results? Will we be told about changes in the study that might make us want to quit the study? When do we need to decide about joining this trial? Who can answer questions before, during, and after the trial? Who will be in charge of care? Benefits and Risks What are possible benefits? What are possible side effects or risks? How do possible risks and benefits of this trial compare with those of standard treatment? If my child receives a placebo, could that be harmful to his or her care? Privacy and Rights Will I have access to my child's test results throughout the trial? How will my child's health information be kept private? Who will have access to my child's information? What happens if I want to take my child out of the trial? Costs Will I have to pay for any of the treatments or tests? What costs will my health insurance cover? Who pays the medical bills if my child is injured in the trial? Who can help answer questions from my insurance company? Are any personal costs such as meals or gas paid for by the organization or individual running the clinical trial? Words to Know These are some of the medical and technical words are used by researchers and other professionals involved with clinical trials. assent —When a child agrees to be in a study. blinding or masking —When participants and usually study investigators do not know which medicine or treatment participants are getting until the end of the trial period. informed consent —Parents' permission for their child to join a research study after they have read an informed consent form, spoken with the investigators, read other materials about the study, and asked questions. interventional study —Another name for a clinical trial. investigators —People doing the research study. People on the research team may include doctors, nurses, research coordinators, social workers, and other health care professionals. Each clinical study is led by a principal investigator, who is often a medical doctor. Institutional Review Board (IRB) —An independent committee who ensures that clinical trials are ethical and that the rights of the people in the study are protected. Each clinical trial in the United States must be approved and monitored by an IRB. Members of an IRB include doctors, statisticians, and members of the community. participants or subjects —Volunteers who enroll in a research study. placebo —A pill, liquid, or powder without active medicine in it. Placebos are given to children only when withholding treatment poses minimal risks. protocol —Detailed plan of the research study. randomization —A way to choose what treatment each person in a study gets so that there is less chance of bias. It's like flipping a coin or rolling dice—the results are random and are by chance, not choice. Time How long is the trial? How often and for how long will my child have to go to the hospital or clinic? Will my child have to stay in the hospital during the clinical trial? If so, how often and for how long? How much time will be spent traveling to and from the hospital or clinic? Will my child have checkups after the trial? Other Choices What are other treatment choices, including standard treatments? How does treatment my child would receive in this trial compare with other treatment choices? What will happen to my child's illness or disease without treatment?

        "content": "Antibiotics: What’s in a Name?  The term antibiotics literally means “against life”; in this case, against microbes. There are many types of antibiotics—antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals, and antiparasitics. Some drugs are effective against many organisms; these are called broad-spectrum antibiotics. Others are effective against just a few organisms and are called narrowspectrum antibiotics. The most commonly used antibiotics are antibacterials. Your child may have received ampicillin for an ear infection or penicillin for a strep throat.  When a child is sick, parents worry. Even if he has only a mild cold that makes him cranky and restless or an achy ear that only hurts a little, these times can be very stressful. Of course, you want him to get the best possible treatment. For many parents, this means taking him to the pediatrician and leaving the office with a prescription for antibiotics.  But that isn’t necessarily what will happen during the doctor’s visit. After examining your youngster, your pediatrician may tell you that based on your child’s symptoms and perhaps some test results, antibiotics just are not necessary. Many parents are surprised by this decision. After all, antibiotics are powerful medicines that have eased human pain and suffering for decades. They have even saved lives. But most doctors aren’t as quick to reach for their prescription pads as they once were. In recent years, they’re realizing there is a downside to choosing antibiotics—if these medicines are used when they’re not needed or they’re taken incorrectly, they can actually place your child at a greater health risk. That’s right—antibiotics have to be prescribed and used with care, or their potential benefits will decrease for everyone.  A Look Back  Serious diseases that once killed thousands of youngsters each year have been almost eliminated in many parts of the world because of the widespread use of childhood vaccinations.  In much the same way, the discovery of antimicrobial drugs (antibiotics) was one of the most significant medical achievements of the 20th century. There are several types of antimicrobials—antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals, and antiparasitic drugs. (Although antibacterials are often referred to by the general term antibiotics, we will use the more precise term.) Of course, antimicrobials aren’t magic bullets that can heal every disease. When used at the right time, they can cure many serious and life-threatening illnesses.  Antibacterials are specifically designed to treat bacterial infections. Billions of microscopic bacteria normally live on the skin, in the gut, and in our mouths and throats. Most are harmless to humans, but some are pathogenic (disease producing) and can cause infections in the ears, throat, skin, and other parts of the body. In the pre-antibiotic era of the early 1900s, people had no medicines against these common germs and as a result, human suffering was enormous. Even though the body’s disease-fighting immune system can often successfully fight off bacterial infections, sometimes the germs (microbes) are too strong and your child can get sick. For example,  Before antibiotics, 90% of children with bacterial meningitis died. Among those children who lived, most had severe and lasting disabilities, from deafness to mental retardation.  Strep throat was at times a fatal disease, and ear infections sometimes spread from the ear to the brain, causing severe problems.  Other serious infections, from tuberculosis to pneumonia to whooping cough, were caused by aggressive bacteria that reproduced with extraordinary speed and led to serious illness and sometimes death.  The Emergence of Penicillin  With the discovery of penicillin and the dawning of the antibiotic era, the body’s own defenses gained a powerful ally. In the 1920s, British scientist Alexander Fleming was working in his laboratory at St. Mary’s Hospital in London when almost by accident, he discovered a naturally growing substance that could attack certain bacteria. In one of his experiments in 1928, Fleming observed colonies of the common Staphylococcus aureus bacteria that had been worn down or killed by mold growing on the same plate or petri dish. He determined that the mold made a substance that could dissolve the bacteria. He called this substance penicillin, named after the Penicillium mold that made it. Fleming and others conducted a series of experiments over the next 2 decades using penicillin removed from mold cultures that showed its ability to destroy infectious bacteria.  Before long, other researchers in Europe and the United States started recreating Fleming’s experiments. They were able to make enough penicillin to begin testing it in animals and then humans. Starting in 1941, they found that even low levels of penicillin cured very serious infections and saved many lives. For his discoveries, Alexander Fleming won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine.  Drug companies were very interested in this discovery and started making penicillin for commercial purposes. It was used widely for treating soldiers during World War II, curing battlefield wound infections and pneumonia. By the mid- to late 1940s, it became widely accessible for the general public. Newspaper headlines hailed it as a miracle drug (even though no medicine has ever really fit that description).  With the success of penicillin, the race to produce other antibiotics began. Today, pediatricians and other doctors can choose from dozens of antibiotics now on the market, and they’re being prescribed in very high numbers. At least 150 million antibiotic prescriptions are written in the United States each year, many of them for children.  Problems With Antibiotics  The success of antibiotics has been impressive. At the same time, however, excitement about them has been tempered by a phenomenon called antibiotic resistance. This is a problem that surfaced not long after the introduction of penicillin and now threatens the usefulness of these important medicines.  Almost from the beginning, doctors noted that in some cases, penicillin was not useful against certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus (bacteria that causes skin infections). Since then, this problem of resistance has grown worse, involving other bacteria and antibiotics. This is a public health concern. Increasingly, some serious infections have become more difficult to treat, forcing doctors to prescribe a second or even third antibiotic when the first treatment does not work.  In light of this growing antibiotic resistance, many doctors have become much more careful in the way they prescribe these medicines. They see the importance of giving antibiotics only when they’re absolutely necessary. In fact, one recent survey of office-based physicians, published in JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association in 2002, showed that doctors lowered the number of antibiotic prescriptions they prescribed for children with common respiratory infections by about 40% during the 1990s.  Antibiotics should be used wisely and only as directed by your pediatrician. Following these guidelines, their life-saving properties will be preserved for your child and generations to come.",

        "content": "Every person encounters infectious organisms throughout the day in the air, in soil and water, in foods, and on surfaces everywhere. Fortunately, your child’s immune system is capable of resisting most of these organisms, keeping her healthy. When these organisms become a problem and cause an infection, your pediatrician has a number of medicines that can help your child get better. \t Antibacterials are the prescription drugs with which parents are probably most familiar. Nearly every parent has had the experience of giving their child a course of antibacterials for an ear infection or strep throat. Most can name some of the most common antibacterials—penicillin, amoxicillin, tetracycline—that have helped their youngster fight off bacterial infections. Although your child has probably been given antibacterials more often than other types of infection-fighting prescription medicines, drugs are also available to fight certain childhood diseases caused by \t Viruses   \t Fungi (yeasts and molds)   \t Parasites \t Remember, as important as antibacterials are, they are useful only against infections caused by bacteria. For illnesses caused by other kinds of germs, antibacterials simply will not help your child get better. They can actually add risks because of the possible side effects that all medicines have. At the same time, inappropriately used medicines can contribute to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. \t Antiviral Medicines \t Every child gets a viral illness from time to time. Many viral infections affect the respiratory tract, which includes the nose, throat, and breathing passages where they can cause the common cold, the flu, a sore throat, and sinusitis. Viruses also can cause more serious illnesses such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), hepatitis, and rabies. Because immunizations are available to protect your child against some viral infections (eg, chickenpox, polio), make sure she is fully protected by all the vaccines recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. \t Antiviral drugs are relatively recent developments, but an increasing number of these virus-fighting drugs are now available. They are made to prevent infection or shorten the duration of infections by preventing the virus from spreading, although they may not kill viruses that already exist. These medicines aren’t appropriate for all viral infections—if your child has the common cold, for instance, simply let it run its course. Your pediatrician will be able to tell you when prescription antiviral drugs may be needed. \t Unlike broad-spectrum antibiotics, which are often useful against a wide range of bacterial organisms, antiviral medicines tend to be more specific and attack particular viruses. Here are a few examples of antiviral drugs sometimes prescribed for children.   \t Acyclovir is a medicine that can be used to treat chickenpox, as well as the symptoms associated with herpes infections that may affect the skin, eyes, mouth, genitals, or brain. Acyclovir can ease the discomfort and speed up the healing of herpes sores, but it will not completely kill the virus. The herpes simplex virus will stay dormant in the body and can cause symptoms again in the future.   \t Amantadine is among several antiviral medications that can be used to treat and prevent the flu. These medicines are most useful when started soon after your child’s flu symptoms begin. In general, the medicine should be started within the first 2 days of the illness. Amantadine is only effective in treating one type of flu virus, influenza A.   \t Ribavirin and interferon are antiviral drugs sometimes prescribed for adults who develop chronic hepatitis. Their use in children has been limited. \t Other medicines, called antiretroviral drugs, are used to combat infections caused by a particular type of virus called a retrovirus. The most widely known retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is responsible for AIDS. \t Keep in mind that even though viral illnesses should not be treated with antibacterials, bacterial infections sometimes occur as a secondary complication of a viral disease. In those cases, antibacterials can be used to treat the bacterial infection. \t Antifungal Medicines \t Fungal infections are caused by microscopic plants whose spores become airborne and are breathed in by children. They can also enter the body through a cut in the skin. When these spores are inhaled, they may settle in the lungs and begin to multiply and form clusters. Eventually they make their way into the bloodstream and travel throughout the body. Like many infectious organisms, they can cause serious illnesses in children whose immune systems are already weakened by another disease such as cancer or AIDS. \t You’re probably most familiar with fungi such as mushrooms, yeast, mold, and mildew. Some fungi can live in the body and never cause any sickness. But others cause diseases, including common infections such as ringworm of the skin, hair, and nails; athlete’s foot; jock itch; and thrush or yeast infections (candidiasis). \t Many drugs can fight these fungal infections. They’re often available in a topical form that can be applied directly on the skin. Some are over-the-counter medicines, while others must be prescribed by your doctor. \t For serious fungal infections, pediatricians may select a medication called amphotericin B or newer antifungal drugs called azoles. Two of the most widely used azoles are fluconazole and itraconazole. Some prescription antifungal drugs are not licensed for use in children, largely because little research has been done with youngsters. These medicines should be used with care and your pediatrician’s guidance because they may have serious side effects. \t Although over-the-counter antifungal products are considered safe when used according to the instructions on the label, it’s always a good idea to talk with your pediatrician before treating your child with these medicines. \t Antiparasitic Medicines \t Parasites can cause childhood infections. In some parts of the world, they are a common cause of illness and death. In the Western world, adults and children often contract parasitic diseases while traveling to tropical regions of the world where these illnesses are most prevalent, such as rural Central and South America, Asia, and Africa. \t Some parasites are so tiny that they can’t be seen except under the microscope, while others are large enough to be viewed very easily with the naked eye. Most live in food, water, and soil. When they’re transmitted to your child, often when she consumes contaminated food or water, her immune system can successfully fight off many of them. Other parasites, however, can cause potentially serious infections. \t The parasitic infection best known to parents is pinworms, but others include malaria, tapeworms, hookworms, and trichinosis. Some antibacterials also work against parasites. Metronidazole can block the reproduction cycle of some parasites as well as some bacteria. There are some antiparasitic drugs that are only available directly from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and your doctor must specifically request them from the CDC. \t Resistance is increasingly becoming a problem with some antiparasitic medicines. For example, some drugs used to treat malaria are not as effective as they were in the past because of resistance. As a result, new antimalaria drugs are now in development and being studied in clinical trials. \t There are common myths that certain parasitic diseases are caused by poor hygiene and can only be prevented or treated by improving personal cleanliness. These are only myths. Medicines are available to treat parasitic infections. Your child’s cleanliness is not going to cure the infection. However, as with many other infectious diseases, including some parasitic illnesses, hand washing is important and a good way to avoid germs that can make your child sick.",
